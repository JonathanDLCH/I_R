23|FEELING THE DRAFT: QUALITY IN OUR ETHICAL DEBATE.REPORT ON THE DRAFT CODE OF PROFESSIONAL ETHICS PRODUCED BY THE LIBRARYASSOCIATION WORKING PARTY ON ETHICS. LIBRARIANS AND INFORMATION WORKERS IN THEUK ARE LATECOMERS TO THE QUESTION OF PROFESSIONAL ETHICS. A US CODE WASDEVELOPED IN 1938|, AND OTHER PROFESSIONS HAVE HAD CODES SINCE THE 19|THCENTURY. THE OVERRIDING REASON FOR SUCH A CODE IS THE PROTECTION OF THECLIENT, BUT IT ALSO OFFERS PROTECTION FOR THE PROFESSIONALS THEMSELVES, ANDCOULD ENHANCE THE STATUS OF THE PROFESSION. AT THE VERY HEART OF THE LA CODEIS RESPONSIVE AND RESPONSIBLE PROFESSIONALISM.
24|PROFESSIONAL ETHICS.CRITIQUE OF THE DRAFT CODE ON PROFESSIONAL ETHICS PRODUCED BY THE LIBRARYASSOCIATION. THE CODE IS BADLY WRITTEN, CONFUSED, SILLY, CONTRADICTORY ANDTHREATENS TO BRING THE LA INTO DISREPUTE. NOTES PROVIDE LITTLE ILLUMINATION;CODES OF ETHICS DO NOT PER SE BRING PROFESSIONALISM; A LIBRARIAN'S PRIMARYDUTY IS OFTEN TO A CORPORATE BODY; THERE IS CONFUSION ABOUT POSSIBLE CONFLICTSIN SERVICE; AND THE LIBRARY ASSOCIATION IS IMPUDENT IN SUGGESTING THAT IT WILLIMPOSE SANCTIONS ON THOSE WHO FAIL TO KEEP ABREAST OF DEVELOPMENTS INLIBRARIANSHIP.

DEFINES FACT INACCORDANCE WITH THE MARXIST THEORY AS AN ELEMENT OF OBJECTIVE REALITY. FACT ININFORMATICS IS A PIECE OF KNOWLEDGE WHOSE OBJECTIVE VERITY HAS BEENSUFFICIENTLY PROVED. FACTUAL INFORMATION AS A PIECE OF KNOWLEDGE, INVESTIGATEDIN THEORY AND PROVED IN PRACTICE, CANNOT BE CHALLENGED; IT CAN, HOWEVER, HAVEVARIOUS INTERPRETATIONS.

34|LIBRARY SCIENCE IN THEORY AND PRACTICE.IN THE USA, UK AND COMMUNIST COUNTRIES, LIBRARY SCIENCE IS NOW FULLYESTABLISHED AS A SCIENTIFIC DISCIPLINE AND INCLUDED AMONGST UNIVERSITYFACULTIES. SINCE THE 19|TH CENTURY, HOWEVER, OPINION IN WEST GERMANY HAS BEENDIVIDED AS TO WHETHER LIBRARY SCIENCE HAS ITS OWN THEORETIC BASIS OR WHETHERIT CONSISTS OF PURELY PRACTICAL KNOWLEDGE. EXAMINATION OF THE RESPECTIVEARGUMENTS SUGGESTS THAT LIBRARY SCIENCE CAN BE REGARDED AS AN APPLIED SCIENCECLOSELY LINKED WITH OTHER DISCIPLINES, E.G. INFORMATION SCIENCE,COMMUNICATION, CYBERNETICS AND LINGUISTICS. HISTORICAL ASPECTS OFLIBRARIANSHIP EMPHASISED HITHERTO SHOULD PLAY ONLY A SUBORDINATE ROLE; THEMAIN EMPHASIS MUST BE ON SCIENTIFICALLY BASED, ECONOMIC LIBRARY ADMINISTRATIONLINKED WITH RESEARCH.

HOWEVER, AS THE DECADEPROGRESSED, SEVERAL LEGISLATIVE BILLS FAVOURABLE TO PUBLIC LIBRARIES WEREENACTED. THESE FOLLOWED THE REVENUE SHARING ACT OF 1972|, WHICH PERMITTEDGOVERNMENT UNITS TO APPROPRIATE FUNDS ONLY FOR THE PURPOSES FOR WHICH THEIROWN REVENUES WERE EXPENDED. IN 1978|, REVENUE-SHARING FUNDS INCREASEDDRAMATICALLY AS A RESULT OF THE STATE LEGISLATORS' SECOND ATTEMPT TO PROVIDEPUBLIC LIBRARIES WITH ACCESS TO REVENUE-SHARING FUNDS, WITH THE PASSAGE OFSENATE-ENROLLED ACT NO. 208|.

SPECIALISED EDUCATION, ESPECIALLY IN-SERVICE COURSES, IS NECESSARY,BUT LIBRARIANS' COMPLAINTS ABOUT COMPUTERISATION MAY STEM FROM SEVERALPHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL FACTORS NOT YET FULLY EXPLORED. STAFF MAY FEELRULED BY THE MACHINE UNLESS ENCOURAGED TO UNDERSTAND THE SYSTEM THOROUGHLY ANDTAKE PART IN ORGANISING WORK PROCESSES. IN SETTING UP SAMKAT AT THE DANISHNATIONAL LIBRARY, CATALOGUERS HAVE BEEN FULLY INVOLVED IN THE 1|ST(CATALOGUING) STAGE, AND WILL TAKE PART IN FUTURE DEVELOPMENT OF THE SYSTEM TOENSURE CONSISTENCY. WHEN STAFF FEEL AT EASE WITH THE COMPUTER, ITS ADVANTAGESINCLUDE MAKING THEIR WORK LESS STRENUOUS BUT MORE STIMULATING (PROVIDEDGOOD-QUALITY PRINT-OUTS ARE ATTAINED) AND IMPROVING INTER-LIBRARY COOPERATIONAND SERVICE TO READERS. LIBRARIANS SHOULD REMAIN RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR WORKINGCONDITIONS, AND INTRODUCE TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPME NTS AT A SUITABLE TEMPO.

187|MICRO COMPUTER SYSTEMS.THE MICRO COMPUTER SYSTEM IS NOT UNIQUE, BUT JUST A SIMPLER VERSION OF THEMINI AND MAINFRAME. IT IS ONLY CHEAPER BECAUSE LESS IS PROVIDED, THEFACILITIES ARE INADEQUATE FOR MANY OPERATIONS, AND IF SIGNIFICANT ONCE-OFFPROGRAMME DEVELOPMENT IS REQUIRED, MOST COST ADVANTAGES OF A MICRO SYSTEM MAYBE LOST. DISCUSSES QUESTIONS WHICH SHOULD BE RAISED WHEN CONSIDERING MICROCOMPUTER SYSTEMS IN THE CONTEXT OF LIBRARY AUTOMATION AND INFORMATIONRETRIEVAL. SUGGESTS THAT PROCESSOR, MEMORY AND LOGIC BOARDS SHOULD COST NOMORE THAN 
62|,000|, AND MASS STORAGE SHOULD BE LIMITED TO FLOPPY DISCS AND/ORCASSETTE.
188|THE ROLE OF MICROCOMPUTERS IN LIBRARIES.RECENT ADVANTAGES IN LARGE SCALE INTEGRATION OF ELECTRONIC COMPONENTS ANDATTENDANT ADVANCES IN MASS STORAGE TECHNOLOGY OPENING THE POSSIBILITY OFAUTOMATION FOR MANY SMALL LIBRARIES THAT UP UNTIL NOW COULD NOT AFFORD TOAUTOMATE.

196|MOTIVATING EMPLOYEES.FOR MANY YEARS RESEARCHERS IN THE FIELD OF MANAGEMENT HAVE BEEN STUDYING,TESTING, THEORISING AND WRITING ABOUT JOB MOTIVATION, ITS CAUSES AND EFFECTS.JOB MOTIVATION, WHICH IS THE AMOUNT OF EFFORT DIRECTED TOWARD ATTAINING GOALSDESIRED BY THE ORGANISATION, IS A SUBJECT ABOUT WHICH ALL MANAGERS OF PEOPLE,INCLUDING LIBRARIANS, MUST HAVE SOME KNOWLEDGE.
197|MOTIVATION AND STAFF DEVELOPMENT.ARGUES THAT STAFF DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMMES AND ACTIVITIES DO NOT, IN THEMSELVES,MOTIVATE STAFF.

PROVIDES A CASE STUDY OF THE APPLICATION OF THESTAFF DEVELOPMENT PROCESS IN A LIBRARY SETTING.
200|TRAINING WITHOUT EDUCATION: A LOST CAUSE.FORMAL AND ONGOING TRAINING OF COMPUTER SEARCHERS IS FUNDAMENTAL TO THESUCCESS OF ANY COMPUTERISED INFORMATION SERVICE. ARGUES THAT ALL LIBRARY STAFFSHOULD BE EDUCATED IN THE USE OF COMPUTERS FOR REFERENCE WORK SO THAT COMPUTERSEARCHING CAN BE FULLY INTEGRATED INTO THE NORMAL EVERYDAY SERVICE. LIBRARIESMUST NOT FEEL THAT THEY HAVE FAILED IF THEY DECIDE TO ASK FOR A COMPUTERSEARCH RATHER THAN HUNT THROUGH BOOKS FOR THEMSELVES. BRIEFLY DISCUSSES THEADVANTAGES OF ON-LINE ACCESS TO REFERENCE BOOKS AND INDEXES TO POPULARPERIODICALS AND NEWSPAPERS.
201|PHILOSOPHER AND LIBRARIAN SIDE BY SIDE.THE HISTORY OF LIBRARIANSHIP REVEALS A CONSIDERABLE NUMBER OF LIBRARIANS WHOHAVE ALSO BEEN ACTIVE AS PHILOSOPHERS. IT WOULD APPEAR THAT THE LIBRARIAN ANDTHE PHILOSOPHER MUST SHARE A NUMBER OF COMMON CHARACTERISTICS. THE MOSTSTRIKING OF THESE CHARACTERISTICS IS THE UNBOUNDED THIRST FOR KNOWLEDGE. INADDITION, ALTHOUGH COURSES OF STUDY ARE AVAILABLE IN BOTH DISCIPLINES, THEKNOWLEDGE AND EXPERTISE OF BOTH LIBRARIAN AND PHILOSOPHER IS ONLY ACQUIREDAFTER YEARS OF EXPERIENCE. BOTH GROUPS SEEK TO CREATE ORDER IN THE MATERIALWHICH FORMS THE FOCUS OF THEIR ACTIVITIES AND ALTHOUGH NOT INNOVATORSTHEMSELVES, WILLINGLY OFFER THEMSELVES IN THE SERVICE OF OTHERS.

203|ON FINNISH LIBRARY ARCHITECTURE.THE AUTHOR IS OF THE OPINION THAT THE GROUND FLOOR IS THE MOST IMPORTANT AREAOF ANY LIBRARY BUILDING, AND IT SHOULD NOT BE USED FOR SECONDARY ACTIVITIES.IN JYVASKYLA LIBRARY BUILDING, AS IN MANY FINNISH LIBRARY BUILDINGS, THEACTUAL LIBRARY IS ACCOMMODATED ABOVE THE GROUND FLOOR LEVEL. A COMPETITION FORA DESIGN IS NORMALLY ORGANIZED. THIS WAS ALSO THE CASE IN JYVASKYLA. THIS ISNOT THE WAY TO GET BEST RESULTS, BECAUSE THE COOPERATION BETWEEN THE ARCHITECTAND THE LIBRARIAN ONLY BEGINS AFTER THE DESIGN IS COMPLETE. AN ARCHITECTSHOULD BE CHOSEN CAREFULLY AND THE LIBRARIAN OR A LIBRARY EXPERT AND THEARCHITECT SHOULD COOPERATE THROUGHOUT THE DESIGN OF THE BUILDING.
204|IS A FITTED CARPET HARMFUL TO ALLERGIC PEOPLE?.FITTED CARPETS HAVE BECOME POPULAR IN LIBRARIES BECAUSE THEY CUT DOWN NOISE.BUT IF CARPETS ARE NOT KEPT CLEAN AND ROOMS WELL VENTILATED THEY CAN CAUSEPROBLEMS FOR PEOPLE SUFFERING FROM RESPIRATORY AILMENTS. NEW CARPETS DO NOTCAUSE THIS TROUBLE. RESEARCH IN SWEDEN AND FINLAND SHOWS THAT CARPETS STAYDIRTY EVEN AFTER GOOD VACUUMING. GIVES COMPARATIVE FIGURES FOR THE AMOUNT OFDUST CAUSED BY DIFFERENT TYPES OF FLOOR COVERINGS, WHICH IS WHAT CAUSES THEALLERGIES.

511|FOR GOOD OR EVIL, LIBRARIANSHIP IS STERILE.LIBRARIANS FAIL TO ATTRACT THE RIGHT PEOPLE TO THEIR RANKS; THEY ARE NEITHERINVENTIVE NOR INNOVATIVE, THERE IS TOO LITTLE IN LIBRARIANSHIP TO JUSTIFY EVENA FIRST DEGREE; ONLY LIBRARIANS THEMSELVES WOULD CONSIDER THEIR OCCUPATION TOBE A PROFESSION; AND FELLOWSHIP SHOULD BE RESERVED FOR AWARD ON AN HONORARYBASIS (AND THEN ONLY RARELY). LIBRARIANSHIP SHOULD RECOGNISE ITS MODEST PLACEIN SOCIETY, RECRUIT THOSE WITH A NATURAL FLAIR FOR ORGANISATION, AND ORGANISEITSELF ALONG BUSINESSLIKE LINES TO PROVIDE A SERVICE THE NATURE OF WHICH DOESNOT NEED EXPLICATING EXCEPT TO THOSE MORE INTERESTED IN ABSTRACT PHILOSOPHYTHAN PRACTICAL UTILITY.

575|INFORMATION EDUCATION OF PUPILS AND THE ROLE OF THE TEACHER.THE 'INFORMATION EDUCATION' OF SCHOOL CHILDREN IS NOT JUST THE RESPONSIBILITYOF LIBRARIANS, BUT IT SHOULD BE AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE MODERN TEACHINGPROCESS IN EVERY SUBJECT. SCHOOL LIBRARIES HAVE TRADITIONALLY OPERATED ON ARUDIMENTARY LEVEL AS BOOKSTOCKS WITH LENDING OUTLETS-MOSTLY SUPPLYINGLITERATURE RELEVANT TO THE TEACHING OF THE MOTHER TONGUE. THIS IS NO LONGERADEQUATE AND SCHOOL LIBRARIES MUST BE TRANSFORMED INTO UP-TO-DATE INFORMATIONAND STUDY CENTRES. THE SLOVAK MINISTRY OF EDUCATION HAS ISSUED A DIRECTIVE NO3767|/1979| WHICH ENVISAGES SCHOOL LIBRARIES FULFILLING 3| ROLES' SUPPLYINGLIBRARY AND INFORMATION MATERIAL TO BOTH TEACHERS AND PUPILS; CONTRIBUTING TOTHE UPBRINGING OF THE NEW SOCIALIST GENERATION THROUGH WORKING WITH BOOKS;EDUCATING BOTH TEACHERS AND PUPILS TO USE INFORMATION SOURCES INDEPENDENTLYDURING INDIVIDUAL STUDY, CAREER SELECTION AND LEISURE. ACQUISITION MUST PLACEGREATER EMPHASIS ON SCIENTIFIC, TE CHNICAL AND OTHER SUBJECT ORIENTED BOOKS.
576|LIBRARY USER BEHAVIOR.THE STUDY IS DIVIDED INTO 4| SECTIONS' (1|) USER ATTRIBUTES; (2|) ANALYSIS OFUSER'S PERCEPTION OF WHICH SOURCES ARE MOST LIKELY TO PROVIDE THE DESIREDINFORMATION AS WELL AS HIS/HER SEARCH STRATEGY; (3|) USER'S PREFERENCE FOR APARTICULAR SOURCE VERSUS HIS/HER ACCEPTANCE OF ANY MATERIAL AS LONG AS IT WILLFURNISH THE DATA NEEDED; (4|) IMPACT OF MASS MEDIA, AND TELEVISION INPARTICULAR, ON INFORMATION SEEKING BEHAVIOUR.
577|USE STUDIES OF LIBRARY COLLECTIONS.EDITED VERSION OF 'USE AND THE USER' PRESENTED AT A COLLECTION DEVELOPMENTCOMMITTEE MEETING, 26| JUNE 79|. JUDGES THE MOST IMPORTANT GENERAL CONCLUSIONSREACHED SO FAR THROUGH LIBRARY MATERIALS USE STUDIES TO BE' (1|) RECORDED USEIN MANY LIBRARIES IS LOW; (2|) USE WITHIN THE LIBRARY PARALLELS CIRCULATION;(3|) PAST USE PREDICTS FUTURE USE; (4|) RECENT MATERIALS ARE USED MOREFREQUENTLY; AND (5|) AMERICANS USE FEW FOREIGN-LANGUAGE MATERIALS. DISCUSSESPROBLEMS OF MEASUREMENT AND INTERPRETATION.
578|AN EVALUATION OF CURRENT COLLECTION UTILIZATION METHODOLOGIES AND FINDINGS.A RECENT EVALUATION OF CURRENT RESEARCH INDICATES THAT THE USE OF LIBRARIESCANNOT BE COMPARED; BUT, THE USE OF LIBRARY COLLECTIONS CAN BE COMPARED IF THEOBJECTIVES FOR THE COLLECTIONS ARE THE SAME. THE REASONING BEHIND THIS THESISIS PROVIDED ALONG WITH AN EVALUATION OF CURRENT COLLECTION UTILISATIONMETHODOLOGIES AND FINDINGS. A SET OF VARIABLES THAT ARE TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR INCOMPARATIVE STUDIES IS ALSO PROVIDED.
579|THE RANGES OF LIFE INTERESTS AND READING INTERESTS AMONG ADULT USERS OF PUBLICLIBRARIES IN COMMUNITIES OF VARIOUS SIZES.(PHD THESIS-UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN.) DESCRIBES AQUESTIONNAIRE SURVEY OF USERS OF 6| ILLINOIS PUBLIC LIBRARIES SERVINGCOMMUNITIES OF VARIOUS SIZES. THE FINDINGS INDICATE THAT PUBLIC LIBRARIES TENDTO SERVE THE MORE EDUCATED, THE YOUNG, AND WHITE COLLAR WORKERS, WHO WEREINTERESTED IN A WIDE RANGE OF SUBJECTS. DISCUSSES THE IMPLICATIONS FOR LIBRARYACQUISITION POLICIES AND MAKES SUGGESTIONS FOR FURTHER RESEARCH IN RELATEDAREAS.
580|THE DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING OF A CONCEPTUAL MODEL OF PUBLIC LIBRARY USERBEHAVIOR.THE OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY WAS TO TEST THE FOLLOWING HIERARCHICAL MODEL'PUBLIC LIBRARY USE IS A FUNCTION OF (1|) INDIVIDUAL CHARACTERISTICS; (2|)AWARENESS OF LIBRARY SERVICES; (3|) PERCEIVED ACCESSIBILITY OF THE LIBRARY; (4|)PERCEIVED EASE OF USE OF THE LIBRARY; AND (5|) USE OF OTHER NON-PUBLICLIBRARIES. THE MODEL WAS TESTED WITH 4| DIFFERENT LIBRARY USE MEASURES-ADICHOTOMISED MEASURE OF USE AND NONUSE, AND, AMONG LIBRARY USERS, FREQUENCY OFUSE AND 2|-FACTOR ANALYTICALLY DERIVED INDEXES DESCRIPTIVE OF 2| DISTINCTLYDIFFERENT TYPES OF LIBRARY USE. TYPE 1| USE APPEARED TO MEASURE USE INTENSITY;TYPE 2|-IN-HOUSE USE. INTERVIEW DATA WERE COLLECTED FROM 202| RESIDENTS OFSYRACUSE, NEW YORK. RESULTS INDICATED THAT PUBLIC LIBRARY USERS PERCEIVED THELIBRARY AS MORE ACCESSIBLE THAN DID NONUSERS, AND USE FREQUENCY WAS RELATED TOAWARENESS OF SPECIAL LIBRARY PROGRAMMES, AS WAS INTENSITY OF USE, AND IN-HOUSEUSE WAS RELATED  TO USE OF OTHER LIBRARIES.
581|THE SUBJECT INTENSITY OF LIBRARY USE' SOME ASPECTS OF POLYTECHNIC LIBRARY USE.STUDIES OF SEVERAL ASPECTS OF LIBRARY USE IN POLYTECHNICS ARE REPORTED. ISSUESWERE INVESTIGATED IN 3| POLYTECHNIC LIBRARIES, REPRESENTING DIFFERENT LEVELS OFLIBRARY PROVISION, AND ANALYSED IN TERMS OF SIZE AND NOVELTY OF STOCK. NEWERSTOCK WAS FOUND TO BE PREFERRED ALMOST UNIVERSALLY, AND LARGER STOCKS WEREMORE HEAVILY USED.
582|GOVERNMENT DOCUMENTS USAGE IN AN ACADEMIC LIBRARY' THE CASE STUDY FROM IBADANUNIVERSITY LIBRARY.EXAMINES USAGE OF GOVERNMENT DOCUMENTS FOR RESEARCH AT IBADAN UNIVERSITYLIBRARY, NIGERIA. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT SUCH DOCUMENTS CONSTITUTE ASUBSTANTIAL PART OF THE MATERIALS USED FOR RESEARCH AND THAT STATISTICALPUBLICATIONS ARE THE MOST FREQUENTLY CONSULTED MATERIALS.
583|DOCUMENTATION AND LITERARY RESEARCH.A PAPER PRESENTED AT A 1980| QUEBEC CORPORATION DES BIBLIOTHECAIRESPROFESSIONNELS CONFERENCE, DISTINGUISHING THE INFORMATION NEEDS OF THELITERARY RESEARCHER FROM OTHER USER NEEDS. DISCUSSES IN DETAIL THE KIND OFDOCUMENTATION REQUIRED, AND SHOWS HOW THE NOTIONS OF OBSOLESCENCE ANDEXHAUSTIVITY ARE LARGELY IRRELEVANT. TO MEET THESE SPECIFIC NEEDS, QUEBECSHOULD ESTABLISH A UNION CATALOGUE OF RESEARCH RESOURCES AND A NATIONALRESEARCH LIBRARY; HERE THE COMPUTER IS NOT THE SOLUTION.
584|LIBRARIES AND SCIENCE.THE MAIN CONCERN OF LIBRARIES AND INFORMATION CENTRES SHOULD BE SPEEDY ANDEFFECTIVE SERVICE TO USERS. THEY MUST BE CONCERNED TO ELIMINATE ANYUNNECESSARY DELAYS, WHICH MAY CAUSE DELAYS IN THE SCIENTIST'S WORK. LIBRARIANSSHOULD TAKE AN ACTIVE INTEREST IN THE WORK OF THEIR USERS AND THEIR EDUCATIONAND PROFESSIONAL EXPERTISE SHOULD ALLOW THEM TO DO SO. A SURVEY IN THE SLOVAKACADEMY OF SCIENCE HAD SHOWN THAT MOST SOUGHT AFTER ARE INFORMATION SOURCES1|-3| YEARS OLD IN NATURAL SCIENCES AND MEDICINE, 1|-10| YEARS OLD IN THE SOCIALSCIENCES. GOOD ACQUISITION POLICY, QUALITY IN BIBLIOGRAPHICAL AND INFORMATIONSERVICES CONTRIBUTE TO FURTHER DEVELOPMENT AND SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNOLOGICALREVOLUTION.
585|USER SATISFACTION IN THE HUGH STEPHENS COLLEGE LIBRARY.A USER SURVEY WAS CONDUCTED AT THE HUGH STEPHENS COLLEGE LIBRARY TO DETERMINETHE DEGREE OF USER SATISFACTION AND IDENTIFY LIMITING FACTORS. ANALYSIS OFDATA FROM 203| DATA SHEETS COMPLETED BY PATRONS REQUESTING SPECIFIC TITLESREVEALS THAT ACQUISITIONS BY THE LIBRARY AND USER ERROR ARE MORE SIGNIFICANTLIMITING FACTORS IN THIS LIBRARY THAN EITHER CIRCULATION OR LIBRARY ERROR. ITIS RECOMMENDED THAT FURTHER STUDY BE MADE OF THE EXTENT OF USE OF THE HOLDINGSOF OTHER LIBRARIES, AND OF THE PROPORTION OF USERS WHO COME TO BROWSE ORSEARCH BY SUBJECT RATHER THAN SPECIFIC TITLE, BEFORE CHANGING ACQUISITIONSPOLICY. A SIGNIFICANT PROPORTION OF USER ERROR INDICATES A LACK OF ADEQUATELIBRARY SEARCHING TECHNIQUES, AND IT IS SUGGESTED THAT ASSISTANCE BE PROVIDEDFOR POTENTIAL USERS THROUGH SUCH MEANS AS LIBRARY ORIENTATION PROGRAMMES ANDSIGNS ALERTING THEM TO COMMONLY COMMITTED ERRORS OF THE LOCATION OF SPECIALCOLLECTIONS. REPORT NOT AVAILABL E FROM NTIS.
586|SOME ASPECTS OF THE LIBRARIAN-USER RELATIONSHIP.ARGUES THAT DIRECT LIBRARIAN-USER INTERACTION IS LONG OVERDUE FOR CLOSESCRUTINY, SINCE THIS RELATIONSHIP MAY NOT BE IN HARMONY WITH THE OVERALLSTANDARD OF OTHER SUBSYSTEMS OF THE INFORMATION CENTRE. POINTS OUT THAT, APARTFROM QUALIFICATIONS AND EXPERIENCE, A LIBRARIAN MUST ALSO POSSESS APERSONALITY WHICH IS PSYCHOLOGICALLY WELL BALANCED AND ADAPTABLE, SINCE AGREAT DEAL OF HIS/HER WORK INVOLVES EXPOSURE TO POTENTIALLY STRESSFULSITUATIONS. THESE SITUATIONS ARISE WITH USERS WHO ARE POORLY INFORMED ABOUTTHE PRACTICAL DIFFICULTIES ASSOCIATED WITH OBTAINING A PARTICULAR INFORMATIONSOURCE AND WHO ARE NOT ABLE TO APPRECIATE THAT OTHER READERS HAVE THEIRPRESSING REQUIREMENTS AS WELL. NAME TAGS FOR LIBRARIANS SHOULD LEAD TO GREATERPERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY. IN LARGE LIBRARIES DIRECT USER CONTACT INVOLVES SHIFTWORKING FOR THE PREDOMINANTLY FEMALE STAFF; THIS LEADS TO DIFFICULTIES ANDSOMETIMES LESS THAN ADEQUATE PERSONNEL ARE EXPOSED TO THE PU BLIC. THIS AREAOF LIBRARY SERVICES CRIES OUT FOR A SYSTEMATIC OVERHAUL.
587|CRISIS-CENTRED, ISSUE-BASED' THE LONELINESS OF DISTANCE LEARNING.ARGUES THAT UK LIBRARIES AND THE BRITISH BROADCASTING CORPORATION CONTINUINGEDUCATION HAVE THE SAME STAPLE CUSTOMER GROUP. AS PROVISION OF LOCAL AUTHORITYADULT EDUCATION CLASSES DROPS AND BUDGET CUTS BITE DEEP EVERYWHERE, IT WOULDBENEFIT BOTH ORGANISATIONS TO COOPERATE AND MAINTAIN A 'HIGH PROFILE'. FORTHEIR PART, LIBRARIES SHOULD PRESENT THEMSELVES AS PROVIDERS AND PARTNERS INADULT EDUCATION RATHER THAN AS SERVICING AGENTS; AGGRESSIVELY MARKET MATERIALSASSOCIATED WITH CONTINUING EDUCATION SERIES; AND USE THEIR CLOSENESS TO THECOMMUNITY TO ATTRACT AND SERVE THE WORKING CLASS. WITH ITS 4|,500| OUTLETS, THEUK LIBRARY SYSTEM IS A SLEEPING COMMUNITY EDUCATION GIANT-THE GIANT MUSTAWAKE.

811|A VIEW FROM ZAMBIA.CONTRIBUTION TO A SECTION DEVOTED TO PLANNING INTERLENDING SYSTEMS FORDEVELOPING COUNTRIES. IN ZAMBIA, ACQUISITIONS ARE CENTRALISED, WHICH CAN LEADTO UNSUITABLE SELECTION FOR LOCAL LIBRARIES. THE NATIONAL LIBRARY RECEIVESMOST FUNDS, WHILE OTHER LIBRARIES SUFFER, AND THERE ARE FEW GOOD BOOKSHOPS.INTERLENDING IS FOCUSED ON THE NATIONAL UNIVERSITY LIBRARY, AND ATTEMPTS TOCREATE A NATIONAL UNION CATALOGUE HAVE FAILED SO FAR. DEMAND FOR BOOKS ISHIGH, BUT LIBRARIANS' STATUS IS LOW. INTERLENDING COULD BE BASED ON EXISTINGRESEARCH COLLECTIONS, BUT A CENTRAL COLLECTION OF JOURNALS WOULD BE COSTLY ANDPREMATURE.
812|A VIEW FROM BARBADOS.CONTRIBUTION TO A SECTION DEVOTED TO PLANNING INTERLENDING SYSTEMS FORDEVELOPING COUNTRIES. INTERLENDING IN BARBADOS IS ASSISTED BY THE CLOSEPROXIMITY OF THE MAJOR LIBRARIES, WHICH HAVE GOOD TELEPHONE LINKS.INTERNATIONAL REQUESTS ARE ROUTED VIA THE UNIVERSITY OF WEST INDIES LIBRARY TOTHE BLLD FOR JOURNALS, BUT TO A WIDER SELECTION OF LIBRARIES FOR MONOGRAPHS.THE CHOICE IS DIFFICULT AND TIME-CONSUMING FOR MONOGRAPH REQUESTS, ANDAUTOMATED UNION CATALOGUES PRODUCED IN OTHER COUNTRIES COULD HELP IN THISRESPECT. SMALL COLLECTIONS OF PERIODICALS SATISFY A HIGH PROPORTION OF DEMAND,BUT ACTUAL TITLES REMAIN TO BE IDENTIFIED.
813|SECTION DEVOTED TO PLANNING INTERLENDING SYSTEMS FOR DEVELOPING COUNTRIES).FOR ABSTRACTS OF THE 2| PAPERS IN THIS SECTION (ONE ON BARBADOS, THE OTHER ONZAMBIA), SEE THE FOLLOWING SERIAL NUMBERS:.

ASURVEY OF USER PHOTOCOPYING PRACTICE SUGGESTED THAT CIRCULATION LIMITED TOJOURNALS OVER 5| YEARS OLD MIGHT RESULT IN A 90|% INCREASE IN PHOTOCOPYING, ANDCIRCULATION SURVEY WERE USED TO PREDICT A 45|% DECREASE IN CIRCULATION. RESULTSOF IMPLEMENTING A LIMITED CIRCULATION POLICY WERE A 41|% CIRCULATION DECREASEAND A 136|% INCREASE IN PHOTOCOPYING. DIFFERENCES BETWEEN PREDICTION ANDRESULTS MAY BE ACCOUNTED FOR BY THE EFFECT OF DUPLICATE COPY SUBSCRIPTIONS ANDBY PROVISION OF CONVENIENT PHOTOCOPY FACILITIES.
830|AUTOMATED CIRCULATION SYSTEMS VIS-A-VIS AUTOMATED CATALOGUING.AN AUTOMATED CIRCULATION SYSTEM SHOULD NOT BE DEVELOPED WITHOUT DUE REGARD TOAN EXISTING AUTOMATED CATALOGUING SYSTEM. ABOVE ALL, THERE SHOULD BE THEFACILITY FOR DATA EXCHANGE, TO PRODUCE MACHINE-READABLE BOOK LABELS, AND TOESTABLISH THE NECESSARY FILES WITHOUT DUPLICATION OF DATA. THERE ARE PROBLEMS,HOWEVER, AS CATALOGUE AND LENDING ARE BASED UPON TITLE-ENTRY AND BOOK ASPHYSICAL UNIT RESPECTIVELY, AND FURTHER, THE COMPLEX STRUCTURE OF TITLE-ENTRYAND CALL NUMBER. VARIOUS FUNCTIONS OF THE SYSTEM MAKE IT NECESSARY TO CONNECTDIFFERENT BOOK UNITS ACCORDING TO TITLE ENTRY. A SHORT TITLE IS NECESSARY FOROVERDUE NOTICES.

833|GROUP PROCESSING OF LITERATURE.LARGE LIBRARIES ARE ALWAYS TRYING TO REDUCE THE SIZE OF THEIR CATALOGUES AND,AT THE SAME TIME, TO SIMPLIFY THE RETRIEVAL OF INDIVIDUAL INDEXED ITEMS. THEBULK OF LIBRARY STOCK MUST BE INDEXED INDIVIDUALLY, HOWEVER, THERE IS ACERTAIN TYPE OF LITERATURE, SUCH AS INFORMATION LEAFLETS, PROMOTIONALLITERATURE, WHICH IS SUITABLE FOR GROUP PROCESSING (1| CATALOGUE CARD IS USEDFOR A SERIES OF ITEMS FOR EXAMPLE). THE MAIN LIBRARY OF LENINGRAD POLYTECHNICPREPARED 'INSTRUCTIONS FOR GROUP PROCESSING OF INFORMATION LITERATURE' IN1977|. THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THESE INSTRUCTIONS IS DISCUSSED. IT IS SHOWN THATGROUP PROCESSING OF CERTAIN TYPES OF LITERATURE CAN CONSIDERABLY INCREASE THEEFFECTIVENESS OF CATALOGUING, DECREASE LABOUR CONSUMPTION AND REDUCE THE SIZEOF LIBRARY CATALOGUES.

THEMAIN POINTS ARE THE GENERAL AND SPECIFIC CRITICISMS OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS PUTFORWARD BY THE GERMAN RESEARCH SOCIETY, AND THE FUNCTION, PERFORMANCE ANDCOSTS OF A NATIONAL COOPERATIVE SYSTEM COMPARED WITH 7| INDEPENDENT REGIONALCATALOGUING SYSTEMS. IT IS CONCLUDED THAT WHILE A NATIONAL SYSTEM WOULD OFFERMANY TECHNICAL AND BIBLIOGRAPHICAL ADVANTAGES, THERE IS NO NATIONAL CONSENSUSFOR ITS ESTABLISHMENT.
838|BIBLIOGRAPHICAL CONTROL OF SPECIAL LIBRARIES' AN AUTOMATION APPROACH TOCLASSIFICATION AND CATALOGUING.TAKES AS A CONCEPTUAL PERSPECTIVE THE USE OF DATA PROCESSING TECHNIQUES TOREPLACE TRADITIONAL PRACTICES OF CLASSIFICATION AND CATALOGUING. ALL ENTRIESWILL BE MAIN ENTRIES SO AS TO PROVIDE MULTI-ACCESS POINTS TO BIBLIOGRAPHICALINFORMATION.

846|SAP-A NEW WAY TO PRODUCE SUBJECT DESCRIPTIONS.WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THE SUBJECT ACCESS PROJECT (SAP), AT LUND UNIVERSITYLIBRARY, SWEDEN, A NEW VERSION OF ON-LINE CATALOGUE FOR MONOGRAPHS HAS BEENDEVELOPED. USING THE SAP-INDEXING METHOD, EXISTING BIBLIOGRAPHIC CATALOGUERECORDS HAVE BEEN ENRICHED WITH SELECTED TERMS FROM CONTENTS TABLES AND BOOKINDEXES. THE IDEA OF SAP IS TO PRODUCE SUBJECT DESCRIPTIONS OF BOOKS TAKENFROM THE BOOKS THEMSELVES AND TO MAKE MORE USE OF A PUBLICATION'S 'INHERENT'ATTRIBUTES. IT IS ALSO AN APPROACH TO THE SHORTCOMINGS OF CLASSIFICATIONSYSTEMS IN DESCRIBING A BOOK'S CONTENTS BY MEANS OF A LIMITED NUMBER OFCLASSIFICATION CODES. BY SAP, LOW COST RETRIEVAL CAPABILITIES ARE PROVIDED FORMONOGRAPH USERS.

1302|LIBRARY LITERACY: WHO? WHEN? WHERE?.THE PROBLEM OF INADEQUATE LIBRARY EDUCATION IN PRIMARY AND SECONDARY SCHOOLSHAS FAR-REACHING RESULTS. ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS MUST TEACH STUDENTS THE BASICSOF LIBRARY USE BEFORE EMBARKING ON COURSE-RELATED INSTRUCTION-ALL IN A VERYSHORT TIME AND WITH REDUCED SUCCESS. SCHOOL LEAVERS WHO GO DIRECTLY INTO THEWORK FORCE-THE VERY PEOPLE WHO MOST NEED AND COULD BEST PROFIT FROMLIBRARIES-WILL NEVER HAVE EFFECTIVE LIBRARY ACCESS. THIS MAKES THE LIVES OFMANY POORER AND MORE DIFFICULT; DENIES THEM SOME MEASURE OF SATISFACTION,SUCCESS, AND HAPPINESS; AND ERODES SOCIETY'S ABILITY TO DEAL WITH CRITICALPROBLEMS AND GOVERN ITSELF.

1314|THE ACCURACY OF TELEPHONE REFERENCE SERVICES IN THE SOUTHEAST' A CASE FORQUANTITATIVE STANDARDS.THE TELEPHONE REFERENCE SERVICES OF PUBLIC AND PRIVATE COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITYLIBRARIES IN THE 9| SOUTHEASTERN STATES OF THE USA WERE INVESTIGATED USINGTHEIR RESPONSES TO 12| FACT-SEEKING TELEPHONE QUERIES MADE OVER A 12|-MONTHPERIOD, THEIR 1975| LIBRARY GENERAL INFORMATION SURVEY DATA, AND AQUESTIONNAIRE DESIGNED TO IDENTIFY INDEPENDENT VARIABLES RELATED TO REFERENCESERVICES. ONLY 50|% OF THE TEST QUESTIONS WERE ANSWERED CORRECTLY. INDEPENDENTVARIABLES SUCH AS SERVICE HOURS OR VOLUMES HELD WERE MORE CLOSELY RELATED TOACCURACY OF RESPONSE THAN VARIABLES CONCERNED WITH STAFF, INDICATING THATSTAFF ABILITY TO EXPLOIT A COLLECTION IS MORE CRUCIAL THAN STAFF NUMBERS.CONCLUDES THAT THESE RESULTS SUPPORT CALLS FOR QUANTITATIVE STANDARDS FORREFERENCE SERVICES.
1315|MEASUREMENT OF REFERENCE TRANSACTIONS' AN IN-DEPTH STATISTICAL STUDY OF DEMANDAND CAPACITY IN TWENTY-TWO LIBRARIES OVER A TWO-YEAR PERIOD.DESCRIBES A STUDY OF THE VOLUME OF REFERENCE TRANSACTIONS IN OHIO STATEUNIVERSITY LIBRARY SYSTEM'S DEPARTMENT LIBRARIES IN 1977| AND 1978|. DISCUSSESTHE RESULTS AND CONCLUDES THAT IT IS POSSIBLE TO PREDICT THE VOLUME OFREFERENCE QUESTIONS WITH SOME ACCURACY AND THAT MEANINGFUL INTERPRETATION OFTHE TOTALS CAN BE MADE.
1316|REFERENCE UPDATE. HOW OLD IS IT AND HOW MUCH IS IT WORTH?.IT HAS BEEN ESTIMATED THAT THE USA HAS 22| MILLION 'COLLECTORS OF ONE KIND ORANOTHER, MOSTLY ANOTHER'. ALL WANT TO FIND A FORTUNE IN THEIR ATTIC AND,SOONER OR LATER, MOST COME TO THE LIBRARY TO PROVE THE AUTHENTICITY OF THEIRTREASURE. SUGGESTS SEVERAL PUBLICATIONS AND SERVICES WHICH THE LIBRARIAN CANCONSULT TO DISCOVER THE AGE AND VALUE OF THE COLLECTIONS.
1317|MANAGERIAL RATING' A LIBRARY EFFECTIVENESS MODEL.IN NOV 71|, AN AD-HOC COMMITTEE OF LIBRARIANS AT WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITYWAS ASKED TO DETERMINE IF EFFECTIVENESS MEASURES COULD BE APPLIED TO REFERENCEACTIVITIES AND, IF SO, TO PROPOSE SOME METHOD FOR COLLECTING THE NECESSARYDATA. SEVERAL EFFECTIVENESS MODELS WERE STUDIED AND DISCARDED. THE COMMITTEETHEN TRIED THE MANAGERIAL RATING MODEL, WHEREBY MANAGERS MEET TO IDENTIFYGOALS AND OBJECTIVES, THEN RECONVENE AFTER A GIVEN TIME TO RATE THEIR LEVELSOF ACCOMPLISHMENT. A TRIAL INDICATED THAT THIS MODEL WAS SUITABLE AND THECOMMITTEE REPORTED ACCORDINGLY, BUT NO FULL TRIAL EVER TOOK PLACE AND THECOMMITTEE WAS DISBANDED. SUGGESTS THAT THIS WAS DUE TO THE METHOD'S POSSIBLEDISADVANTAGES AND A LACK OF INTEREST.
1318|ANALYZING THE AVAILABILITY OF REFERENCE SERVICES.THE KEY TO THE OBJECTIVE BRANCHING ANALYSIS OF REFERENCE SERVICES IS THEIDENTIFICATION OF A CHAIN OF ESSENTIALLY INDEPENDENT CONDITIONS WHICH MUST BEMET FOR A PATRON TO OBTAIN THE SERVICE REQUIRED. EXPLORES THE PROBLEMSINVOLVED IN SUCH IDENTIFICATION, ILLUSTRATING EACH PROBLEM WITH DATA COLLECTEDFROM 16| LIBRARIES IN THE LORCOST PROJECT (LEVELS OF OUTPUT RELATED TO COSTS OFOPERATION OF SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL LIBRARIES, A 2|-YEAR STUDY TO COLLECTPRIMARY INFORMATION FROM 50| SUCH LIBRARIES) WHICH ELECTED TO COLLECT DATA ONREFERENCE SERVICE AVAILABILITY.
1319|MEASUREMENT OF REFERENCE SERVICE' REFERENCE STATISTICS 1978|/79|' UNIVERSITYLIBRARY, UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN.THE TYPES OF STATISTICS NEEDED FOR THE ADMINISTRATION OF A REFERENCE PROGRAMMEIN AN ACADEMIC LIBRARY WERE INVESTIGATED BY COLLECTING DATA ON VARIABLES SUCHAS PEAK TIMES OF HEAVIST REFERENCE USE, TYPE OF REFERENCE QUESTIONS, TIMESPENT IN ANSWERING QUESTIONS, TYPE OF EMPLOYEE ANSWERING QUESTIONS, ADEQUACYOF RESPONSES, REASONS FOR INADEQUATE ANSWERS, AND WHETHER PROFESSIONAL STAFFWERE ANSWERING THE MORE SOPHISTICATED QUESTIONS. ANALYSIS OF THE DATAINDICATED THAT SUCH INFORMATION COULD BE USED FOR THE ADMINISTRATION OF ANACADEMIC LIBRARY REFERENCE SERVICE AND THAT A STANDARDISED DATA FORM COULD BEUSED FOR BOTH GENERAL REFERENCE SERVICE AND REFERENCE SERVICE IN A SPECIALISEDSUBJECT AREA.
1320|TEST STUDIES OF THE REFERENCE SERVICES OF GERMAN PUBLIC LIBRARIES.IN AUTUMN 79| A STUDY OF REFERENCE SERVICES IN GERMAN PUBLIC LIBRARIES WASCARRIED OUT. A RESEARCHER POSED AS A LIBRARY USER AT SELECTED LIBRARIES ANDANSWERS HE RECEIVED TO REFERENCE QUERIES WERE THEN EVALUATED FORCOMPREHENSIVENESS AND ACCURACY. THE AIM OF THE STUDY WAS NOT TO ASSESS THEQUALITY OF PUBLIC LIBRARY REFERENCE SERVICES OR TO SINGLE OUT INDIVIDUALLIBRARIES; INSTEAD IT DEMONSTRATES A NEW METHODOLOGY WHICH CAN PRODUCE DATABEYOND THE MERELY QUANTITATIVE DATA WHICH PREVIOUSLY COULD BE INTERPRETED, FORTHE MOST PART, FROM LIBRARY STATISTICS.
1321|DOCUMENT DELIVERY: A BIBLIOGRAPHICAL SURVEY.THE TERM DOCUMENT DELIVERY ENCOMPASSES VARIOUS FORMS OF PROVIDING PRIMARYDOCUMENTS WHICH HAVE ALREADY BEEN PROCESSED IN BIBLIOGRAPHIES AND BY SDISERVICES. DOCUMENT DELIVERY SERVICES NOTIFY THE USERS OF THE POSSIBILITIES OFOBTAINING THE PRIMARY SOURCES IN THE FORM OF PHOTOCOPIES OF PERIODICALARTICLES AND BY INTERLIBRARY LOANS IN THE CASE OF BOOKS. FROM 19| REFERENCES TOLITERATURE DEALING WITH THIS FORM OF DISSEMINATION OF INFORMATION, 5| ARE OFCZECH ORIGIN, THE REST DRAWING ATTENTION TO THE 'UNIVERSAL AVAILABILITY OFPUBLICATIONS' PROGRAMME AND SYSTEMS SUCH AS 'THE MAIL DROP' SERVICES AND'ORIGINAL ARTICLE TEAR SHEET'. PAPERS BY AUTHORS SUCH AS P.D. GILLESPIE, M.B.LINE AND F.W. LANCASTER ARE CITED.
1322|AVAILABILITY OF MATERIALS IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES.DESCRIBES A METHOD DEVELOPED AT THE PRINCE WILLIAM PUBLIC LIBRARY, MANASSAS,VIRGINIA, FOR MEASURING THE RATE OF AVAILABILITY OF MATERIALS SOUGHT BY THEPUBLIC FROM ITS COLLECTIONS. RELATES THIS METHOD TO TRADITIONAL PUBLIC LIBRARYSTANDARDS AND PREVIOUS AVAILABILITY RESEARCH. AVAILABILITY RATE COULD BE USEDAS A PERFORMANCE STANDARD, MEASURING QUALITY OF SERVICE DELIVERED ANDINDICATING A LIBRARY'S STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES.
1323|LONGITUDINAL STUDIES OF BOOK AVAILABILITY.REVIEWS 6| EXPERIMENTAL STUDIES OF BOOK AVAILABILITY CONDUCTED AT THE 2| MAJORLIBRARIES OF CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY, OHIO-THE SEARS LIBRARY (PHYSICALAND BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES, ENGINEERING, MANAGEMENT, AND ECONOMICS) AND THEFREIBERGER LIBRARY (SOCIAL AND BEHAVIOURAL SCIENCES AND THE HUMANITIES). THESTUDIES SHOW HOW CERTAIN MANAGEMENT DECISIONS HAVE INFLUENCED BOOKAVAILABILITY IN THESE LIBRARIES AND HOW CERTAIN OTHER EVENTS, OVER WHICHMANAGEMENT HAD LITTLE CONTROL, HAVE COMPROMISED EFFORTS TO IMPROVE BOOKAVAILABILITY.
1324|BIBLIOGRAPHIC RETRIEVAL VERSUS AVAILABILITY OF DOCUMENTS' THE PROBLEM OFSELECTION.LIBRARIANS ARE CONSTANTLY FACED WITH THE TASK OF SUPPLYING LITERATURE ONRAPIDLY DEVELOPING SUBJECTS, ESPECIALLY IN TECHNOLOGY AND MEDICINE. MECHANICALINFORMATION RETRIEVAL IS APT TO YIELD VAST AMOUNTS OF REFERENCES WHICH HAVE TOBE WEEDED OUT. CRITERIA FOR THIS VARY, BUT ARE USUALLY DICTATED BY NECESSITY,NAMELY THE ACTUAL AVAILABILITY OF DOCUMENTS. THUS THE USER CAN READILY BESUPPLIED WITH THE RELEVANT LITERATURE IN WELL KNOWN JOURNALS STOCKED BY THELIBRARY. IT IS QUESTIONABLE WHETHER THE USER GETS A GOOD COVERAGE INITIALLY,OR WHETHER HE MUST INSIST ON TOTAL RETRIEVAL OF DOCUMENTS. THE PROBLEM OFSELECTION WILL PROBABLY BECOME MORE ACUTE IN THE FUTURE. A POSSIBLE SOLUTIONIS TO ANALYSE THE GROWTH AND SPREAD OF PAPERS RELEVANT TO A SPECIFIC TOPIC INBROADER BASED JOURNALS.
1325|PROGRAMMING WITH A PURPOSE.EXAMINES THE RATIONALE FOR LIBRARY-SPONSORED PROGRAMMES AND CONTENDS THATLIBRARIES MUST ENSURE THAT THESE PROGRAMMES ARE PLANNED AND PURSUED IN TERMSOF A SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE AND THAT THEY GIVE SUFFICIENT RETURN FOR THE TIME ANDEFFORT INVESTED. THIS IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT IN THE FACE OF SHRINKINGBUDGETS AND REDUCED STAFF. (PAPER REPRINTED FROM 2|LIBRARY PR NEWS1|, 1979|).
1326|CULTURE IN HEDEMORA-A CHALLENGE.DESCRIBES THE CULTURAL LIFE OF A SMALL LOCAL AUTHORITY, HEDEMORA (SWEDEN).REMARKS ON THE CONCEPT OF CULTURE AS OUTLINED IN THE OFFICIAL PROGRAMME, WHERETHE DREAMS ARE PUT FORWARD, AND WARNS AGAINST EXPANDING IT INTO ABSURDITY.DIVIDES THE CONCEPT INTO' POPULAR AND AMATEUR CULTURE, NURTURED BY SOCIETIESAND STUDY CIRCLES AND EXEMPLIFIED BY BIENNIAL ART EXHIBITIONS, AN ANTHOLOGY OFPOEMS, CRAFT DEMONSTRATIONS AND MUSICAL EVENTS DURING THE SUMMER; HIGHCULTURE, AS REPRESENTED BY THE DRAMA, ART AND CHAMBER MUSIC SOCIETIES AND THELIBRARY WHICH AIM TO PRESERVE THE CULTURAL HERITAGE; AND CHILDREN'S CULTURE.THIS ASPECT IS NEGLECTED AS THE LIBRARY HAS A POOR CHILDREN'S SECTION AND NOCHILDREN'S LIBRARIAN.
1327|CHILDREN'S LIBRARY ACTIVITIES (IN ARABIC).LIBRARY ACTIVITIES AIM TO ENCOURAGE AND ENLIVEN LIBRARY USE. READINGS ANDTALKS HAVE BECOME AN INTEGRAL PART OF CHILDREN'S LIBRARY SERVICE, AND OTHERACTIVITIES INCLUDE STORY HOURS, DRAMA, QUIZZES, COMPETITIONS AND READINGPROGRAMMES. THESE MOTIVATE READING AND ORIENTATE CHILDREN WITHIN THE LIBRARY.NON-BOOK MATERIALS CAN ALSO BE A MEANS TO ACHIEVE THE OBJECTIVES OF LIBRARYACTIVITIES.
1328|SERIALS DEPARTMENTS' DOOMED TO EXTINCTION?.BECAUSE TASKS AND MATERIALS RELATED TO SERIALS PROCESSING AND USE ARE OFTENDISPERSED IN A LIBRARY, SERIALS SPECIALISTS MUST DEVELOP PERSONAL INFLUENCESTRATEGIES AND USE INFORMAL COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS WHICH CROSS ORGANISATIONALBOUNDARIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A SERIALS DEPARTMENT, SERIALS SPECIALISTS ANDINFORMAL SERIALS COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS WILL CONTINUE TO EXIST. IT IS WIDELYAGREED THAT INFORMAL COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS EMERGE SPONTANEOUSLY INORGANISATIONS AND INDIVIDUALS WITH NO FORMALLY CONFERRED AUTHORITY MAY USEVARIOUS TYPES OF PERSONAL INFLUENCE STRATEGIES TO ACHIEVE ORGANISATIONALOBJECTIVES. WHILE SERIALS PROCESSING AND PUBLIC SERVICE COULD BE MOSTEFFICIENTLY HANDLED THROUGH A SERIALS DEPARTMENT, INFORMAL COMMUNICATIONSYSTEMS, UTILISED BY SERIALS SPECIALISTS, WILL DEVELOP IF SUCH A DEPARTMENTDOES NOT EXIST. IN DETERMINING IF A SERIALS DEPARTMENT HAS A PLACE IN APARTICULAR LIBRARY ORGANISATION, LIBRARY PLANNERS SHOULD BE CONCERNED A BOUTNATURAL COMMUNICATION CHANNELS AND SHOULD TRY TO IDENTIFY INDIVIDUALS WHO CANCOMMUNICATE EFFECTIVELY ACROSS ORGANISATIONAL BARRIERS.
1329|ADLIB FOR LIBRARY MANAGEMENT.LMR INFORMATION SYSTEMS, MAIDENHEAD, ARE RAPIDLY DEVELOPING THEIR SOFTWAREPACKAGE ADLIB (ADAPTIVE LIBRARY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM), A TOOL FOR STORING ANDMANIPULATING BIBLIOGRAPHIC INFORMATION WITH A VARIED SELECTION OF MODULESAVAILABLE FOR PERFORMING DIFFERENT OPERATIONS. PRESENTS A BROAD DESCRIPTION OFTHE TYPES OF OPERATION WHICH CAN BE CARRIED OUT. THE 2| BASIC FUNCTIONS OFADLIB ARE THE CATALOGUING AND RETIREVAL MODULES AND THE SYSTEM CAN BE BUILT UPFROM THERE BY THE INDIVIDUAL LIBRARY USING ANY COMBINATION OF THE FOLLOWING'CONTROLLED LANGUAGE AND AUTHORITY LIST FILES, THESAURUS MANAGEMENT MODULE,CIRCULATION CONTROL MODULE, ORDER MODULE, WORD PROCESSING MODULE AND MARC TAPEPROCESSOR.
1330|WILTSHIRE LIBRARY AND MUSEUM SERVICE' AN INTEGRATED SYSTEM.DISCUSSES THE PROGRESS MADE BY WILTSHIRE'S LIBRARY AND MUSEUM SERVICE INAUTOMATING ITS CATALOGUING AND CIRCULATION SYSTEM. THE SERVICE REJECTED MARCRECORDS AND CREATED ITS OWN PROGRAMMES AND FILES. RETROSPECTIVE CATALOGUECONVERSION HAS BEEN CARRIED OUT. THE CIRCULATION SYSTEM COMPRISES A PLESSEYSATELLITE AND OPERATES IN BATCH MODE AT THE COUNTY'S 6| BUSIEST BRANCHES EACHOF WHICH HAS AT LEAST 1| ISSUE, DISCHARGE AND COMPOSITE TERMINAL.

1332|NORTH YORKSHIRE LIBRARY ON-LINE SYSTEM.NORTH YORKSHIRE COUNTY COUNCIL, FORMED IN THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT REORGANISATIONIN 1974|, IS AN AMALGAMATION OF ALL OR PART OF 7| FORMERLY INDEPENDANT LIBRARYSERVICES. IT WAS ESSENTIAL TO STANDARDISE THEIR WORK METHODS SO AUTOMATION WASINTRODUCED AT THE TIME OF REORGANISATION. THE AIM OF THE AUTOMATION WAS TOPROVIDE A CENTRAL CONTROL OF THE NORTH YORKSHIRE LIBRARY BOOKSTOCK AND TOPRODUCE A CATALOGUE OF THE COUNTY STOCK. IT WAS DECIDED TO USE THE BRITISHLIBRARY MARC RECORDS AS THE BASIS FOR THE CATALOGUE INFORMATION. DESCRIBES THEINSTALLATION OF AN ICL 1904|S COMPUTER IN 1976| FOLLOWED BY AN ICL 2976| IN 1979|AND TIMETABLES THE MAJOR EVENTS OF THE AUTOMATION PROCESS FROM 1976|/80|.
1333|DESIGN PRINCIPLES FOR A COMPREHENSIVE LIBRARY SYSTEM.DESCRIBES A PROJECT WHICH TAKES A STEP-BY-STEP OR INCREMENTAL APPROACH TO THEDEVELOPMENT OF AN ON-LINE COMPREHENSIVE SYSTEM RUNNING ON A DEDICATEDCOMPUTER. THE DESIGN SUGGESTED PAYS PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO PRESENT ANDPREDICTED CAPABILITIES IN COMPUTING AS WELL AS TO TRENDS IN LIBRARYAUTOMATION. THE RESULTANT SYSTEM IS NOW IN ITS 2|ND OF 3| RELEASES, HAVING TIEDTOGETHER CIRCULATION CONTROL, CATALOGUE ACCESS AND SERIAL HOLDINGS.
1334|STATE-OF-THE-ART REPORT' DATA INPUT FOR LIBRARIES.REPORT PRODUCED TO PROVIDE PRESENT AND POTENTIAL INFORONICS CUSTOMERS WITH ANOVERVIEW OF TECHNIQUES OF DATA INPUT (FOR CATALOGUING, BIBLIOGRAPHY,INFORMATION AND REFERENCE WORK). EACH PROCEDURE IS DESCRIBED AND AN ESTIMATEOF PROCESSING COSTS IS GIVEN. A FINAL SECTION DEALS WITH SPECIAL PROCEDURESFOR ENCODING BACKLOGS OF DATA WHEN CONVERTING A LARGE DATA FILE TO AMECHANISED SYSTEM.
1335|SERIAL CONTROL IN A DEVELOPED MACHINE SYSTEM.ARGUES THAT THE DEVELOPED MACHINE SYSTEMS OF THE FUTURE WILL NOT BE BASED ONPRESENT LINEAR MACHINE RECORDS, BUT WILL OPERATE UPON A COMPLEX NETWORK OFSIMPLE RECORDS. SUCH A NETWORK WILL HAVE SPECIAL APPLICATION TO THE PROBLEMSRELATING TO THE CONTROL OF BIBLIOGRAPHIC INFORMATION ON SERIALS. THE PROBLEMSOF CHRONOLOGICAL AND HIERARCHICAL LINKAGE OF SERIALS ARE ANALYSED AND RELATEDTO THE PROPOSED NEW SYSTEM. THE PROPOSED SYSTEM WILL ALSO PROVIDE BENEFICIALEFFECTS FOR SERIALS CHECK IN, SERIALS CATALOGUING, AND CATALOGUE USERS.
1336|THE METHODS AND PROBLEMS OF ACQUISITION IN THE RESEARCH LIBRARIES.A TALK GIVEN IN CONNECTION WITH THE 14|TH NORDIC LIBRARY MEETING. EXAMINES THELITERATURE AVAILABLE ON THE SUBJECT OF ACQUISITION. MUCH OF THIS RESULTS FROMSEMINARS AND CONFERENCES. 1| OF THE PROBLEMS ARISING IN THE AREA OF ACQUISITIONIS UNWANTED DUPLICATES. DOUBLE ACQUISITION MAY BE CAUSED BY MONOGRAPHS WHICHHAVE ALREADY BEEN ORDERED AS PART OF A SERIES. CHOICE OF BOOKSELLER IS ALSOCRUCIAL. OTHER PROBLEMS CONCERN CALCULATION OF PRICE INCREASES AND THE USE OFEXCHANGES. THE MECHANISATION OF ROUTINES, SUCH AS CATALOGUING AND ACCOUNTINGAND THE AUTOMATION OF BOOKSELLERS' DATA HAVE CONSEQUENCES FOR ACQUISITION. NEWTENDENCIES IN PUBLISHING, SUCH AS EXCLUSIVE PUBLICATION IN MICROFORM, CANCAUSE PROBLEMS OF CONTROL AND RETRIEVAL. THE PROBLEMS SURROUNDING PHOTOCOPYINGAND LENDING VERSUS PURCHASE ARE STILL BEING DEBATED.
1337|CLAIMING' LUXURY OR NECESSITY?.CLAIMING OF ORDERS IS A TIME-CONSUMING PROCEDURE WHICH IS THOUGHT TO BENECESSARY IN THE ACQUISITIONS PROCESS. EXAMINES THE CURRENT LITERATURERELATING TO CLAIMING, AND THEN CONCENTRATES ON SOME SPECIFIC ASPECTS OF THECLAIMING PROCESS, FOCUSING ON CLAIMS FOR MONOGRAPHS, NOT SERIALS.

A RANDOM SAMPLEOF BOOKS ACQUIRED IN 2| YEARS' TIME AT THE UNIVERSITY OF PORT HARCOURT LIBRARYIN NIGERIA IS TAKEN FOR THE PURPOSE OF DETERMINING THE MAIN GENERATORS OF NEWTITLES FOR THE LIBRARY'S COLLECTION. CIRCULATION RECORDS OF THE BOOKS ARETRACED, AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR BUILDING A WORKING COLLECTION MOST EFFECTIVELYARE MADE.
1340|TOPOGRAPHIC MAP ACQUISITION IN US ACADEMIC LIBRARIES.PRESENTS THE RESULTS OF A RECENT SURVEY OF TOPOGRAPHICAL MAP ACQUISITION IN USACADEMIC LIBRARIES, AND DISCUSSES THE STATUS OF, AND TRENDS IN, TOPOGRAPHICALMAP ACQUISITION PROGRAMMES. CONCLUDES THAT THE LEVEL OF ACQUISITION OF THISMAPPING IS REMARKABLY LOW COMPARED TO THE STATED DEMAND FOR IT, AND THAT THESITUATION REGARDING FOREIGN MATERIAL IS ESPECIALLY CRITICAL. IDENTIFIES THEMAJOR COLLECTING PROBLEMS AS' LOSS OF DEPOSITORY RECEIPTS; INADEQUATE FUNDINGSUPPORT; INFLATED MAP PRICES; INCREASED PRODUCTION; AND GOVERNMENTRESTRICTIONS. SUGGESTS THAT THESE PROBLEMS COULD BE RESOLVED BY OBTAININGBETTER INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL SUPPORT THROUGH PLANNING, ORGANISED ACTION, ANDCOOPERATIVE EFFORTS, AND HIGHLIGHTS THE NEED FOR LIBRARY ADMINISTRATORS TORECOGNISE THE RESOURCE VALUE OF TOPOGRAPHIC MAPPING.
1341|A RATIONALIST'S CRITIQUE OF BOOK SELECTION FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIES.ACADEMIC LIBRARY COLLECTIONS HAVE, HISTORICALLY, BEEN SELECTED BY THE FACULTYOF THE INSTITUTION WHICH THEY LIBRARY SERVES. RECENTLY, HOWEVER, MUCHRESPONSIBILITY FOR COLLECTION DEVELOPMENT HAS DEVOLVED UPON LIBRARIANS WHO AREEAGER TO RETAIN AND AMPLIFY THEIR ROLE IN THIS AREA. ARGUMENTS PRESENTED INFAVOUR OF LODGING COLLECTION DEVELOPMENT RESPONSIBLITY WITH LIBRARIANS ARE,HOWEVER, LESS THAN CONVINCING AND IGNORE IMPORTANT REALITIES TO MAKE THEIRCASE. LIBRARIANS OFTEN CONFUSE THE ABILITY TO SELECT BOOKS WITH ACCOUNTABILITYFOR SUCH SELECTION. ARGUES THAT BOOK SELECTION IS MORE PROPERLY AND MOREADEQUATELY DONE BY FACULTY MEMBERS THAN LIBRARIANS, AND SUGGESTS A WAY OFDEALING WITH THE PROBLEM OF ACCOUNTABILITY OFTEN ENCOUNTERED WHEN FACULTY ARERESPONSIBLE FOR SELECTION.
1342|TOWARD A COMPREHENSIVE COLLECTION DEVELOPMENT POLICY FOR PARTIAL U.S.DEPOSITORY LIBRARIES.LIBRARY LITERATURE HAS LONG IGNORED THE PROBLEM OF COLLECTION DEVELOPMENT FORU.S. GOVERNMENT PUBLICATIONS. REGIONAL DEPOSITORIES ARE NOT ADVERSELY AFFECTEDBY THIS OVERSIGHT. HOWEVER, THE PARTIAL DEPOSITORY LIBRARY SUFFERS THECONSEQUENCES. OFTEN IN THE PAST, THE SOLE CRITERION FOR THE BUILDING OF APARTIAL DEPISITORY COLLECTION HAS BEEN ACCRETION WITHOUT REGARD FOR OTHERSALIENT FACTORS. AT PRESENT AND IN THE FORESEABLE FUTURE, FISCAL EXIGENCY WILLCAUSE INCREASING DEMANDS TO BE MADE ON THE LIBRARY'S BUDGET AND SPACE. INORDER TO MAKE JUDICIOUS DECISIONS WHICH WILL PERMIT THE DEPOTISORY COLLECTIONTO GROW IN A MANNER RESPONSIVE TO ITS OWN NEEDS, AS WELL AS TO VARIOUSCURRICULAR AND COMMUNITY NEEDS, A FRAMEWORK OF POLICY MUST EXIST. IT IS INTHIS CONTEXT THAT A POLICY STATEMENT IS PRESENTED.

IT WAS FOUND THAT 74|.5|% WOULDOPPOSE THE CREATION OF A NEW LOWER STANDARD. DESPITE THE POSSIBILITY OF EXTRAREQUIREMENTS TO UPGRADE AN EARLIER CATALOGUE RECORD TO MEET CURRENT STANDARDS,LIBRARIANS, IN GENERAL, SHOWED A STRONG COMMITMENT TOWARD QUALITY ANDCOMPLIANCE WITH CURRENT STANDARDS.
1380|PATTERNS IN THE USE OF OCLC BY ACADEMIC LIBRARY CATALOGING DEPARTMENTS.A SURVEY OF THE CATALOGUING DEPARTMENTS OF 166| OCLC-MEMBER ACADEMIC LIBRARIESSHOWED THAT LIBRARIES DID NOT RELY EXCLUSIVELY ON OCLC FOR CARD PRODUCTION ANDTHAT A LARGE MAJORITY DID NOT ACCEPT NON-LIBRARY OF CONGRESS OCLC RECORDSWITHOUT SUBSTANTIAL CHECKING. THE SURVEY INDICATED ALSO THAT LIBRARIES THATUSED OR PLANNED TO USE THEIR OCLC-MARC TAPES GENERALLY WERE MORE CONCERNEDWITH THE COMPLETENESS AND ACCURACY OF THEIR OCLC-MARC TAPE RECORDS THANLIBRARIES THAT DID NOT PLAN TO USE THEIR TAPES.
1381|EXPERIMENTAL ON LINE CATALOG FOR THE DARTMOUTH COLLEGE LIBRARIES.THIS ON-LINE PILOT PROJECT DEMONSTRATES THE FEASIBILITY OF USING THE OCLCTRANSACTION TAPES TO CREATE AN ON-LINE CATALOGUE, AND THE UTILITY OF THE BRSDATA BASE STRUCTURE FOR LOADING THIS DATA AND FOR ON-LINE SEARCHING. REPORTNOT AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
1382|THE SYSTEM IS THE SOLUTION' AN APPROACH TO INCREASED TECHNICAL SERVICESPRODUCTIVITY.IN 1978|, ONTARIO'S UNIVERSITY OF WATERLOO DISCOVERED A BACKLOG OF BOOKS IN ITSCATALOGUING DEPARTMENT AFTER A CATALOGUING REVISION AND THE IMPLEMENTATION OFFULL MARC CODING. A NEW APPROACH TO COPING WITH THE BACKLOG PROVED VERYSUCCESSFUL.

AN IN-DEPTH DISCUSSION OF ONE QUALITATIVEAPPROACH-ETHNOGRAPHY. ITS DISTINCTIVE CHARACTER DERIVES FROM ITS UNDERLYINGMETHODOLOGICAL PRINCIPLES-A CONCERN WITH THE DISCOVERY, GENERATION, ANDDEVELOPMENT, AS WELL AS TESTING, OF THEORY; A COMMITMENT TO LEARNING THECULTURE OF THOSE BEING STUDIED; AND A RECOGNITION OF THE IMPORTANCE OFCONTEXT. AGAINST THIS BACKGROUND, OUTLINES SOME ETHNOGRAPHICALTECHNIQUES-GROUNDED THEORISING (THEORETICAL SAMPLING AND THE CONSTANTCOMPARATIVE METHOD) AND TESTING THEORY (TRIANGULATION AND ANALYTIC INDUCTION).STRESSES THAT THIS IS A RESEARCH TRADITION STILL IN THE THROES OF DEVELOPMENT.

THE CLEAR-CUTDISTINCTIONS ORIGINALLY ENVISAGED FOR THE INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL COMPONENTS OFTHE EVALUATION BECAME BLURRED AND THERE WAS CONFLICT BETWEEN PRESSURES FOR ATRADITIONAL, TIGHTLY-CONTROLLED EVALUATION AND THE RESEARCHERS' PREFERENCE FORA MORE EXPLANATORY EVALUATION STRATEGY. ILLUMINATIVE EVALUATION WAS USED; THISESCHEWS PRE- AND POST-TESTING IN FAVOUR OF A WIDE-RANGING STUDY OF THECONTEXTUAL DETERMINANTS OF A VENTURE'S SUCCESS.

1823|THE ACM PERIODICAL BANK' A RETROSPECTIVE VIEW.     EVALUATION OF A COOPERATIVE VENTURE PLANNED AND CARRIED OUT IN THE LATE 60|SAND 70|S BY 10| MID-WEST LIBERAL ART COLLEGES. THEIR LIBRARY SERVICE AND CENTRALPERIODICAL BANK WORKED WELL UNTIL IT WAS COOPTED BY THE TAX-SUPPORTED SYSTEMSIN MINNESOTA AND LATER SOLD TO THE ILLINOIS NORTH SUBURBAN LIBRARY SYSTEM,WHICH SERVES A MUCH LARGER CLIENTELE AND COULD THUS PROVIDE ECONOMIES OF SCALEBASED ON HIGH-VOLUME BORROWING AND LARGE COLLECTIONS.
1824|AUTOMATED ACQUISITIONS SYSTEMS' KEYNOTE ADDRESS.     CONTRIBUTION TO THE LITA (AMERICAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION. LIBRARY ANDINFORMATION TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION) INSTITUTE. LIBRARIANS SHOULD BE AWARE OFTHE RAPID PROGRESS BEING MADE TOWARD INTEGRATED SYSTEMS AND MAKE THEACQUISITIONS AUTOMATION DECISION IN THAT LIGHT. CONTRASTS THE MID-60|S ANDEARLY 80|S IN TERMS OF TECHNOLOGY AND LIBRARY NEEDS. IN THE MID-60|S, EMPHASISWAS ON ORDERING, AND TECHNOLOGY WAS LIMITING BOTH IN TERMS OF COSTS ANDCAPABILITIES. AT THE BEGINNING OF THE 80|S LIBRARIES HAVE NUMEROUS ACQUISITIONSAVAILABLE, INCLUDING TURNKEY SYSTEMS FROM SOME CIRCULATION SYSTEM VENDORS ANDTHE ACQUISITIONS SUBSYSTEMS OF THE BIBLIOGRAPHIC UTILITIES. IT IS UNLIKELYTHAT A SINGLE SOURCE WILL OFFER A LIBRARY THE MOST SUITABLE FEATURES FOR EACHFUNCTION, AND THE PROBLEM BECOMES ONE OF INTEGRATING SYSTEMS FROM SEVERALSOURCES.
1825|LOCAL SYSTEMS' DESIGN AND COSTS.     CONTRIBUTION TO THE LITA (AMERICAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION. LIBRARY ANDINFORMATION TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION) INSTITUTE. A LOCAL APPROACH TO THEAUTOMATION OF ACQUISITIONS PROCESSES WAS, UNTIL COMPARATIVELY RECENTLY, THEONLY ALTERNATIVE AVAILABLE. GUIDELINES FOR THE DESIGN PROCESS ARE WELLDOCUMENTED; COSTS ARE NOT. INVESTIGATES PITFALLS TO A LOCAL APPROACH AND LISTSALTERNATIVES. EXPLORES TRENDS SUCH AS THE INCREASING IMPORTANCE OF INTERFACEWITH NATIONAL OR OTHER LOCAL SYSTEMS, AND THE GREATER DEMANDS FOR MANAGERIALDATA. SUGGESTS THAT A LESS RIGID, TRADITIONAL APPROACH TOWARDS AUTOMATINGACQUISITIONS FUNCTIONS MIGHT BE MORE EFFECTIVE, AND THAT A THOROUGHINVESTIGATION OF AVAILABLE ALTERNATIVES SHOULD PRECEDE A DECISION TO ADOPT ORMAINTAIN A TOTALLY LOCAL APPROACH.
1826|ISSUE DEVOTED TO PAPERS PRESENTED AT THE LITA INSTITUTE-PART 1|).T     HE INSTITUTE WAS PRESENTED TWICE, IN DEC 79| AT NASHVILLE, TENESSEE AND IN MAY80| AT VANCOUVER, BRITISH COLUMBIA.

1827|THE ROLE OF THE NETWORK IN AUTOMATED ACQUISITIONS.     CONTRIBUTION TO THE LITA (AMERICAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION. LIBRARY ANDINFORMATION TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION) INSTITUTE. EXAMINES NON-PROFITBIBLIOGRAPHIC NETWORKS TO ASSESS WHY THEY OFFER, OR PLAN TO OFFER ACQUISITIONSSERVICES, WHAT MAJOR CONTRIBUTIONS THEY CAN MAKE, AND THE ADVANTAGES ANDDISADVANTAGES OF NETWORK ACQUISITIONS SYSTEMS FOR INDIVIDUAL LIBRARIES.NETWORKS CAN CONTRIBUTE SIGNIFICANTLY BECAUSE CATALOGUING AND ACQUISITIONSFUNCTIONS ARE COMPLEMENTARY, AND THE NETWORKS CAN PROVIDE BOTH ACQUISITIONSAND IN-PROCESS CONTROL OVER MATERIALS, THUS ALLOWING A LIBRARY TO OPERATE MOREEFFICIENTLY WITH IMPROVED INTERNAL CONTROLS. AS A NETWORK SYSTEM WILL DISPLAYMEMBER HOLDINGS, COOPERATIVE ACQUISITIONS AND INTERLIBRARY LOAN WILL ALSO BEFACILITATED.
1828|VENDOR SYSTEMS AND ON-LINE ORDERING.     CONTRIBUTION TO THE LITA (AMERICAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION. LIBRARY ANDINFORMATION TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION) INSTITUTE.

1838|INTERLIBRARY LENDING' A SOUTH-EAST ASIAN PERSPECTIVE.     EDITED VERSION OF A PAPER GIVEN TO THE IFLA SECTION ON INTERLENDING AT THEIFLA GENERAL CONFERENCE, MANILA, THE PHILIPPINES, AUG 80|. SURVEYS INTERLENDINGIN THE COUNTRIES WHICH COMPRISE THE CONSORTIUM OF NATIONAL LIBRARIES ANDDOCUMENTATION CENTRES, SOUTH-EAST ASIA-INDONESIA, MALAYSIA, THE PHILIPPINES,SINGAPORE AND THAILAND. A QUESTIONNAIRE SURVEY REVEALED THAT THE VOLUME OFINTERLENDING VARIED GREATLY BETWEEN THESE COUNTRIES AND WAS GENERALLY LOW.MANY MORE INTERLIBRARY LOAN REQUESTS WERE SENT ABROAD THAN WERE RECEIVED. ONLYA FEW LIBRARIES HAD TELEPHONE AND TELEX LINKS, BUT MANY HAD REPROGRAPHICEQUIPMENT. REQUESTS WERE SENT MAINLY TO SUBJECT SPECIALIST LIBRARIES, ANDUNION CATALOGUES AND CENTRAL COLLECTIONS WERE LESS USED. CHARGES WERE MINIMAL.STRESSES THE IMPORTANCE OF MAINTAINING NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL STATISTICS.THIS IS 1| FUNCTION OF NATIONAL INTERLENDING CENTRES, WHICH SHOULD BEESTABLISHED AS INDEPENDENT UNITS IN ALL COUN TRIES.
1839|COMPUTER NETWORKS SYSTEMS' THE IMPACT OF TECHNOLOGY ON CO-OPERATIVEINTERLENDING IN THE USA.     REVISED VERSION OF A PAPER PRESENTED AT THE INTERNATIONAL SEMINAR ON NATIONALDOCUMENT PROVISION, BOSTON SPA, 22|-24| SEPT 80|. RECENT US DEVELOPMENTS HAVEFAVOURED DECENTRALISED NETWORKS RATHER THAN CENTRALISED RESOURCE LIBRARIES. USLIBRARIES LACK CENTRAL PLANNING AND FUNDING, AND PROGRESS DEPENDS ONINDIVIDUAL LIBRARY INITIATIVES. IN THE LAST 10| YEARS THIS HAS RESULTED INOCLC, RLG, WLN AND 20| REGIONAL NETWORKS. DESCRIBES THE 3| MAJOR COMPUTERCOMPUTER UTILITIES. THESE COMPUTER NETWORKS WOULD BE COMPLEMENTED NOTDUPLICATED BY CENTRAL RESOURCE LIBRARIES; WITH THE NATIONAL PERIODICALS CENTEREFFECTIVELY SHELVED, THE CENTER FOR RESEARCH LIBRARIES COULD ASSUME A MOREDYNAMIC ROLE. COMMERCIAL VENDORS ARE OFTEN OVERLOOKED, BUT ARE AN IMPORTANTELEMENT IN DOCUMENT DELIVERY SYSTEMS. THEY ARE COMPLETELY OUTSIDE CONVENTIONALLIBRARY SYSTEMS, AND MIGHT CREAM OFF THE PROFITABLE END OF THE DOCUMENT SUPPLYMARKET .
1840|SERIALS INVENTORY: A CASE STUDY.     A SERIALS UNIVERSITY PROJECT OF OVER 400|,000| VOLUMES WAS UNDERTAKEN AT THETEXAS A&M UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES. THE INVENTORY PROCEDURE IS DESCRIBED.STATISTICS FROM THE INVENTORY INDICATE THAT THERE IS NO CAUSE FOR ALARM OVEREXPENSIVE SERIAL VOLUMES DISAPPEARING FROM LIBRARY SHELVES. THE SUCCESSFULCOMPLETION OF THE PROJECT SHOWS THAT AN INVENTORY OF A LARGE SERIALSCOLLECTION REMAINS A SOUND METHOD IN MANAGING SERIALS COLLECTIONS.
1841|PUBLIC WELFARE CASE RECORDS' A STUDY OF ARCHIVAL PRACTICES.     THE US FEDERAL-STATE WELFARE SYSTEM, ESTABLISHED BY THE 1935| SOCIAL SECURITYACT, HAS GENERATED AN ENORMOUS NUMBER OF INDIVIDUAL CASE FILES ON WELFAREAPPLICANTS AND RECIPIENTS, WHICH ARE OF GREAT HISTORICAL VALUE. IN 1978| AQUESTIONNAIRE WAS SENT TO ALL STATE ARCHIVISTS TO IDENTIFY CURRENT PRACTICESAND PRINCIPAL PROBLEMS ENCOUNTERED REGARDING THE ACCESSIONING OF PUBLICWELFARE CASE RECORDS. THE STUDY WAS RESTRICTED TO FEDERAL-STATE CATEGORICALINCOME MAINTENANCE PROGRAMMES.

1842|THE CONSERVATION OF LIBRARY COLLECTIONS IN TROPICAL AND SUB-TROPICALCONDITIONS' THE PROBLEMS OF THE INCREASED DANGERS OF DAMAGE AND DECAY IN AREASOF HIGH TEMPERATURE AND HUMIDITY.     THE GENERAL POINT IS STRESSED THAT LIBRARY COLLECTIONS IN TROPICAL ANDSUB-TROPICAL CLIMATES ARE SUBJECT TO THE SAME DANGERS AS THOSE IN MODERATECLIMATE ZONES; BUT IT MUST BE UNDERSTOOD THAT ALL THESE DANGERS ARE INCREASED,SOME OF THEM DRAMATICALLY, IN WARM DAMP CLIMATES. IN TROPICAL AND SUB-TROPICALCLIMATES THERE IS THE THREAT OF DAMAGE BY INSECTS OF A NATURE AND TO AN EXTENTTHAT IS UNKNOWN IN MODERATE CLIMATE ZONES AND FINALLY, IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TOCHANGE THIS SITUATION FUNDAMENTALLY BY ANY CONSERVATION OR RESTORATIONMEASURES, AT LEAST NOT WITHOUT AN EXPENDITURE THAT WOULD BE UNREALISTIC INPRESENT TERMS OF MANPOWER AND ENERGY.

1845|FIRST, DO NO HARM' GIVING ADVICE ABOUT PHOTO-CONSERVATION.     IN 1979| IN THE USA, OVER 10| BILLION EXPOSURES WERE MADE BY 45| BILLION CAMERAS,BUT MOST OF THESE PHOTOGRAPHS WILL EVENTUALLY BE LOST, THROWN AWAY,SELF-DESTRUCT OR BE FORGOTTEN BEFORE ANYONE EVEN THINKS OF PRESERVING THEM FORPOSTERITY. MANY INSTITUTIONS HAVE ALREADY AMASSED TOO MANY PHOTOGRAPHS, AND SOPERHAPS PRESERVATION MUST BE CARRIED OUT BY THE PHOTOGRAPHS' ORIGINATORS. ONLYNOW IS SOME EFFORT BEING MADE TO ESTABLISH PROGRAMMES FOR THE FORMAL TRAININGOF CONSERVATORS, AND MOST AMATEURS STILL WANT CHEAP, QUICK AND EASY SOLUTIONS.IT FALLS TO LIBRARIANS, ARCHIVISTS AND CURATORS, THEREFORE TO MAKE USEFULINFORMATION READILY AVAILABLE TO THOSE WHO ASK FOR IT AND TO BE PREPARED TOCARRY IT TO THOSE WHO DO NOT. PRESENTS A LIST OF USEFUL AND RECENT SOURCEMATERIALS ON PHOTO-CONSERVATION. IF PUBLIC CONSCIOUSNESS CAN BE RAISED ENOUGHTO SEEK AND FOLLOW THE ADVICE GIVEN BY PROFESSIONALS, MUCH OF THE USA'SPHOTOGRAPHIC HERITAGE CAN BE S AVED.

DISCUSSES DRAWBACKS IN FILE COMPLETION AND IDENTIFIES WAYS OFINCREASING R EFFECTIVENESS.
1852|TO GROW OR NOT TO GROW?.     ENUMERATES AND COMMENTS ON THE MANY FACTORS THAT CAUSE INCREASED NEED FORACADEMIC LIBRARY SPACE. SINCE THE COLLECTION OCCUPIES ONLY FROM 25|-45|% OF THEFLOORSPACE IN LARGE ACADEMIC LIBRARIES, THESE OTHER FACTORS MUST ALSO BESTUDIED AND REMEDIED IN ORDER TO LIMIT BUILDING GROWTH. THE FOLLOWING MEASURESTO SLOW THE INCREASE IN STORAGE SPACE ARE REVIEWED IN DETAIL' WEEDING;ZERO-GROWTH; COMPACT STORAGE; COORDINATED ACQUISITIONS; MINIATURISATION. INCONNECTION WITH THE ARRANGEMENT OF STORED MATERIALS, DETAILED ARGUMENTS ARECITED WHY BROWSING IS AN INSUFFICIENT RETRIEVAL DEVICE FOR SERIOUS RESEARCH.THE POINT IS MADE THAT A COMBINATION OF THE ABOVE MEASURES IS NEEDED TO REDUCESPACE PRESSURES INHERITED FROM THE PAST. FURTHERMORE, IN ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OFTHE STUDIES SHOWING THAT A HIGH PROPORTION OF ACQUIRED WORKS IS RARELY IF EVERUSED, A MORE LIMITED AND REGIONALLY COORDINATED SELECTION POLICY IS NEEDED TOREDUCE FUTURE SPACE PRESSURES.

FINAL REPORT FOR THE PERIOD MARCH-MAY 1979|.     13| CITIES WERE VISITED TO MEET EXPERTS ON READING, EDUCATION, PSYCHOLOGY, DATAPROCESSING, LINGUISTICS AND LIBRARIANSHIP. SEVERAL RECOMMENDATIONS RESULTEDFROM THESE VISITS. THEY INCLUDE' (A) THE SETTING UP OF A VERY LOW BUDGETRESEARCH UNIT TO COLLECT AND DISSEMINATE INFORMATION; (B) FUTURE RESEARCH ONTHE BETTER PRESENTATION OF READABILITY DATA TO TEACHERS AND LIBRARIANS; (C)MORE WORK ON THE LINGUISTIC CHANGES INVOLVED IN SUMMARISING TEXT; (D) MOREEMPHASIS ON WHAT THE READER DOES WITH INFORMATION RETRIEVED, ESPECIALLY INPUBLIC LIBRARIES; AND (E) INVESTIGATION OF EDUCATION IN THE USE OF LITERATUREAS ONE OF A STANDARD RANGE OF STUDY SKILLS.
2100|PROJECTION, IDENTIFICATION, AND CRITICAL PARTICIPATION.     READING INTERESTS REFLECT PSYCHIC DEVELOPMENT, WHICH IN TURN URGES ONE TO READWHAT COULD BE HELPFUL' CRITICAL DISTANCING, SENSITIVITY TO THE CONFLICTS OFOTHERS, AND IDENTIFICATION WITH OPPOSITE ROLES ARE ALL VEHICLES FOR THEPROCESS OF PSYCHIC DEVELOPMENT. INVESTIGATES THE WAYS IN WHICH CHILDREN'S ANDYOUTH LIBRARIES GUIDE THE READER TO ACHIEVE CRITICAL DISTANCE.

READERS' MOTIVES ARE DIVIDED INTO' THOSE WHOSE READING IS DIRECTEDTOWARDS DEVELOPING THEIR SOCIAL AND MORAL OUTLOOK; THOSE WHO NEED HELP INCHOOSING A CAREER; THOSE WHO READ TO DEVELOP THEIR PERSONALITY; BUT FURTHERSUB-DIVISIONS MAY ALSO BE WORKED OUT.
2106|THE ADVANCEMENT OF READING AT WORK.     THE FACTORY LIBRARY SHOULD PROVIDE LITERATURE FOR ALL STAFF, ESPECIALLY THEWORKERS. IT IS DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN ACCURATE INFORMATION ON THE READING HABITSOF DIFFERENT SOCIAL GROUPS; WORKERS PROBABLY COMPRISE MORE THAN 1|/8| BUT LESSTHEN 1|/2| OF A FACTORY LIBRARY'S READERS. THE FACTORY LIBRARY IS THE LIBRARYMOST LIKELY TO PROMOTE READING AMONG THE WORKING CLASSES. IN FACTORYLIBRARIES, AS OPPOSED TO PUBLIC LIBRARIES, THERE ARE MORE ADULT READERS THANTEENAGE READERS AND MORE MALE READERS THAN FEMALE. MANY PEOPLE CONSIDER THATADULTS NEED TO READ MORE THAN THE YOUNG AND THAT THE WORKERS WHO DO READ, EVENIF ONLY LIGHT LITERATURE, WILL HAVE MORE ACTIVE AND COMMUNICATIVEPERSONALITIES THAN NON-READERS AND MAKE A LARGER CONTRIBUTION TO PRODUCTIVITY.

2160|THE ORGANISATION AND METHODS OF PLANNING RESEARCH WORK IN THE M.E.SALTYKOV-SHCHEDRIN STATE PUBLIC LIBRARY.     ADEQUATE PLANNING IS A NECESSARY PRE-REQUISITE OF ALL RESEARCH WORK. PLANNINGFOR LIBRARY RESEARCH FOLLOWS THE SAME GUIDELINES AS OTHER GOVERNMENT PLANNING,TAKING INTO ACCOUNT POLITICAL COMMITMENT, RELEVANCE, CONTINUITY ANDPURPOSIVENESS. 1|ST, A LIST OF THE MOST IMPORTANT PROBLEMS OVER THE NEXT 20|YEARS IS DRAWN UP; THEN A 5|-YEAR PLAN IS WORKED OUT TO CONCENTRATE ON THE MOSTIMMEDIATE OF THESE PROBLEMS; THEN A YEARLY PLAN IS DRAWN UP TO IMPLEMENT THE5|-YEAR PLAN. EXAMPLES OF SUCH A PROGRAMME IN OPERATION CAN BE SEEN IN THERESEARCH WORK OF THE SALTYKOV-SHCHEDRIN STATE PUBLIC LIBRARY.
2161|THE ENVIRONMENT FOR SPECIAL LIBRARIES IN THE 1980|S.     EVENTS AND DEVELOPMENTS OCCURRING NOW AND IN THE 1980|S WILL HAVE SUBSTANTIALIMPACT ON LIBRARIES AND THEIR OPERATIONS. EFFECTIVE PLANNING DEPENDS ONKNOWLEDGE OF LIKELY EVENTS AND TRENDS AND ON THE INTEGRATION OF THESE FACTORSINTO THE FUTURE OPERATIONS OF THE LIBRARY. THE SIGNIFICANT DEMOGRAPHIC,POLITICAL, SOCIAL, ECONOMIC, AND TECHNOLOGICAL TRENDS AFFECTING LIBRARIES AREREVIEWED. WHILE THE LIKELY EFFECTS OF THESE CHANGES ARE SUGGESTED, THEY DO NOTAPPLY UNIFORMLY TO ALL LIBRARIES. LIBRARIANS MUST SELECT THE FACTORSSIGNIFICANT TO THEIR LIBRARY AND PLAN WITHIN ITS SPECIFIC ENVIRONMENT.
2162|THE ENFORCED RE-ORGANIZATION OF INDUSTRIAL LIBRARIES.     (FLA THESIS). CONSIDERS THE INDUSTRIAL LIBRARY AS PART OF A PROFIT-MOTIVATEDORGANISATION, PROVIDING A LITERATURE AND INFORMATION SERVICE FOR THE BENEFITOF ITS PARENT COMPANY. THE SERVICE PROVIDED MUST BE INTEGRATED INTO THEMANAGEMENT AND CONTROL STRUCTURE OF THE COMPANY. AS PART OF THE ORGANISATIONTHE LIBRARY IS SUBJECT TO MANAGEMENT CONTROL IN THE SAME WAY AS ANY OTHER PARTOF THE ORGANISATION. MANAGEMENT DECISIONS, MADE IN A BROADER CONTEXT THAN THELIBRARY, AFFECT THE LIBRARY'S OPERATION AND ITS FUNCTIONS AND STAFF. THEEFFECT OF THESE DECISIONS ON THE LIBRARY ARE EXAMINED IN A NUMBER OF CASESWITH PARTICULAR EMPHASIS ON THE POLICY DECISIONS TAKEN BY FERRANTI LTD IN1975|, AND THEIR EFFECT ON THE COMPANY LIBRARIES.
2163|COOPERATION AMONG SPECIAL LIBRARIES AT THE INTERNATIONAL LEVEL.     AT THE INTERNATIONAL LEVEL, SPECIAL QUESTIONS ARISE REGARDING DIRECT ANDINDIRECT COOPERATION AMONG SPECIAL LIBRARIES. AS EXAMPLES OF THE POSSIBILITIESFOR EFFECTIVE COOPERATION, INCLUDING BILATERAL AGREEMENTS BETWEEN OFFICIAL ANDUNOFFICIAL BODIES, AN OVERVIEW IS GIVEN OF THE SPECIAL LIBRARY SITUATION INGERMANY AND BRAZIL. THE PRIORITIES FOR SUPPLYING LITERATURE IN SPECIALISEDFIELDS AND FOR INFORMATION RETRIEVAL ARE CONSIDERED. IN ADDITION, THEACTIVITIES AND WORKING METHODS OF SPECIAL LIBRARIES AND THEIR ECONOMIC ASPECTSARE SURVEYED TRACING THE SOURCES OF INFORMATION AND ITS USE. CONSIDERATION ISALSO GIVEN TO THE POLITICAL IMPACT OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF COOPERATION AMONGSPECIAL LIBRARIES.

IDENTIFIES THE REQUIREMENTS FOR THEIR FURTHERDEVELOPMENT, AND LOOKS AT THE NEED FOR NEW INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND MOREEFFECTIVE MARKETING FOR THE 80|S. REPORT NOT AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
2166|THE STRUCTURE OF ROMAN CATHOLIC LIBRARY WORK (III AND IV).     MOST WEST GERMANY DIOCESES HAVE A LIBRARY CENTRE RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL ROMANCATHOLIC PUBLIC LIBRARIES WITHIN THE DIOCESE. LIBRARY CENTRES WERE DEVELOPEDAFTER WORLD WAR 2| FROM THE BORROMEUS ASSOCIATION'S DIOCESAN CENTRES. A LIBRARYCENTRE'S TASKS INCLUDE' PROVIDING ADVICE AND PRACTICAL HELP FOR LIBRARYDEVELOPMENT; PROVIDING HELP WITH TECHNICAL PROBLEMS; ORGANISING BASIC ANDADVANCED TRAINING FOR PROFESSIONAL AND NON-PROFESSIONAL STAFF; ADMINISTERINGCHURCH AND PUBLIC FUNDS FOR THE LIBRARIES; REPRESENTING CHURCH LIBRARYINTERESTS WITHIN RELIGIOUS AND PUBLIC SPHERES; PROVIDING THEOLOGICAL MATERIALAND ESTABLISHING THE LIBRARY'S ROLE IN THE COMMUNITY. A STATE WORKING PARTYORGANISES THE COOPERATION OF ALL LIBRARY CENTRES WITHIN A FEDERAL STATE,ACTING AS THEIR REPRESENTATIVE BODY AND AS A FORUM FOR THE EXCHANGE OFEXPERIENCE. FOR PARTS 1| AND 2|, 2|SEE1| 80|/3571| AND 81|/289| RESPECTIVELY.
2167|RECOMMENDATIONS FOR CONSTRUCTING REGIONAL NETWORK SYSTEMS AND BUILDING UPREGIONAL LIBRARY CENTRES.     RECOMMENDATIONS FOR CONSTRUCTING REGIONAL NETWORK SYSTEMS AND BUILDING UPREGIONAL LIBRARY CENTRES WERE PUT FORWARD BY THE SUB-COMMITTEE ON DATAPROCESSING IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE LIBRARY COMMITTEE OF THE GERMAN RESEARCHSOCIETY (DEUTCHE FORSCHUNGSGEMEINSCHAFT). THEY UNDERLINE HOW NECESSARY ANDURGENT IT IS TO BUILD UP REGIONAL DATA PROCESSING NETWORKS FOR COOPERATIVECATALOGUING IN LIBRARIES. REGIONAL NETWORKS PROVIDE THE OPTIMAL MEANS OFRATIONALISING LIBRARY WORK. THESE NETWORKS SHOULD NOT BE CONSTRUCTED IN ALL 11|FEDERAL STATES BUT SHOULD BE BUILT UP ON THE EXISTING 7| LENDING SYSTEMREGIONS; THEY WOULD ALL BE CONNECTED IN A NATIONAL NETWORK. REGIONAL LIBRARYCENTRES WOULD FORM THE NATIONAL NETWORK AND WOULD HAVE THE FOLLOWING GENERALTASK AREAS' CATALOGUING AND ACQUISITION, CENTRAL EDITING OF CATALOGUES ETC.,DATA EXCHANGE WITH OTHER CENTRAL INSTITUTES AND NETWORKS, SUPPLYING ORDEREDBOO KS WITHIN THE PLANNED NATIONAL ORDER SYSTEM, DEVELOPING SYSTEMS ANDPROGRAMMES FOR THE SOFTWARE OF THE REGIONAL NETWORK, AND PLANNING ANDCOORDINATION.
2168|DO LIBRARIES HAVE POLITICAL DUTIES?.     MANY TASKS UNDERTAKEN BY PUBLIC LIBRARIES ARE POLITICAL, NOT BECAUSE THEYPROMOTE PARTY POLITICS BUT BECAUSE THEY PROVIDE ENLIGHTENMENT AND PLEASURE FOREACH INDIVIDUAL IN A FREE DEMOCRACY. CULTURE INVOLVES NOT ONLY BEAUTY BUT ALSOSOCIAL REALITY. LIBRARIANS MUST HELP ALL HANDICAPPED PEOPLE; GERMANY IS AHEADOF FRANCE IN LIBRARY WORK WITH THE PHYSICALLY HANDICAPPED AND PROVISION OFLIBRARY FACILITIES FOR FOREIGN WORKERS CERTAINLY INVOLVES BOTH CULTURE ANDPOLITICS. THE LIBRARIES MUST PROMOTE READING, OR BOOKS MAY BE OUSTED BYAUDIO-VISUAL MEDIA. STOCK SELECTION CRITERIA MUST BE THOSE OF TRUTH ANDOBJECTIVITY; THE LIBRARIAN MUST BE MINDFUL OF ALL VIEWPOINTS, SINCE FREEDOMPERMITS OPPOSITION.
2169|PUBLIC RELATIONS IN UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES.     CHALLENGES THE POPULARLY HELD BELIEF THAT THE UNIVERSITY LIBRARY HAS A CAPTIVEAUDIENCE, AND THEREFORE REQUIRES LITTLE OR NO PUBLIC RELATIONS PROGRAMME.ARGUES THAT THE USE OF THE ACADEMIC LIBRARY BY STAFF AND STUDENTS MUST NOT BETAKEN FOR GRANTED, AND THAT DETAILED GUIDANCE IN THE USE OF THE LIBRARY SHOULDBE GIVEN TO POSTGRADUATES AND UNDERGRADUATES. OFFERS SOME ADVICE ON THEIMPLEMENTATION OF A SUCCESSFUL PUBLIC RELATIONS PROGRAMME, AND SUGGESTS THEDESIGNATION OF A LIBRARIAN AS A PUBLIC RELATIONS OFFICER.
2170|SELLING THE BUSINESS LIBRARY.     IN TODAY'S COST-CONSCIOUS ECONOMY, IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT THE SPECIAL LIBRARYHAS A WELL-DEFINED PUBLIC RELATIONS PROGRAMME. PUBLIC RELATIONS ACTIVITIES ANDPROBLEMS OF THE SPECIAL LIBRARY IN A BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT ARE CONSIDERED. THEAUDIENCES SERVED ARE IDENTIFIED, AND SOME OF THE ACTIVE MEANS BY WHICHBUSINESS LIBRARIES CAN SUCCESSFULLY SELL THEIR SERVICES ARE OUTLINED.
2171|THE NATIONAL PLANNING FOR LIBRARIES, DOCUMENTATION ARCHIVES AND INFORMATIONSERVICES WITH REFERENCE TO GENERAL INFORMATION PROGRAMME FOR BOTSWANA.     (MLS DISSERTATION.) AN ACCOUNT OF THE STRUCTURE OF EXISTING LIBRARY,DOCUMENTATION, AND ARCHIVES SERVICES IN BOTSWANA, BIBLIOGRAPHICAL CONTROLSERVICES, PUBLISHING AND DISTRIBUTION SERVICES, AND THE GENERAL INFORMATIONPROGRAMME AND ITS IMPLICATIONS FOR BOTSWANA. CONCLUDES THAT WHILST THERE HAVEBEEN SOME ACHIEVEMENTS, IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT EXISTING SERVICES BE IMPROVED.THE NATIONAL INFORMATION INFRASTRUCTURE SHOULD BE REASSESSED AND DEVELOPED INORDER TO COPE WITH THE PRESENT SOCIO-ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL DEMANDS. HOPESTHAT THE NECESSARY BOLD STEPS WILL BE TAKEN TO DEVELOP A FULLY INTEGRATED ANDEFFECTIVE NATIONAL INFORMATION SYSTEM.
2172|THE LEGAL POSITION OF POLYTECHNIC ('FACHHOCHSCHUL-') LIBRARIES AFTER THE NEWPOLYTECHNIC (UNIVERSITY) LAWS.     IN 1979| NEW UNIVERSITY LAWS WERE PASSED WHICH AFFECTED POLYTECHNIC('FACHHOCHSCHUL-') LAWS AND THE LEGAL POSITION OF POLYTECHNIC LIBRARIES.ALTHOUGH POLYTECHNICS DIFFER IN FORM SLIGHTLY FROM ONE STATE TO ANOTHER WITHINWEST GERMANY, THERE ARE SOME GENERAL POINTS IN THE NEW LAWS WHICH INFLUENCEPOLYTECHNIC LIBRARIES IN THE SAME WAY. THE STATUS OF THE LIBRARIES HAS BECOMEMORE PRECISE; THEY ARE RECOGNISED AS CENTRAL WORKING UNITS. THE LIBRARIES NOWHAVE THE RIGHT TO MAKE DECISIONS CONCERNING BUDGET EXPENDITURE AND THEALLOCATION OF NEW STAFF. THE POLYTECHNIC LIBRARY HAS THUS BECOME ANINDEPENDENT INSTITUTION WITH ITS OWN DUTIES AND RIGHTS WITHIN THE POLYTECHNIC.HOWEVER, LIBRARIES STILL DEPEND ON THE SIZE OF ALLOCATIONS FROM THE CENTRALPOLYTECHNIC BODIES. FINAL DECISIONS ON THE CHOICE OF LITERATURE ACQUISITIONCAN STILL ONLY BE MADE BY THE RELEVANT POLYTECHNIC DEPARTMENT WITH THE LIBRARY MERELY ACTING IN AN ADVISORY CAPACITY.
2173|HOW CAN LIBRARY EFFECTIVENESS BE MEASURED?.     EXAMINES THE LIBRARY LITERATURE WHICH DEALS WITH MEASUREMENT OF LIBRARYEFFECTIVENESS. THIS IS USUALLY MEASURED IN TERMS OF LOAN FIGURES, BUT THISMETHOD FAILS TO TAKE ACCOUNT OF REFERENCE AND INFORMATION WORK, NOW OF GROWINGIMPORTANCE. EFFECTIVENESS MUST BE SEEN IN RELATION TO THE LIBRARY'S AIMS. AMANUAL FOR PERFORMANCE MEASURES IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES WAS PUBLISHED IN 1976| BYTHE AMERICAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION. FOR THOSE LIBRARIES WHICH ACTIVELY PROMOTEMATERIALS TO CREATE DEMANDS, HAMBURG ET AL (1972|) SUGGEST THE FOLLOWING TESTSFOR EFFECTIVENESS' EXPOSURE COUNTS, ITEM USE-DAYS, EXPOSURE TIME. GORE (1978|)USES THE HOLDINGS RATE, AVAILABILITY RATE, AND PERFORMANCE RATE, THE LATTERMEASURING THE PERCENTAGE OF REQUIRED MATERIAL AVAILABLE WHEN WANTED BY USER.IT HAS BEEN POINTED OUT THAT BECAUSE EFFECTIVENESS IS A COMPOSITE CONCEPT ITSMEASUREMENT IS COMPLEX, BUT THAT RELYING ON LOAN FIGURES ONLY IS NO LONGERNECESSARY.
2174|LIBRARY DATA, STATISTICS AND INFORMATION' PROGRESS TOWARD COMPARABILITY.     LIBRARIES OF ALL KINDS AND SIZES ARE INCREASINGLY BOUND BY COMMON NEEDS ANDCONCERNS. THIS SYMBIOSIS HAS PLACED NEW DEMANDS UPON THE COMMUNITY. PRIMARYAMONG THESE IS THE DEMAND FOR COMMON UNDERSTANDINGS AND A LANGUAGE IN WHICH TOSHARE THESE UNDERSTANDINGS. ONE AVENUE TO SUCH AN OBJECTIVE IS OUTLINED.FOREMOST TO THIS DEVELOPMENT IS A FRAMEWORK OF INFORMATION ABOUT LIBRARIES. AMETHOD BY WHICH TO CATALOGUE THE IMPRESSIONS OF LIBRARY BEHAVIOUR AND FROMWHICH TO MOVE TO SOME EMPIRICALLY BASED AND SOUND THEORY OF LIBRARY BEHAVIOURIS DESCRIBED.
2175|LIBRARY MANAGEMENT.     COMPRISES THE FORMAL PAPERS PRESENTED DURING 5| WORKSHOPS SPONSORED BY THE USSPECIAL LIBRARIES ASSOCIATION (SLA) LIBRARY MANAGEMENT DIVISION, COSPONSOREDBY THE BUSINESS AND FINANCE, INSURANCE, AND MILITARY LIBRARIANS DIVISIONS, ANDHELD DURING THE SLA'S 70|TH ANNUAL CONFERENCE, HONOLULU, HAWAII, 7|-14| JUNE 79|.THE WORKSHOPS CONSIDERED 5| ASPECTS OF LIBRARY MANAGEMENT' JOB DESCRIPTIONS ANDPERFORMANCE STANDARDS; MANAGEMENT COMMUNICATION PROBLEMS; COST RECOVERY AS ASOURCE OF LIBRARY FUNDING; CAREER PATHS FOR SPECIAL LIBRARIANS; ANDCOST/BENEFIT ANALYSIS IN THE SPECIAL LIBRARY.
2176|REGIONAL PROBLEMS IN LIBRARIANSHIP' A STATEMENT OF THE SITUATION.     BASIC PROBLEMS IN REGIONAL LIBRARIANSHIP CAN BE IDENTIFIED AND USED ASSUBJECTS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH. THEY INCLUDE' (1|) REGIONAL PECULIARITIESREGARDING THE DISPERSAL AND USAGE OF LIBRARY RESOURCES; (2|) THE NEED FOR MORERATIONAL GEOGRAPHICAL DIVISIONS BETWEEN LIBRARY SYSTEMS; (3|) THE FORMATION OFCOORDINATED PROGRAMMES AND AIMS FOR SUCH GEOGRAPHICALLY-BASED SYSTEMS; (4|) THENEED FOR LEVELLING-UP STANDARDS OF LIBRARY SERVICE WITHIN THE DIFFERENTREGIONS; (5|) THE NEED TO INCREASE MANAGEMENT EFFICIENCY GENERALLY.CONSIDERATION OF THESE PROBLEMS WILL PROVIDE A SOUND BASIS FOR FUTUREDEVELOPMENT.
2177|NOW THAT I'M IN CHARGE, WHAT DO I DO?'' SIX RULES ABOUT RUNNING A SPECIALLIBRARY FOR THE NEW LIBRARY MANAGER.M     UCH ATTENTION IS GIVEN TO THE TECHNICAL SKILLS THAT ARE NEEDED WHEN WORKING INA COMPANY LIBRARY. BUT THE KNOWLEDGE AND ATTITUDES THAT ARE NECESSARY FORMANAGING ONE, ESPECIALLY DURING THE CURRENT INFORMATION AGE, ARE LESSFREQUENTLY EXAMINED. 6| BASIC PRINCIPLES THE LIBRARIAN SHOULD KEEP IN MIND WHENMANAGING A COMPANY LIBRARY ARE DISCUSSED.
2178|SCHOOL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT. IMPLICATIONS FOR SCHOOL LIBRARY SERVICE.     PREPARED FOR SUBMISSION TO THE NEW SOUTH WALES DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION TOASSIST THE DEPARTMENT'S OFFICERS IN THEIR EFFORTS TO DEVELOP A COHESIVESTATEMENT ON THE ROLE, FUNCTION, AND STAFFING OF SCHOOL LIBRARIES. FOCUSES ONPOLICY ISSUES IN THE AREA OF SCHOOL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT IN THE CONTEXT OF 3|TIERS-THE SCHOOL LEVEL, REGIONAL LEVEL, AND CENTRAL SUPPORT SERVICES.
2179|DECISION-MAKING PROCESSES FOR INFORMATION MANAGERS.     HARRISON'S MODEL OF GROUP DECISION MAKING IS DESCRIBED AND DISCUSSED IN TERMSOF ITS IMPLICATIONS FOR THE DECISIONS LIBRARIANS AND OTHER INFORMATIONMANAGERS ARE CALLED UPON TO MAKE. ATTENTION IS GIVEN TO QUESTIONS OF DECISIONQUALITY AND TO FACTORS, SUCH AS GROUP SIZE, REWARD AND PENALTY MECHANISMS, ANDGROUP NORMS, WHICH AFFECT DECISION MAKING WITHIN GROUPS. INFORMATION MANAGERSHAVE SPECIAL RESPONSIBILITIES WHEN IT COMES TO GROUP DECISION MAKING'IMPROVING THEIR OWN GROUP DECISION-MAKING SKILLS AND PROCESSES, REMOVINGBARRIERS TO EFFECTIVE GROUP DECISION MAKING, BROADENING THE INFORMATIONRESOURCE BASE THEY AND THEIR CLIENTS USE IN DECISION MAKING, DESIGNINGINFORMATION SYSTEMS TO FACILITATE DECISION MAKING, AND RAISING THE VISIBILITYOF THE LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SCIENCES AS CONTRIBUTING DISCIPLINES TO THEDECISION SCIENCES.
2180|DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS IN LIBRARIES.     THE USE OF COMPUTERS AND MANAGEMENT SCIENCE/OPERATIONS RESEARCH IN LIBRARIESIS REVIEWED. THE CONCEPT OF A DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEM (DSS) IS INTRODUCED. DSSCAN BE VIEWED AS A SYNTHESIS OF THE USE OF COMPUTERS AND QUANTITATIVE METHODSTO ASSIST LIBRARIANS IN MANAGERIAL DECISION-MAKING SITUATIONS. AN EXAMPLE OF ADSS APPLICATION FOR A MEDIUM-SIZED LIBRARY IS DESCRIBED.
2181|ARE SUBJECT INFORMATION CENTRES THE MODERN INFORMATION SOURCE FOR EVERYONE?.     LECTURE GIVEN IN BONN TO A STUDY GROUP FOR ARCHIVES, LIBRARIES ANDDOCUMENTATION CENTRES (N.D.)THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S INFORMATION ANDDOCUMENTATION PROGRAMME HAS AS ITS FOCAL POINT THE FOUNDATION OF 16|CENTRALISED SUBJECT INFORMATION CENTRES BETWEEN 1974| AND 1977|. THIS INITIALSTAGE IS NOT YET COMPLETED OWING TO LACK OF FUNDS; ONLY 3| CENTRES ARE FULLYOPERATIONAL. THE ADEQUACY OF THESE CENTRES HAS BEEN QUESTIONED, ESPECIALLYBECAUSE OF THE EMPHASIS ON CENTRALISATION AND THE INTRODUCTION OF MARKETECONOMY PRINCIPLES; INFORMATION STORED MIGHT BE SELECTED MAINLY TO SUITINDUSTRY. IT IS NOT YET KNOWN WHETHER LIBRARIES MUST CONTRIBUTE TOWARDS COSTS,WHICH WILL BE EXPENSIVE. TRADE UNIONISTS FEAR THAT THE ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY INTHE CENTRES WILL RESULT IN STAFF STRESS AND THAT CENTRALISATION WILL REDUCEEMPLOYMENT.
2182|IMPROVING THE SYSTEM OF METHODOLOGICAL GUIDANCE.     METHODOLOGICAL GUIDANCE IS AN ESSENTIAL FEATURE OF SOVIET LIBRARIANSHIP. THEINVOLVEMENT OF THE GOVERNMENT IN THE PROVISION OF THIS GUIDANCE CAN BE TRACEDBACK TO THE 1920|S. TODAY IT HAS REACHED A HIGHER LEVEL OF EFFICIENCY IN ACTINGTHROUGH THE CENTRALISED LIBRARY NETWORKS SET UP THROUGHOUT THE USSR. THE WAYSIN WHICH THE LIBRARY SERVING AS THE GUIDANCE CENTRE WITHIN A NETWORK CANINFLUENCE THE WORK OF ITS DEPENDENT LIBRARIES CAN BE CLEARLY DEFINED, ANDILLUSTRATED IN TABULAR FORM, BUT THERE IS STILL A NEED FOR MORE COOPERATIONAND BETTER TRAINING FOR STAFF WORKING IN THESE CENTRES.
2183|PARTY-IN-POWER AS A DETERMINANT OF STATE AID TO PUBLIC LIBRARIES.     THIS STUDY MEASURES CHANGES OVER NEARLY 30| YEARS IN THE AMOUNT OF AID PROVIDEDBY STATE GOVERNMENTS TO PUBLIC LIBRARIES AND THE RELATIONSHIP OF THESE CHANGESTO THE PARTY IN POWER. AID IS EXAMINED AT 2| LEVELS' THE 1|ST VIEWS THE PARTY INPOWER AT THE INCEPTION OF STATE AID, THE 2|ND NOTES THE PARTY WHEN ASIGNIFICANT INCREASE IS MADE IN AID LEVELS. NEITHER CONDITION PRODUCES ADEFINITIVE RELATIONSHIP TO THE PARTY IN POWER AS DEFINED BY THE STUDY, ANDPROGRESS IN AID SEEMS NEARLY EVENLY DIVIDED BETWEEN THE ASCENDANT PARTIES, ORAT LEAST IN PROPORTION TO THE DOMINANT PARTY ACROSS THE USA AT THE TIME.REPORT NOT AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
2184|SAVE! THAT MEANS AGAIN FEWER BOOKS.     THE LIBRARY INSPECTORATE HAS EXAMINED PUBLIC LIBRARY ACCOUNTS FOR 1981|. THESESHOW AN OVERALL INCREASE WELL WITHIN THE SAVINGS CIRCULAR'S LIMIT OF 2|% REALGROWTH. BECAUSE OF BOOK PRICE RISES, ACQUISITIONS ARE LIKELY TO SHOW ANOVERALL FALL OF 4|%. THE SAVINGS CIRCULAR URGED LIBRARIES TO SPEND NOT MORETHAN 185| KR. PER INHABITANT. IT IS DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE WHAT EFFECT THISSTATEMENT HAS HAD, BUT A CLOSER EXAMINATION SHOWS THAT THE HIGHEST SPENDERS,ALL IN THE COPENHAGEN AREA, HAVE CUT DOWN MOST. IN THE REST OF THE COUNTRYPART-TIME LIBRARIES SHOW LARGER PERCENTAGE INCREASES THAN FULL-TIME LIBRARIES.ONLY THE SOUTHERN JUTLAND REGION SHOW A CONSIDERABLE REAL INCREASE INEXPENDITURE ON MATERIALS. AS STAFF SALARIES ARE SUBJECT TO TOPPING UP IFNECESSARY, THESE DO NOT SUFFER AS MUCH FROM CUTS AS MATERIAL EXPENDITURE, ANDTHE PROSPECT IS ONE OF LIBRARIES WITH OUTDATED AND WORN BOOKS.
2185|A COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF THREE MAJOR MODELS MOST FREQUENTLY USED IN APPLYINGCOMPUTER TECHNOLOGY IN ACADEMIC LIBRARIES IN THE SOUTHEAST.     (PHD THESIS-GEORGE PEABODY COLLEGE FOR TEACHERS).

(MLS DISSERTATION). 5| UK POLYTECHNIC LIBRARIES (AT MANCHESTER, OXFORD,HATFIELD, TRENT, AND COVENTRY (LANCHESTER)) WERE SURVEYED WITH SPECIALREFERENCE TO THE INFLUENCE OF MULTI-SITE OPERATION ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OFREADER SERVICES. THE LIBRARIES PLACED MUCH EMPHASIS ON THE ROLE OF SUBJECTSPECIALISTS IN MAINTAINING GOOD USER RELATIONS. ALL FOUND IT EASIER TO BUILDUP SUCH RELATIONS IN SMALLSITE RATHER THAN LARGE CENTRAL LIBRARIES. OPINIONSAND POLICIES CONCERNING SUBJECT SPECIALIST DUTIES VARIED. ALTERNATIVES TOSUBJECT SPECIALIST SYSTEMS WERE NOT FAVOURED. FINANCIAL CONSTRAINTS WEREHAVING A PROFOUND EFFECT ON THE EFFORTS OF POLYTECHNICS TO CONCENTRATE THEIRWORK ON 1| CAMPUS.

REVIEWS SOME OFTHE ARGUMENTS FOR AND AGAINST THE IDEA OF A TEACHING FUNCTION FOR REFERENCELIBRARIANS WHICH HAVE BEEN PUT FORWARD WITHIN THE US LIBRARY PROFESSION.DESCRIBES THE WAY IN WHICH THE LIBRARIAN FULFILS HIS TEACHING ROLE ON A 1| TO 1|BASIS AT THE REFERENCE DESK, AND BY PREPARING VARIOUS KINDS OF USER GUIDES.ARGUES THAT IN SCHOOL AND ACADEMIC LIBRARIES THE TEACHING FUNCTION OF THELIBRARIAN MUST BE INTENSIFIED BECAUSE OF THE EDUCATIONAL OBJECTIVES INHERENTIN THESE ENVIRONMENTS. SUGGESTS THAT WITH DECREASING LIBRARY BUDGETS IN THE1980|S, LIBRARIANS, ESPECIALLY THOSE IN REFERENCE SERVICES, WILL BE FACED WITHJUSTIFYING THEIR FUNCTIONS AND THAT A SUITABLE WAY OF DOING THIS WOULD BE FORTHE LIBRARY TO BECOME A 'TEACHING LIBRARY'.
2194|STAFFING REFERENCE SERVICE IN UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES' A COST EFFECTIVE MODEL FORADMINISTRATIVE DECISIONS.     (PHD THESIS-TEXAS WOMAN'S UNIVERSITY.)

2343|A VIEW FROM BANGLADESH.     CONTRIBUTION TO A SECTION DEVOTED TO PLANNING INTERLENDING SYSTEMS FORDEVELOPING COUNTRIES. AN INTERLENDING SYSTEM IS VITAL FOR THE DEVELOPMENT ANDSUPPORT OF LITERACY, EDUCATION AND RESEARCH, AND OF INDUSTRY AND THE ECONOMYGENERALLY. INTERLENDING TAKES PLACE IN BANGLADESH BETWEEN CERTAIN GROUPS OFLIBRARIES BUT PROGRESS IS HAMPERED BY THE LACK OF A STRONG NATIONAL LIBRARY TOGIVE LEADERSHIP IN SHARED ACQUISITION AND INTERLENDING POLICIES. ANOTHERPROBLEM ARISES BECAUSE DIFFERENT TYPES OF LIBRARY COME UNDER DIFFERENTGOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS, WITH NO COORDINATION AGENCY. PROGRESS WILL DEPEND ONSYSTEMATIC COOPERATION BETWEEN LIBRARIES.
2344|A VIEW FROM BRAZIL.     CONTRIBUTION TO A SECTION DEVOTED TO PLANNING INTERLENDING SYSTEMS FORDEVELOPING COUNTRIES. FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE LIBRARY PLANNING IN BRAZILINCLUDE ITS LARGE SIZE, ITS VERY YOUNG POPULATION, ITS STRUGGLINGSEMI-INDUSTRIALISED ECONOMY, THE UNEVEN LEVEL OF EDUCATION, AND LOW LEVELS OFRESEARCH ACTIVITY AND PUBLISHING OUTPUT. MODERNISATION MEANS THAT THE DEMANDFOR DOCUMENTS IS POTENTIALLY VERY LARGE. DOCUMENT SUPPLY WILL BE ORGANISEDTHROUGH DIFFERENT ECONOMIC OR ADMINISTRATIVE SECTORS, SUCH AS AGRICULTURE,ENERGY, OR EDUCATION. HOWEVER, THESE WILL NEED TO BE COORDINATED TO AVOID GAPSOR UNNECESSARY DUPLICATION IN SUBJECT COVERAGE, AND SOME DEGREE OFCENTRALISATION IS DESIRABLE.

MOST COMMON FORMS OF DAMAGE OCCUR THROUGHUNSTABLE CLIMATIC CONDITIONS, INCORRECT LIGHTING, DUST, BIOLOGICAL CAUSES(MICRO-ORGANISMS AND INSECTS) AND CHEMICAL CAUSES (OXIDATION AND HYDROLYSIS OFTHE CELLULOSE). TO PROTECT ORIGINAL MATERIAL, COPIES SHOULD BE LENT TO THEUSER WHENEVER POSSIBLE. RESTORATION SHOULD ONLY BE CARRIED OUT WHEN IT ISUNAVOIDABLE. EVERY STEP OF THE RESTORATION PROCESS SHOULD BE DOCUMENTED ASLIBRARIANS SHOULD REALISE THAT EVEN EXPERT RESTORATION CAN LEAD TOFALSIFICATION AND DISTORTION OF THE ORIGINAL .

THE PROPOSED DANISHSYSTEM CAN BE DESCRIBED AS A MIXTURE OF LIBRIS AND BUMS AND CONSIDERABLECENTRAL GUIDANCE BY THE LIBRARY CENTRE IS ASSUMED. THE WORKING PARTY SEEMS TOHAVE LITTLE FAITH IN THE ABILITY OF INDIVIDUAL LIBRARIES TO CATALOGUEACCORDING TO THE NORMS, FOR IT PROPOSES THAT CENTRAL LIBRARIES HELP THESMALLER LIBRARIES WITH THE DECENTRALISED INPUT. THE COSTS OF THIS SYSTEM ARE,HOWEVER, HIGH, AND THE SWEDISH SYSTEM, WHERE THE LIBRARY SERVICE CATALOGUESFROM PHOTOCOPIED TITLE PAGES THOSE TITLES NOT FOUND IN THE CENTRAL DATA BASE,IS PREFERABLE. CRITICISES THE REPORT FOR NOT CARRYING OUT ECONOMIC COSTING OFTHE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE STANDARD SPECIFICATIONS. THE REPORT EXAGGERATES THECOSTS OF PRODUCING LOCAL CATALOGUES IN PRINTED FORM AND NEGLECTS TO CONSIDERUSE OF MODERN TECHNOLOGY, E.G. LASER PRINTERS, FOR THIS PRODUCTION.

SUGGESTS ARESEARCH PROJECT INTO THE INFORMATION USE OF PROFESSIONALS IN A VARIETY OFFIELDS, USING DATA GATHERED BY LIBRARIANS OBSERVING PROFESSIONALS AT WORK. THERESULTS COULD FORM AN IDEAL BASIS FOR DISCOVERING THE WAYS IN WHICHINFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SHOULD EVOLVE IN KEEPING WITH INFORMATION-SEEKINGPATTERNS. SUCH KNOWLEDGE WOULD BE INVALUABLE FOR ALL THOSE INTERESTED IN THEFUTURE OF SERIALS.
2488|THE ROLE OF SUBSCRIPTION AGENTS.     DISCUSSES THE ROLE OF THE SUBSCRIPTION AGENT FOR SERIALS IN THE UK.

TO FIND OUT WHETHER REVIEWS OF PICTURE BOOKS REALLY REVIEW THE PICTURES, 50|REVIEWS PUBLISHED IN 1979| BY EACH OF 4| WIDELY-RESPECTED REVIEWING SOURCES ((1|)2|HORNBOOK1|, (2|) 2|BOOKLIST1|, (3|) 2|SCHOOL LIBRARY JOURNAL1|, AND (4|) 2|BULLETIN OFTHE CENTER FOR CHILDREN'S BOOKS1|) WERE SELECTED AT RANDOM. A COUNT WAS MADE OFTHE PROPORTION OF WORDS DESCRIBING THE ILLUSTRATIONS AND ALL FACTORSCONTRIBUTING TO THE 'LOOK' OF A PICTURE BOOK. 70|% OF REVIEWS IN (1|), 82|% IN(2|), 78|% IN (3|), AND 94|% IN (4|) DEVOTED 30|% OR LESS OF THEIR WORDS TO VISUALQUALITIES. THESE RESULTS EXPOSE AN OMISSION IN THE REVIEWERS' RESPONSIBILITIESAND A DISSERVICE TO READERS.
2491|A STUDY OF THE SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION SYSTEM IN THE UNITED KINGDOM.     REPORT OF A STUDY UNDERTAKEN BY THE SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION COMMITTEE OF THEROYAL SOCIETY. THE MAJOR CONCLUSION IS THAT A COMBINATION OF PRESSURES WILLVERY SOON PUT THE UK'S SCHOLARLY SCIENTIFIC PUBLICATION SYSTEM UNDERCONSIDERABLE STRAIN. IT WILL BE NECESSARY TO PROVIDE EXTRA FUNDING. 2| MAINPOSSIBILITIES ARE A SUBSIDY OF PUBLICATIONS AND INCREASED PROVISION FORLIBRARIES (ENABLING THEM TO PURCHASE A COMPREHENSIVE RANGE OF PUBLICATIONS ANDTHUS ALSO GENERATING INCOME FOR THE PUBLISHERS).
2492|BIOCHEMISTRY AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY JOURNAL PRICES.     A STUDY OF BIOCHEMISTRY AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY JOURNAL PRICES FOR 1967|-79| ISPRESENTED. RESULTS SHOW THAT THESE JOURNALS ARE COMPARABLE IN COST TO PHYSICSAND CHEMISTRY JOURNALS, PREVIOUSLY FOUND MOST COSTLY. WHEN WEIGHTED AVERAGESARE COMPARED, THESE JOURNALS ARE THE MOST EXPENSIVE FOR WHICH PRICE DATA AREAVAILABLE IN THE USA. A SMALL NUMBER OF HIGHLY CITED JOURNALS ACCOUNT FORNEARLY 50|% OF THE COST OF THE ENTIRE LIST OF 83| JOURNALS STUDIED-A FACT WHICHHAS SERIOUS IMPLICATIONS FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF JOURNAL COLLECTIONS. THE NEEDFOR GOVERNMENT SUBSIDIES TO ACADEMIC LIBRARIES FOR THE PURCHASE OF SCIENTIFICJOURNALS IS REITERATED.

THE 1981| FAIR ILLUSTRATED THE MISERABLE NATURE OF PRESENT-DAY PUBLISHING BUTWAS A TRUE PICTURE OF CHILDREN'S LITERATURE, 80|% OF WHICH CONSISTS OF COMICS,PICTURE-BOOKS AND COLOURED BOOKS, ALL IN POOR TASTE. CHILDREN'S BOOKS INGENERAL ARE AT A LOW LEVEL-THE TV SCREEN IN BOOK FORM-AND THE QUESTION ISWHETHER COLOURS AND PICTURES SELL WHEREAS CULTURE DOES NOT. SCANDINAVIAN BOOKPRODUCTION DIFFERS MARKEDLY FROM THAT OF OTHER COUNTRIES IN VARIETY, BREADTHAND WELL-DEFINED TASTE BUT IS IN AN OBVIOUSLY SCANDINAVIAN STYLE. THE 1981|BOLOGNA FAIR WAS DULL, WITH LITTLE NEW OR OUTSTANDINGLY INTERESTING, ANDBUSINESS ALSO APPEARED TO BE POOR AND MOSTLY CONCERNED WITH JOINTBOOK-PRODUCTION IN DIFFERENT COUNTRIES.

USING THE UNIVERSAL MODEL OF TRANSFORMATION OF INFORMATION AND THROUGHSTRUCTURE OF DATA FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF THE THEORY OF REFLECTION, THESIMILARITIES AND DIFFERENCES BETWEEN PRIMARY, SECONDARY AND TERTIARYINFORMATION ARE OUTLINED. ACCORDING TO WHETHER THE SYMBOL IS A REFLECTION OFPHENOMENA OR A REFLECTION OF A SYMBOL (SIGN), VARIOUS ORDERS OF THE REFLECTIONARE RECOGNISED, I.E. THE ORDER OF THE SYMBOL REFLECTION. THUS PRIMARYINFORMATION IS A REFLECTION OF A PHENOMENON DEPOSITED WITHOUT A SIGN/MARK,SECONDARY INFORMATION IS A REFLECTION OF THE DEPOSITED SIGNS, ETC. THESTATEMENT GIVING THE SPACE AND TIME IN WHICH A PHENOMENON IS VALID IS CALLEDTHE ADDRESS.
2537|THE ACADEMIC LIBRARIAN.     THE CAREER OF A LIBRARIAN SHOULD COMBINE THE PRACTICAL SIDE OF LIBRARIANSHIPWITH ACADEMIC KNOWLEDGE AND RESEARCH. NOWADAYS NEW RESEARCH IN LIBRARY SCIENCEIS USUALLY CARRIED OUT IN TEAMS RATHER THAN BY INDIVIDUALS. MODERN LIBRARIANSHAVE TO POSSESS A WIDE RANGE OF KNOWLEDGE COVERING MANY FIELDS AND IT IS NOLONGER USUAL FOR A LIBRARIAN TO BE AN EXPERT IN ONLY 1| SUBJECT. TEACHERS ATLIBRARY SCHOOLS ARE OFTEN PART-TIME LIBRARIANS AND PROVIDE STUDENTS WITH ANUNDERSTANDING OF DAILY LIBRARY ACTIVITY, WHICH PREVENTS COURSES FROM BECOMINGMERELY THEORETICAL. THE CHANGING STRUCTURE OF ACADEMIC LIBRARIES IS REFLECTEDIN THE SYLLABUSES OF LIBRARY SCHOOLS WHICH DEVOTE MORE TIME TO CURRENT LIBRARYAND INFORMATION SCIENCE SUBJECTS THAN BEFORE.
2538|ARCHIVIST AND COMPREHENSIVIST.     RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN TECHNOLOGY HAVE VASTLY EXPANDED THE ARCHIVAL REALM. THEARCHIVIST RISKS BEING OUT OF TUNE WITH THE NEEDS OF ELECTRONIC TIMES.

2542|EVEN AFTER 8| YEARS WITHIN THE COLLEGES OF TECHNOLOGY, LIBRARIANSHIP TRAININGIS STILL A CRISIS AREA.     ALTHOUGH NATIONAL GUIDELINES WERE DRAWN UP ON LIBRARIANSHIP TRAINING, EACHWEST GERMAN STATE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ITS OWN EDUCATION SYSTEM, THEREFORECONSIDERABLE VARIATIONS STILL EXIST CONCERNING LEGAL STATUS OF LIBRARYSCHOOLS, ENTRY REQUIREMENTS, CURRICULA FOR COMPULSORY AND OPTIONAL SUBJECTSAND ORGANISATION OF COURSES FOR PUBLIC AND ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS. SOME SUBJECTSARE NOT TAUGHT AT ALL IN SOME SCHOOLS AND GENERALLY RELATED SUBJECTS ARE SPLITUP TOO MUCH. MANY LECTURERS PLACE TOO MUCH EMPHASIS ON FORMAL LECTURES' MANYSTUDENTS ARE UNINTERESTED IN THEIR STUDIES. TRAINING COURSES MUST DEVELOPSTUDENTS' CRITICAL FACULTIES, ENCOURAGE CREATIVITY AND PROMOTE ACTIVECOMMUNICATION WITH READERS AND COOPERATION WITH OTHER INSTITUTIONS; BETTERORGANISATION AND MORE UNIFICATION AMONG LIBRARY SCHOOLS ARE REQUIRED.
2543|STUDENTS CRITICISE THE SITUATION CONCERNING TRAINING AT STUTTGART LIBRARYSCHOOL.     REPORT OF DISCUSSION AT A WEEKEND SEMINAR, STUTTGART, JAN 81|. MANY STUDENTSHAVE FINANCIAL PROBLEMS AND DIFFICULTIES IN FINDING ACCOMMODATION BUT,COMPARED WITH OTHER COURSES, FEW DROP OUT AND STUDENT-STAFF RELATIONSHIPS AREGOOD. LIBRARIANSHIP STUDIES SHOULD DEVELOP CRITICAL FACULTIES AND THE ABILITYTO MAKE CONTACT WITH READERS. THE LIBRARY MUST BECOME A COMMUNICATION CENTRE,UP TO DATE AND OPEN TO OUTSIDE INFLUENCES. REGIONAL NEEDS SHOULD BE EMPHASISEDRATHER THAN NATIONAL STANDARDISATION. LIBRARIANSHIP COURSES SHOULD CONTAIN NEWFIELDS OF STUDY, LIKE SOCIAL AND COMMUNICATION SCIENCES. SOME FORMAL LECTURESSHOULD BE REPLACED BY SMALL STUDY GROUPS, EXAMINATION PROCEDURES SHOULD BEIMPROVED AND BETTER USE MADE OF PRACTICAL TRAINING PERIODS.

REACTIONS OF LIBRARIANS TO RECENT PROPOSALS (TAKING ACCOUNT OF THE 1976|-77|REPORTS ON POSSIBLE ELEVATION TO UNIVERSITY STATUS) FOR A NEW CURRICULUM INTHE NORWEGIAN STATE LIBRARY SCHOOL. POINTS COVERED INCLUDE THE PROPOSED 2|-YEARCOMMON COURSE, WITH SPECIALISATION IN THE 3|RD YEAR (GENERALLY APPROVED);METHODS SUBJECTS (BIBLIOGRAPHY IS CONSIDERED NECESSARY, BUT SOME CONSIDERCOMPUTER STUDIES NOWADAYS EQUALLY ESSENTIAL); LITERATURE AND SOCIETY (THOUGHTTO MERIT MORE ATTENTION, ESPECIALLY CHILDREN'S LITERATURE, POPULAR LITERATURE,AND SERVICES TO HANDICAPPED AND IMMIGRANTS); INFORMATION SCIENCE (SHOULD BEINCLUDED IN 2| OR EVEN 3| YEARS); ADMINISTRATION (CONSIDERED ABSOLUTELYESSENTIAL); PRACTICAL TRAINING (SHOULD PROBABLY BE EXTENDED); EVALUATION OFSTUDENTS' WORK (GENERAL OPINION FAVOURS THE RETENTION OF MARKING TOGETHER WITHCONTINUOUS EVALUATION); LECTURING STAFF (LIBRARY EXPERIENCE IS PREFERRED TOACADEMIC SPECIALISATION); INTAKE OF STUD ENTS (AS FAR AS POSSIBLE SHOULD COVERTHE WHOLE COUNTRY). BETTER LIAISON ON EDUCATION BETWEEN SCHOOL AND LIBRARYPROFESSION IS FELT DESIRABLE, BUT THERE SEEMS NO MAJOR DISAGREEMENT BETWEENTHE CURRICULUM COMMITTEE AND LIBRARIANS IN THE FIELD.
2548|THIS ONE-SIDED PRAXIS-WORSHIP.     A NORWEGIAN STATE LIBRARY SCHOOL STUDENT REBUTS 3| CLAIMS MADE BY PREVIOUSWRITERS (SPECIAL SECTION ON LIBRARY EDUCATION IN NORWAY, 2|IBID1| 46| (8|) 1979|;2|SEE1| 81|/60|)' (1|) THAT LECTURERS HAVE TOO LITTLE PRACTICAL LIBRARY EXPERIENCE(&H HAVE EXTENSIVE LIBRARY EXPERIENCE, WHILE THE OTHERS MAINTAIN CONTACT WITHCURRENT LIBRARY PRACTICE); (2|) THAT THE COURSE CONTAINS TOO LITTLE PRACTICALTRAINING (THE NEW 3|-YEAR THEORETICAL CURRICULUM IS A STEP FORWARD. INTERNALAND EXTERNAL PRACTICAL WORK, THOUGH STILL NECESSARY, ARE OF LIMITED VALUE IN ACONSTANTLY DEVELOPING NATIONAL LIBRARY SYSTEM. THE SCHOOL'S PRIMARY TASK IS TOEDUCATE INDEPENDENT, CRITICAL LIBRARIANS WHO CAN EVALUATE THEIR ROLE IN ASOCIOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVE AND BE OPEN TO DEVELOPMENT AND CHANGE); AND (3|) THATINSTRUCTION IS TOO THEORETICAL (ON THE CONTRARY, THERE IS A TENDENCY TOOVER-VALUE DILIGENCE AND HARD WORK, VIEWING LIBRARIANSHIP AS A SERVICEINDUSTRY RATHER THAN A SCHOLARLY DISCIPLINE). A MORE LIBRARY /SOCIOLOGICAL-AND PROJECT-ORIENTED CURRICULUM IS NEEDED, CALLING FOR A DIFFERENT TYPE OFCOMMITMENT FROM BOTH STUDENTS AND LECTURERS.

2578|THE PEOPLE WANT PAP, OR IDEAS FOR AN ALTERNATIVE FORM OF LIBRARY WORK.     A YOUNG LIBRARIAN CHALLENGES HIS COLLEAGUES TO QUESTION THE ATTITUDE THAT THEYHAVE HELD TOWARDS THEIR WORK UNTIL NOW. PUBLIC LIBRARIES ARE AT PRESENT IN ABLIND ALLEY. LIBRARIANS HAVE FORGOTTEN THAT BOOKS ARE NOT SIMPLY THE SOURCESOF CERTAIN IDEAS' THEY ARE ALSO GOODS SUBJECT TO THE LAWS OF MARKETING, HENCETHE PREDOMINANCE OF BEST-SELLERS AND TRIVIAL MATERIAL ON THE MARKET. IT ISWRONG TO VALUE THE ABILITY TO READ ABOVE THAT OF PLAYING FOOTBALL; WHAT ISVITAL IS DISCRIMINATION AND SENSITIVITY TOWARDS THE ACTUAL CONTENTS OF THEMATERIAL READ.

IN SWEDEN TOO THERE IS A TENDENCY TOWARDS A UNIFIED LIBRARY SYSTEM.INSISTS THAT ALL LIBRARY TYPES SHOULD BE DEMOCRATICALLY CONTROLLED UNDER 1|MINISTRY; THE SEPARATIST ATTITUDE OF RESEARCH LIBRARIES IS THEREFOREREGRETTABLE. LIBRARIES SHOULD DEFINE THEIR USERS MORE BROADLY, NOW THAT THEEDUCATIONAL LEVEL OF THE POPULATION HAS RISEN AND USERS NEED MATERIAL AT ALLLEVELS. ECONOMIC CUTS NECESSITATE A UNIFIED SYSTEM TO DISTRIBUTE RESOURCES.USE OF THE NEW INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN LIBRARIES IS A QUESTION OF THESURVIVAL OF THE DEMOCRATIC LIBRARY, IT CAN REVOLUTIONISE RURAL LIFE AN DEDUCATION.

LIBRARY POLICY COULD BEALTERED, HOWEVER, THROUGH THE PERFORMANCE OF THE CENTRES' TASKS BY REGIONALLIBRARY ASSOCIATIONS. THESE ASSOCIATIONS SHOULD BE FORMED IN AREAS WHERE NONEEXIST; BASED ON A CONSTITUTION WORKED OUT BY LOCAL POLITICIANS, THEY CAN WORKTOWARDS IMPROVING SERVICE QUALITY.

THOSE INVOLVED IN TRAINING NEED SPECIALIST BOOKS ANDJOURNALS. IN HUNGARY, THESE CAN BE PURCHASED BY EVERYBODY, ALTHOUGH PURCHASEOF FOREIGN MATERIALS MAY BE FINANCIALLY DIFFICULT. LIBRARY BUDGETS SHOULDPERMIT THE PURCHASE OF EXPENSIVE BIBLIOGRAPHIES AND ABSTRACTING JOURNALS, ANDREFERENCE BOOKS, LIBRARIANS INSISTING ON THEIR CONTINUOUS ACQUISITION.FINANCIAL PROBLEMS MAY BE SOLVED BY BUDGETS WHICH FOLLOW PROPORTIONAL PRICEINCREASE, AND BY GOVERNMENTS WILLING TO REDUCE IMPORT PROFIT RATES OFMATERIALS FOR EDUCATION, RESEARCH AND MEDICAL TREATMENT.

LIBRARY COMMITTEES IN THESE AREAS SHOULD INCLUDE A REPRESENTATIVECROSS-SECTION OF THE SOCIAL AND CULTURAL LIFE OF THE COMMUNITY. COMMITTEEMEMBERS WITH LOCAL CONNECTIONS ARE MORE LIKELY TO UNDERSTAND THE CIRCUMSTANCESOF THE AREA. HOWEVER, WHERE THE LOCAL LIBRARY COMMITTEE INSISTS ON FOLLOWINGITS OWN POLICIES, THE COUNTY LIBRARY SYSTEM MAY BE PREVENTED FROM PURSUING ACOORDINATED POLICY FOR ALL LIBRARIES THROUGHOUT ITS REGION.

THE LIBRARY IS THE NATURAL POINT FOR COLLECTION OFMATERIAL ABOUT THE TWIN TOWNS AND FOR THE TRANSFER OF MATERIAL FROM THE HOMETOWN TO THE TWIN TOWNS. IT SHOULD ENCOURAGE READING OF THE NEIGHBOURINGCOUNTRIES' LITERATURE. DESCRIBES THE EXCHANGE AGREEMENTS BETWEEN JAMTLANDREGIONAL LIBRARY IN SWEDEN, AND SOUTH TRONDELAG LIBRARY ASSOCIATION AND THEREGIONAL LIBRARY IN TRONDHEIM, NORWAY. JOINT SEMINARS ON NORDIC LITERATURE AREHELD EVERY OTHER YEAR. IT IS HOPED EVENTUALLY TO EXTEND COOPERATION TO THEFINNISH AND DANISH TWIN TOWNS.

2681|APPROACHES TO FORECASTING DEMANDS FOR LIBRARY NETWORK SERVICES.     THE PROBLEM OF FORECASTING MONTHLY DEMANDS FOR LIBRARY NETWORK SERVICES ISCONSIDERED, ESPECIALLY IN TERMS OF USING FORECASTS AS INPUTS TO POLICYANALYSIS MODELS AND IN TERMS OF THE USE OF FORECASTS AS AN AID TO BUDGETINGAND STAFFING DECISIONS. FORECASTING METHODS CONSIDERED INCLUDE BOX-JENKINSTIME-SERIES METHODOLOGY, ADAPTIVE FILTERING, AND LINEAR REGRESSION. USINGDEMAND DATA FROM THE ILLINOIS LIBRARY AND INFORMATION NETWORK FOR 1971|-78|, ITIS SHOWN THAT FADING-MEMORY REGRESSION IS THE MOST APPROPRIATE METHOD, INTERMS OF BOTH ACCURACY AND EASE OF USE.

2683|TOWARDS AN ALTERNATIVE REGIONAL APPROACH TO LIBRARIES.     IN THE NETHERLANDS A CHANGE IN GOVERNMENT POLICY TOWARDS THE PROVISION OFREGIONAL LIBRARY SERVICES IS NOW BECOMING APPARENT. IN THE GOVERNMENT'S VIEWTHE INCREASING AVAILABILITY OF ON-LINE INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SERVICES WILLNECESSITATE THE CREATION OF A NETWORK OF WELL-STOCKED LIBRARIES IN EACHREGION. IN ORDER TO FINANCE SUCH A POLICY WHILST LOCAL AUTHORITIES ARESUFFERING SEVERE ECONOMIC RESTRAINTS, THE GOVERNMENT HAS SUGGESTED THAT LESSATTENTION SHOULD BE GIVEN TO THE RECREATIONAL FUNCTION OF PUBLIC LIBRARIES. INADDITION, RESEARCH BY THE BIBLIOTHEEKRAAD (LIBRARY ADVISORY COUNCIL) INTOINTERLIBRARY LENDING IN THE NETHERLANDS HAS SHOWN THAT THERE IS INSUFFICIENTCOOPERATION ON ACQUISITION POLICIES AMONGST THE LIBRARIES OF EACH REGION. INORDER TO BRING LIBRARIES TOGETHER IN CLOSER COOPERATION IT WILL BE NECESSARYTO OVERCOME THE RESISTANCE OF INDIVIDUAL LIBRARIANS AND TO CHANGE THE PRESENTLAW RELATING TO PUBLIC LIBRARIES.

2685|THE INVISIBLE LIBRARY.     ARGUES THAT THE NEGLECT OF PR ACTIVITIES BY PUBLIC LIBRARIES HAS LED TO ANINCREASING LACK OF UNDERSTANDING OF THEIR BASIC AIMS AMONG POLITICIANS AND ACONSEQUENT REDUCTION IN THEIR BUDGETS. THE LIBRARY SERVICE OCCUPIES A MODESTPLACE IN THE PUBLIC DEBATE COMPARED TO OTHER SECTORS BECAUSE IT HAS NOCOMPETITORS AND THE PUBLIC LACKS A BASIS FOR COMPARISON. LIBRARY MATTERS GETLITTLE PUBLICITY EITHER IN THE NATIONAL, LOCAL OR PROFESSIONAL PRESS. ACTIONSBY USER GROUPS, ESPECIALLY IF THESE ARE GENERALLY RESPECTED CITIZENS, CAN BEVERY EFFECTIVE AND CONTACT WITH ORGANISATIONS SUCH AS THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCEAND THE TRADE UNIONS SHOULD BE NURTURED BY THE LIBRARY. THIS COULD TAKE THEFORM OF 'FRIENDS OF THE LIBRARY GROUPS, AS FOUND LARGELY IN THE USA, OR, MOREIN LINE WITH DANISH PRACTICE, USER COUNCILS.

IT HAS HELPED TO BRINGABOUT THE LIBRARY SERVICES AND CONSTRUCTION ACT, WHICH HAS BEEN RESPONSIBLEFOR THE BUILDING OF MANY NEW LIBRARIES. BUT THE PASSING OF THE ACT DOES NOTENSURE ACTUAL PAYMENT OF GRANTS TO THE INDIVIDUAL STATES. FOR THIS TO HAPPEN,PERSISTENT LOBBYING OF THE CONGRESS COMMITTEE IS NECESSARY. THE OFFICE KEEPSINTERESTED CONGRESS REPRESENTATIVES INFORMED OF LIBRARY ISSUES, FOLLOWS THELEGISLATIVE PROCESS IN RELEVANT AREAS, AND BRIEFS MEMBERS BEFORE HEARINGS, BUTIT IS NOT ALLOWED, NOR DOES IT SEEK TO, GIVE FINANCIAL SUPPORT TO INDIVIDUALCANDIDATES' ELECTION CAMPAIGNS.

THEPROPOSAL FOR A NEW LIBRARY LAW WILL BE PRESENTED TO PARLIAMENT IN THEBEGINNING OF THE SESSION 1981|-82|, AND IT IS HOPED TO GET BROAD PARTY SUPPORTFOR IT. THE PROPOSAL SUGGESTS, NOT A JOINT DIRECTORATE, BUT LIBRARY MANAGEMENTWITH AN ADMINISTRATIVE LEADER RESPONSIBLE FOR TASKS COMMON TO PUBLIC ANDRESEARCH LIBRARIES AND INTERLENDING SERVICES. WOULD PREFER SCHOOL LIBRARIES TOBELONG UNDER THE EDUCATION MINISTRY, BUT THEY SHOULD CATER FOR LEISURE READINGAS WELL AS PROVIDING EDUCATIONAL RESOURCE MATERIAL. LIBRARIANS SHOULD BE LEFTTO FULFIL THE OBLIGATION OF COMPREHENSIVENESS IN BOOK SELECTION, AND LOCALPOLITICIANS SHOULD NOT EXERCISE ANY FORM OF CENSORSHIP PRIOR TO SELECTION.STANDS FIRM ON THE PRINCIPLE OF NO CHARGE FOR ANY LIBRARY SERVICES.

2696|INTERIM REPORT WITH MAJOR CONSEQUENCES FOR LIBRARIES.     THE LATEST INTERIM REPORT FROM THE NORWEGIAN JUEL COMMITTEE ON LOCALGOVERNMENT REFORM, 2|NEW FINANCE SYSTEM FOR COUNTY AUTHORITIES1|, COULDSERIOUSLY AFFECT PUBLIC LIBRARIES. IF ITS PROPOSALS ARE IMPLEMENTED, FINANCIALARRANGEMENTS BETWEEN STATE, COUNTY AND MUNICIPAL AUTHORITIES WILL BEABOLISHED, AND STATE SUBSIDIES GIVEN ONLY WHERE ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL. STATESUPPORT OF LIBRARIES AND CULTURAL ACTIVITIES IS CONSIDERED NEITHER DESIRABLENOR NECESSARY. THE STATE LIBRARY OFFICE, IN REPLY, CONSIDERS THE PRESENT STATEGRANTS VITAL IN OPERATING A SATISFACTORY LIBRARY SERVICE ACCORDING TO THELIBRARY ACT. LOCAL AUTHORITIES ARE NOT LEGALLY OBLIGED TO ADMINISTER COUNTYLIBRARIES; WITHOUT STATE SUPPORT, LIBRARIES MIGHT RECEIVE ONLY MINIMAL SUMS,LEADING AT WORST TO THE CLOSURE OF COUNTY LIBRARY SERVICES IN SOME COUNTIES.SINCE PUBLIC AND MOBILE LIBRARIES ARE NOWADAYS CLOSELY LINKED TO COUNTYLIBRARIES, THIS WOULD SERIOUSLY DAMAGE THE PROVISION OF  AN ADEQUATE NATIONALLIBRARY SERVICE.
2697|WILL THE STATE TAKE THE FINANCIAL BACKBONE OUT OF THE LIBRARY ACT?.     STATE GRANTS TO THE VEST-AGDER (NORWAY) COUNTY LIBRARY AMOUNTED IN 1980| TO 35|%OF ITS BUDGET. RECENT PROPOSALS BY THE JUEL COMMITTEE ON LOCAL GOVERNMENTREFORM WOULD MEAN THE WITHDRAWAL OF STATE SUPPORT. IF RESPONSIBILITY FORLIBRARY SERVICE DEVOLVES ENTIRELY ON LOCAL AUTHORITIES, THE NORWEGIAN PUBLICLIBRARY SYSTEM WILL BE THREATENED BY DISINTEGRATION, WITH NATIONAL LIBRARYDUTIES CONCENTRATED IN A FEW STATE-OWNED SPECIAL LIBRARIES. SINCE EVEN THEREVISED LIBRARY ACT OF 1971| DID NOT OBLIGE COUNTIES TO OPERATE A LIBRARYSERVICE, THE SYSTEM HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED AND DEVELOPED LARGELY THROUGH THEINFLUENCE AND SUPPORT OF CENTRAL AUTHORITY. THE BASIS FOR THE 1971| ACT WAS THELONG-STANDING REGIONAL IMBALANCE IN SCHOOL LIBRARY AND PUBLIC LIBRARYSTANDARDS.

2707|LIBRARIES AND COMPUTERS.     THE DEBATE ON COMPUTERS IN LIBRARIES CENTRES AROUND 2| QUESTIONS' WHETHERCOMPUTERS ON THE WHOLE ARE OF BENEFIT TO USERS, AND WHETHER THE BUMS SYSTEM INPARTICULAR IS OF VALUE. INTRODUCTION OF COMPUTERS MEANS THAT LIBRARY STAFFBECOME DEPENDENT ON EXPERTS. AS PROCESSES BECOME AUTOMATED THEY ALSO BECOMEDEHUMANISED, AND READERS USE MACHINES DIRECTLY WITH MINIMAL HELP FROM STAFF.SOME SKILLS ARE LOST AND REPLACED WITH ROUTINES. AS FOR THE BUMS SYSTEM, SOMEROUTINES HAVE MERELY REPLACED OTHERS. A TRADITIONAL CARD CATALOGUE IS EASIERTO USE THAN THE BUMS CATALOGUE, ALTHOUGH THE LATTER MAKES SURVEY OF THELIBRARY'S TOTAL STOCK POSSIBLE. BUT THIS LEADS IN TURN TO INCREASE IN THENUMBER OF REQUESTS WITHIN THE LIBRARY SYSTEM; IT FAVOURS THE ACTIVE,EXPERIENCED USERS, BUT DISCOURAGES THE INEXPERIENCED AND THE BROWSERS. THECOST OF GATHERING OF STATISTICS THROUGH THROUGH BUMS AND TRAINING OF STAFF INDATA TECHNOLOGY MUST BE SET AGAINST OTHER POSSIBLE USES OF THE RESOURCES.
2708|AS AMERICAN AS HAMBURGERS AND APPLE PIE.     SUMS UP THE IMPRESSIONS OF AUTOMATION IN US LIBRARIES. MOST LARGER LIBRARYSYSTEMS HAVE NOW AUTOMATED THEIR TECHNICAL PROCESSES, BUT AUTOMATION OF THEMORE COMPLICATED BIBLIOGRAPHIC ROUTINES, SUCH AS LITERATURE SEARCHING WHICHNECESSITATE UNIFORM AND WELL DEVELOPED CATALOGUING, IS NOT WIDESPREAD. THEPROCESS OF AUTOMATION STARTED IN THE 60|S SPURRED LARGELY BY THE GENERAL USOPENNESS TOWARDS TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENTS AND PRESSURE FROM COMMERCIALFIRMS. THE LACK OF INTERLIBRARY COOPERATION AND OF STANDARDISATION OF WORKROUTINES IN US PUBLIC LIBRARIES HAS ENCOURAGED THE ADOPTION OF AUTOMATIONSYSTEMS TAILOR-MADE TO INDIVIDUAL LIBRARIES. THE GENERAL IMPACT OF AUTOMATIONHAS NOT BEEN MUCH STUDIED, BUT THERE WAS AGREEMENT THAT COMPUTER TECHNOLOGYHAD LED TO CENTRALISATION, LESS INDEPENDENCE FOR BRANCHES, BETTERINTERLENDING, AND HAD FREED RESOURCES FOR OTHER SERVICES. ALTHOUGH FEWER STAFFTENDED TO BE EMPLOYED, NONE HAD BEEN DIRECTLY MADE REDUNDANT. NO COST-BENEFITANALYSES SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN CARRIED OUT. THE REACTIONS OF USERS, BOTH STAFFAND READERS, WERE LARGELY FAVOURABLE, EXCEPT PERHAPS IN BRANCH PUBLICLIBRARIES.

2710|PLANNING FOR NEW INFORMATION SYSTEMS.     LOW COST COMPUTING HARDWARE WITH INCREASINGLY SOPHISTICATED SOFTWARE ISPROVIDING OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW, OR THE REVISION OFEXISTING, INFORMATION SYSTEMS. THE PROCEDURES WHICH ARE INVOLVED IN THEPLANNING STAGE OF SUCH SYSTEMS HAVE BEEN INFLUENCED BY THE COSTS INVOLVED ANDTHE DECISION MAKING IS MORE IN THE HANDS OF THE DEPARTMENT OR UNIT WITHIN ANORGANISATION THAN IT WAS. A STAGED PROCEDURE WITH A CHECKLIST OF ACTIVITIES,APPROPRIATE DOCUMENTATION AND CONSIDERATIONS TO BE TAKEN AT EACH STAGE IS 1|WAY TO REDUCE THE CHANCES OF ERROR IN THE DECISIONS MADE IN THE PLANNINGPROCESS.
2711|THE PUBLIC LIBRARY AS PROMOTER OF TECHNO-FASCISM' THE (ANTI-)SOCIALCONSEQUENCES OF AUTOMATION.     MODERN SOCIETY IS DOMINATED BY SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY. HOWEVER, INSUFFICIENTATTENTION HAS BEEN PAID TO THE SOCIAL IMPLICATIONS OF AUTOMATION. THEPROFESSIONAL ORGANISATIONS OF LIBRARIANSHIP IN THE NETHERLANDS HAVE UNDERTAKENNO STUDIES OF THE SOCIAL IMPLICATIONS ON THEIR MEMBERS' BEHALF APART FROM THENETHERLANDS BIBLIOTHEEK EN LEKTUUR CENTRUM (DUTCH CENTRE FOR LIBRARIES ANDLITERATURE), WHICH IN 1979| FORMED A COMMITTEE TO INVESTIGATE WAYS OFPROTECTING THE PRIVACY OF THE INDIVIDUAL AGAINST THE MISUSE OF PERSONALINFORMATION IN COMPUTERISED SYSTEMS. HOWEVER, THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THECOMMITTEE WERE REJECTED IN 1980| BY NBLC MEMBERS AS TOO RADICAL. AUTOMATIONWILL LEAD TO A REDUCTION IN THE NUMBER OF POSTS IN LIBRARIES AT ALL LEVELS ANDLIBRARIANS MUST ACT NOW TO PREVENT A FURTHER DETERIORATION IN THE SITUATION.

2739|HOW TO INCREASE THE EFFICIENCY OF THE READERS' WORK IN THE LIBRARY.     AN IMPORTANT TASK OF THE 5|-YEAR-PLAN IS TO SAVE READERS' EXPENDITURE OF EFFORTIN USING LIBRARIES. COMPUTERISED CATALOGUES SHOW WIDE POTENTIAL. READERS'REQUESTS ARE TRANSMITTED TO LARGE LIBRARIES' BOOKSTORES ALONG T.V.COMMUNICATION CHANNELS. DOCUMENT REPRODUCTION HAS SIGNIFICANTLY LESSENEDREADERS' EXPENDITURE OF EFFORT. AUTOMATION OF ACQUISITIONING, CATALOGUING,INTERLIBRARY LOANS, SELECTIVE RETRIEVAL ALSO SAVE READERS' TIME. LARGELIBRARIES HAVE AUTOMATED SYSTEMS FOR ISSUING BIBLIOGRAPHIES, ABSTRACTS, UNIONCATALOGUES. LARGE INFORMATION-COMPUTER CENTRES WILL BE CREATED FOR COLLECTIVEUSE AS INFORMATION TRANSMISSION SYSTEMS. THE STATE AUTOMATED SCIENTIFIC ANDTECHNICAL INFORMATION SYSTEM SHOULD ECONOMISE ON LIBRARIANS' AND READERS'TIME' THE GOVERNING FACTORS IN LIBRARY AUTOMATION.

GOOD CHILDREN'S FILMS ARE IDEALFOR LIBRARY SHOWING AND CAN BE LINKED WITH BOOKS. NOT ALL LIBRARY PREMISES ARESUITABLE FOR FILM-SHOWS; THIS FACTOR SHOULD BE CONSIDERED IN PLANNING NEWLIBRARIES. LOAN OF FILMS SHOULD BE ADMINISTERED BY COUNTY LIBRARIES. ALLLIBRARIES SHOULD HAVE FILM CATALOGUES, POSSIBLY DISTRIBUTED BY THE STATELIBRARY OFFICE. THE ASSOCIATION OF CINEMATOGRAPHERS HOPE TO PURCHASE SEVERALSETS OF APPARATUS FOR USE IN SELECTED AREAS.
2828|CENTRALISED BOOK DISTRIBUTION-A TOPIC OF THE DAY.     A STRONG PLEA FOR ESTABLISHING A NEW, CENTRALISED ENTERPRISE TO SUPPLYLIBRARIES, ESPECIALLY PUBLIC LIBRARIES, WITH LITERATURE AND UP-TO-DATEEQUIPMENT. ENTERPRISE OF THAT KIND HAD BEEN ENVISAGED ALREADY IN THE STATUTEFOR THE NATIONAL NETWORK OF LIBRARIES IN BULGARIA. SIMILAR ORGANISATIONS HAVEBEEN IN OPERATION IN OTHER SOCIALIST COUNTRIES. THEY ARE OF INVALUABLEASSISTANCE TO LIBRARIANS, IN PARTICULAR THOSE IN SMALL LIBRARIES, WHO VERYOFTEN LACK THE NECESSARY QUALIFICATIONS IN LIBRARIANSHIP AND WORK ONLYPART-TIME. BOOKS ARE SELECTED, PURCHASED AND DISTRIBUTED TO LIBRARIES ALMOSTIMMEDIATELY AFTER THEY HAVE BEEN PUBLISHED, THE CATALOGUE CARDS WITHAPPROPRIATE ANNOTATIONS BEING DELIVERED AT THE SAME TIME. THUS, NEWACQUISITIONS ARE SELECTED EXPERTLY TO MAINTAIN THE PROPER RATIO BETWEENPOLITICAL, FICTIONAL AND SPECIAL MATERIAL. LIBRARIANS ARE BY THESE MEANSRELIEVED OF THE TEDIOUS AND TIME-CONSUMING TASK OF CATALOGUING, AND CAN DEVOTEMORE TIME TO THEIR READERS, TO THEIR IDEOLOGICAL EDUCATION AND TO PROFESSIONALADVANCEMENT.

2887|CHARTING OF DEWEY USERS IN NORWAY.     IN FEB 79| THE NORWEGIAN DEWEY COMMITTEE SENT A QUESTIONNAIRE TO 179| PUBLIC ANDSPECIAL LIBRARIES, ENQUIRING ABOUT THEIR USE OF DEWEY AND/OR ARNESEN(NORWEGIAN VERSION OF DEWEY); EDITIONS USED; SIZE OF COLLECTIONS;SUBJECT-HEADINGS LISTS USED; INDEXES REQUIRED; SUBJECT AREAS WHERE DEWEY DIDNOT MEET NORWEGIAN REQUIREMENTS; AND ADDITIONAL AIDS DESIRABLE. THE AIM WAS TOCHART NORWEGIAN USE OF DEWEY AND OBTAIN HELP TOWARDS A NEW EDITION OF ARNESENAND IN THE COMMITTEE'S FUTURE WORK. OF 117| LIBRARIES WHICH REPLIED, 77| USEDDEWEY AND/OR ARNESEN, MANY SUPPLEMENTING ARNESEN FROM OTHER SOURCES. SEVERALLIBRARIES SPECIFIED PROBLEM FIELDS, ARNESEN BEING FOUND WEAKEST IN CLASSES300|, 700| AND 900|. PROPOSALS INCLUDED MICROCARD INDEXES; CURRENT SUBJECT CARDCATALOGUES; CLASSIFICATION ON PUBLICATION; AND PERIODICAL PUBLICATION WITHCONTINUING UPDATING. THE SURVEY REVEALED A CLEAR NEED FOR A NEW, EXTENDEDEDITION OF ARNESEN, AND A LIKELY INCREASE IN INTEREST IN DEWEY, THE  STATELIBRARY COUNCIL HAVING RECOMMENDED DEWEY AND UDC AS NATIONAL CLASSIFICATIONPOLICY.
2888|DEWEY' THE NEGLECTED INTRODUCTION.     DEWEY'S INTRODUCTION HAS BEEN DROPPED FROM THE CURRENT 19|TH EDITION OF THECLASSIFICATION SCHEME. PERHAPS BECAUSE OF ITS ALLEGEDLY PHONETIC SPELLING ITHAS BEEN NEGLECTED. HOWEVER, SINCE IT IS CONSIDERED THAT THIS INTRODUCTIONSAYS EVERYTHING WHICH CAN BE SAID ABOUT LIBRARY CLASSIFICATION IT ISCONSIDERED THAT IT SHOULD NOT NOW BE FORGOTTEN. HOWEVER THE FAILURE TO RELATETHE THEORY IN THE INTRODUCTION TO THE ACTUAL ARRANGEMENT OF THE SUBJECTSWITHIN THE SCHEDULES SET THE UNFORTUNATE PATTERN BY WHICH LIBRARYCLASSIFICATION CAME TO BE DISCUSSED WITH LITTLE OR NO REFERENCE TO THE SUBJECTMATTER INVOLVED. THE FACT THAT DEWEY SURVIVES AS THE MOST WIDELY USEDCLASSIFICATION REFLECTS THE PHYSICAL DIFFICULTY OF TRYING TO RECLASSIFY ANYESTABLISHED LIBRARY AND THE LACK OF ANY NEW THINKING IN EDUCATIONAL CURRICULA.THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT LATER SCHEMES REPRESENT ANY WORTHWHILE ADVANCE ONDEWEY.
2889|DEWEY IN THE UK' A BRITISH VIEWPOINT.     BASED ON A PAPER GIVEN AT THE DEWEY DECIMAL CLASSIFICATION MEETING, 3| MAR 81|,UNIVERSITY COLLEGE LONDON (UK).

DISCUSSES THEJUSTICE OF COMPENSATING AN AUTHOR WHEN HIS BOOKS ARE USED; THE USE OF PLR TOENCOURAGE NATIVE AUTHORS; PLR ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA; INTERNATIONAL ASPECTS;EFFECTS OF EXTENDING THE SCOPE OF PLR TO ENCOMPASS ALL LIBRARIES AND ALSO BOOKUSE WITHIN LIBRARIES; PROBLEMS OF MEASURING BOOK USE; THE ROLE OF THECLEARINGHOUSE; FUNDING; LEVELS OF PAYMENT; COST OF PLR SCHEMES; PROCEDURES FORINTRODUCING A PLR SCHEME; AND POSSIBLE CONSEQUENCES OF PLR CONCERNING AUTHORS.
2993|POINTS OF VIEW OF LIBRARIANS' ALTERNATIVES TO PLR.     CONTRIBUTION TO A THEMATIC ISSUE ON PUBLIC LENDING RIGHT (PLR). LISTS THEMAJOR POINTS OF LIBRARIAN OPPOSITION TO PLR, FOCUSING ON THE QUESTIONS' DOAUTHORS HAVE NATURAL PROPRIETARY RIGHTS CONCERNING THEIR TEXTS; ARE LIBRARIESINFRINGING THESE RIGHTS; DO AUTHORS SUFFER FINANCIAL DAMAGE THROUGH LIBRARYCIRCULATION; WHAT ARE THE EFFECTS OF PLR ON LIBRARIES; AND WHO WILL REALLYBENEFIT FROM PLR. LIBRARIANS DO RECOGNISE THE FINANCIAL PLIGHT OF MOST AUTHORSAND HAVE SUGGESTED ALTERNATIVES TO PLR IN THE AREAS OF' CURTAILMENT OF LIBRARYPURCHASES; SPECIAL PRICING OF LIBRARY BOOKS; DIRECT TAX RELIEF; AUGMENTATIONOF ROYALTY INCOME; AND AUGMENTED PROGRAMMES OF LITERARY AWARDS.
2994|LEGAL ASPECTS OF PUBLIC LENDING RIGHT.     CONTRIBUTION TO A THEMATIC ISSUE ON PUBLIC LENDING RIGHT (PLR). MOST PLRPROPONENTS CONTENT THAT PLR LEGISLATION IS AN INTEGRAL PART OF COPYRIGHT LAW,BUT IN ONLY 1| OF THE 10| COUNTRIES TO ENACT PLR LEGISLATION HAS THE STATUTEBEEN MADE A PART OF COPYRIGHT LAW. THE PLR CONCEPT DOES NOT FIT NEATLY INTOTHE PRINCIPLES OF US COPYRIGHT LAW, BUT THE SUCCESSFUL DEVELOPMENT OF 2|DROITDE SUITE1| LEGISLATION (REQUIRING PAYMENT OF ROYALTIES TO ARTISTS FOR RESALE OFTHEIR WORKS) IN CALIFORNIA IS AN INDICATION THAT PLR IS A WORKABLE CONCEPT INTHE US LEGAL STRUCTURE.
2995|PUBLIC LENDING RIGHT' A HISTORY OF THE IDEA.     CONTRIBUTION TO AN ISSUE ON PUBLIC LENDING RIGHT (PLR). THE IDEA THAT ANAUTHOR IS ENTITLED TO BE COMPENSATED FOR THE MULTIPLE USES OF HIS COPYRIGHTEDBOOKS IN LIBRARIES IS RELATIVELY NEW, ONLY BEING DISCUSSED SINCE SHORTLYBEFORE 1920|. IDENTIFIES FACTORS THAT HAVE ENCOURAGED THE DEVELOPMENT ANDGROWTH OF THIS CONCEPT; OUTLINES THE ARGUMENTS ADVANED BY ITS PROPONENTS ANDOPPONENTS; BRIEFLY DESCRIBES PLR LEGISLATION IN SCANDINAVIA; AND TRACES THECAMPAIGN FOR LEGISLATION IN THE UK.
2996|THE SITUATION IN THE UNITED KINGDOM.     CONTRIBUTION TO A THEMATIC ISSUE ON PUBLIC LENDING RIGHT (PLR). OUTLINES THECASES FOR AND AGAINST PLR IN THE UK; THE ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION OF THE PLRCAMPAIGN; ATTEMPTS TO INTRODUCE PLR LEGISLATION IN PARLIAMENT; PROVISIONS OFTHE PUBLIC LENDING RIGHT ACT PASSED IN 1979|; AND MOVES TOWARDS THE ACT'SIMPLEMENTATION.
2997|SITUATION IN COUNTRIES OF CONTINENTAL EUROPE.     CONTRIBUTION TO A THEMATIC ISSUE ON PUBLIC LENDING RIGHT (PLR). OUTLINES THEPLR SCHEMES OPERATING IN DENMARK, NORWAY, SWEDEN, FINLAND, ICELAND, THENETHERLANDS, AND WEST GERMANY. ATTEMPTS TO ESTABLISH A JOINT PLR SCHEME INSCANDINAVIA, OR AT LEAST RECIPROCAL BILATERAL AGREEMENTS, HAVE BEENUNSUCCESSFUL. DENMARK, THE NETHERLANDS, AND WEST GERMANY ARE FACING THEPROBLEM OF MAINTAINING DIFFERENT SCHEMES WITHIN THE EUROPEAN ECONOMICCOMMUNITY (EEC). OF THESE 3|, ONLY WEST GERMANY HAS A PLR SCHEME WHICH ISWITHIN ITS COPYRIGHT LAWS AND WHICH DOES NOT OPERATE FOR THE BENEFIT OF ITSOWN CITIZENS. THE EEC PROHIBITS DISCRIMINATION ON GROUNDS OF NATIONALITY; THEEFFECT OF THIS ON PLR IS BEING DEBATED.
2998|PUBLIC LENDING RIGHT' THE SOUTH AFRICAN SCENE.     CONTRIBUTION TO A THEMATIC ISSUE ON PUBLIC LENDING RIGHT (PLR). IN SOUTHAFRICA, AUTHORS ARE NOT REMUNERATED FOR USE OF THEIR WORKS IN LIBRARIES AND,IN COMPARISON WITH MOST WESTERN COUNTRIES, VERY LITTLE IS BEING DONE BY THESTATE TO SUPPORT AUTHORS FINANCIALLY AND STIMULATE LOCAL BOOK PRODUCTION ANDLITERATURE. RELATIVELY FEW PUBLICATIONS ON PLR HAVE APPEARED AND THE AUTHORS'CAMPAIGN FOR A PLR SYSTEM HAS NOT YET GAINED MOMENTUM.
2999|THE SITUATION IN CANADA AND THE UNITED STATES.     CONTRIBUTION TO A THEMATIC ISSUE ON PUBLIC LENDING RIGHT (PLR). DISCUSSION ONPLR IS MUCH FURTHER ADVANCED IN CANADA THAN IN THE USA-AUTHORS' ANDLIBRARIANS' GROUPS HAVE ISSUED RESOLUTIONS AND MANIFESTOES; FORMAL DEBATESHAVE BEEN HELD; AND THE CANADA COUNCIL (A GOVERNMENTAL CORPORATION WHICHADMINISTERS GRANT PROGRAMMES FOR ARTISTS AND AUTHORS) IS DEVELOPING A MODELFOR COMPENSATING AUTHORS, BASED ON HOLDINGS OF THEIR WORKS BY LIBRARIES. GIVENTHE PRESENT POLITICAL CLIMATE IN THE USA, PLR ISSUES ARE NOT AS TIGHTLY DRAWNTHERE. MOST US LIBRARIANS ARE ONLY DIMLY AWARE OF PLR, BUT MILITANCY AMONGPROFESSIONAL AUTHORS IS GROWING.
3000|PUBLIC LENDING RIGHT' THE AMERICAN AUTHOR'S VIEWPOINT.     CONTRIBUTION TO A THEMATIC ISSUE ON PUBLIC LENDING RIGHT (PLR). PLR FACESOBSTACLES THAT MAY WELL KEEP IT FROM US SHORES FOR A LONG TIME. A SAMPLING OFUS AUTHORS INDICATES THAT THEY ARE WELL AWARE OF THIS, BUT HARBOUR ANATTRACTION TO PLR THAT MAY BLOSSOM INTO THE KIND OF SUPPORT THE CONCEPT HASFOUND ELSEWHERE. THIS MAY GIVE PLR A RING OF INEVITABILITY.
3001|PUBLIC LENDING RIGHT' SITUATION IN NEW ZEALAND AND AUSTRALIA.     CONTRIBUTION TO A THEMATIC ISSUE ON PUBLIC LENDING RIGHT (PLR). NEW ZEALANDAND AUSTRALIA INTRODUCED PLR SCHEMES IN 1973| AND 1974| RESPECTIVELY. THERE WASNO COOPERATION AND THE SCHEMES ARE DISSIMILAR. OUTLINES THE QUALIFICATIONRULES FOR AUTHORS AND WORKS IN EACH SCHEME. UNLIKE AUSTRALIA, NEW ZEALAND DOESNOT MAKE PAYMENTS TO PUBLISHERS AND THE SCHEME'S INTRODUCTION INVOLVED CLOSECOOPERATION BETWEEN AUTHORS AND LIBRARIANS. IN AUSTRALIA, PAYMENTS ARE THESAME AS IN 1973| DESPITE AN INCREASE IN THE CONSUMER PRICE INDEX OF NEARLY 100|%AND DESPITE MANY ATTEMPTS TO INCREASE PAYMENTS.
3002|VIDEODISC-THE PROGRAMMING REALITIES.     THE WORK OF THE NEBRASKA VIDEODISC DESIGN/PRODUCTION GROUP, WHICH HAS PRODUCED33| DIFFERENT VIDEO DISC PROGRAMMES, IS REVIEWED AND THE PREMASTERING SERVICEWHICH THE GROUP OFFERS, COVERING ALL STEPS UP TO, BUT NOT INCLUDING, ACTUALVIDEO DISC MASTERING IS DESCRIBED. 3| BASIC LEVELS OF INTERACTIVE CAPABILITYFOR VIDEO DISC PLAYERS AND PLAYER SYSTEMS ARE IDENTIFIED AND THE POTENTIAL ATEACH LEVEL FOR INTERACTIVITY IS ASSESSED.
3003|DIAL-A-SLIDE SERVICE FOR PRODUCERS.     DESCRIBES THE VISUAL RESOURCES SYSTEM DEVELOPED BY THE UK COMPANY MARTAK FORITS COLLECTION OF OVER 50|,000| SLIDES. A CUSTOMER'S REQUIREMENTS ARE RUNAGAINST THE COMPUTERISED INDEX AND THE COMPUTER SELECTS AND DISPLAYS DETAILSOF THE MOST APPROPRIATE SLIDE. A COPY OF THE SLIDE IS MADE AND DESPATCHED.MOST USERS ARE PRODUCERS OF TAPE/SLIDE PRESENTATIONS. MARTAK IS HOPING TOSERVICE THE COLLECTIONS OF OTHER COMPANIES AND IS TO MARKET A LESS COMPLEXVERSION OF THE SOFTWARE, ENABLING COMPANIES TO SORT OUT THEIR COLLECTIONSTHEMSELVES.
3004|A STUDY OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE FEED-BACK ABILITY AND THE DENSITY ANDRESOLUTION OF THE MICROFILM (IN CHINESE).     SUCCESSFUL DUPLICATION OF MICROFILMS DEPENDS ON, 2|INTER ALIA1|, THE DENSITY ANDRESOLUTION OF THE MICROFILMS. COMPARES THE MICROFILMING QUALITY REQUIREMENTSOF DOCUMENTS CONTAINING BOTH CHINESE CHARACTERS AND ROMAN LETTERS ANDDOCUMENTS CONTAINING ROMAN LETTERS ONLY.
3005|THE RESOLUTION POWER OF MICROFILMS (IN CHINESE).     IN ORDER TO HAVE A DEEPER UNDERSTANDING OF THE INFLUENCE OF RESOLUTION POWERON MICROFILMS, DESCRIBES THE DETERMINING METHODS OF RESOLUTION POWER FOR FILMMANUFACTURING AND USER'S APPLICATION. THE EXPRESSION OF RESOLUTION POWER BYLINES PER MIN IS SOMETIMES CONFUSING, SO THE METHOD READABLE BY THE PATTERNFROM THE NBS RESOLUTION TEST CHART 1010|A REGARDLESS OF THE REDUCTION RATIO HASBEEN INTRODUCED. FURTHERMORE, USING THE QUALITY INDEX CHART, IT IS POSSIBLE TOUNDERSTAND THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE RESOLUTION POWER REQUIRED TO MICROFILMTHE ORIGINALS CONTAINING ONLY ROMANIC LETTERS AND THOSE CONTAINING CHINESECHARACTERS, WHICH ARE MUCH MORE COMPLICATED IN STRUCTURE.
3006|WHEN MONEY IS SCARCE CULTURAL LIFE MUST GROW.     INTERVIEWS INGAR BECKMAN-HIRSCHFELDT, CHAIRMAN OF THE SWEDISH PUBLICLIBRARIANS' UNION (SFF) IN CONNECTION WITH A CAMPAIGN ORGANISED BY DIK(DOCUMENTATION, INFORMATION, CULTURE), AN UMBRELLA ORGANIZATION OF 8|ASSOCIATIONS, OF WHICH SFF IS A MEMBER. THE CAMPAIGN AIMS TO PUT PRESSURE ONPOLITICIANS UP TO THE TIME OF LOCAL AND GENERAL ELECTIONS IN 1982| ANDDEMONSTRATE THE CONSEQUENCES OF CUTS; A DISCUSSION BOOK DESCRIBING THE PRESENTSTATE OF CULTURAL INSTITUTIONS AND STATING ALTERNATIVES WHICH WOULD GIVEHIGHER PRIORITY TO CULTURE IS TO BE PUBLISHED. PUBLIC OPINION IS TO BEMOBILISED AND A CULTURAL PROGRAMME FOR DIK DRAWN UP. ALTHOUGH NO SECTION OFTHE CAMPAIGN IS AIMED SPECIFICALLY AT LIBRARIES, DEMAND FOR A LIBRARY LAW TOENSURE REASONABLE AND UNIFORM STANDARDS WILL BE MADE. CUTS IN CULTURALSERVICES ARE UNACCEPTABLE TO DIK AND LIBRARIANS ARE URGED NOT TO COOPERATE INSUGGESTING CUTS IN SERVICES AND MANPOWER. SFF EXPECTS LITTLE FROM THE PUBLICLIBRARY COMMISSION, ON WHICH IT IS NOT REPRESENTED.
3007|AN ANALYSIS OF THE METHODS USED TO CONVEY INFORMATION ON COMPLEX BIOCHEMICALSTRUCTURES, BY REPRESENTATIONS AND CODING SYSTEMS.     (MSC THESIS.) REPRESENTATIONS ARE VITAL FOR THE COMMUNICATION OF PROTEINSTRUCTURAL INFORMATION. THESE REPRESENTATIONS CAN BE CLASSIFIED ACCORDING TOBIOCHEMICAL STRUCTURE, AND VARY IN COMPLEXITY AND METHOD OF PRODUCTION. MANYTYPES OF REPRESENTATION ARE NECESSARY TO FULLY DOCUMENT A PROTEIN STRUCTURE.INVESTIGATES THE PRIMARY LITERATURE OF PROTEIN STRUCTURE, AND THE METHODS USEDBY BIOCHEMICAL AND CHEMICAL DATA BASES IN HANDLING PROTEIN STRUCTURES.EXPLORES ASPECTS OF NOMENCLATURE OF PROTEINS AND CODING SYSTEMS FOR PROTEINS,AND THE SUITABILITY OF NOERR STRUCTURES FOR STORING BIOCHEMICAL STRUCTURE.

THERAPEUTIC VALUE AND SIDE-EFFECTS OF, AND NECESSITY FOR DRUGS IN HUNGARY ARESUPERVISED BY THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF PHARMACY, WITH CIRCULATION AUTHORISEDBY THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH. REGISTRATION IS CARRIED OUT BY THE NATIONALINSTITUTE, WHICH ALSO DETERMINES THE QUALITATIVE REQUIREMENTS OF THE PRODUCTAND CONFIRMS THE FACTORY'S USE AND DOSAGE INSTRUCTIONS. DRUG DOCUMENTATION ISHANDED OVER AFTER PRECLINICAL AND CLINICO-PHARMACOLOGICAL EXAMINATIONS, ANDINCLUDES ANTECEDENTS OF THE ACTIVE AGENTS AND VEHICLES, AND DATA ON TOXICITY,AND CARCINOGENIC AND MUTAGENOUS PROPERTIES. REGISTRATION IS AN IMPORTANTFACTOR FOR EXPORT-MOST COUNTRIES REGISTER HUNGARIAN DRUGS ONLY AFTER THEY HAVEBEEN REGISTERED ALREADY IN HUNGARY. FOREIGN ACKNOWLEDGEMENT AND CIRCULATION OFA DRUG REQUIRE KNOWLEDGE ON REGISTRATION PRESCRIPTIONS IN THE PARTNERCOUNTRIES.
3009|THE EVOLUTION OF AN INTERNATIONAL LIBRARY AND BIBLIOGRAPHIC COMMUNITY.     CONTENDS THAT THE PRESENT FAR-REACHING SCOPE AND VARIETY OF BIBLIOGRAPHIC ANDLIBRARY ACTIVITY AT THE INTERNATIONAL LEVEL, AS MANIFESTED IN THE WORK OF MANYDIFFERENT KINDS OF INTERNATIONAL ORGANISATION, ARE POSSIBLE ONLY BECAUSE OFTHE EMERGENCE AFTER WORLD WAR I OF AN INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY WHICH DID NOTPREVIOUSLY EXIST. SUGGESTS WHY, IN THE PROFESSION OF LIBRARIANSHIP, THE LEAGUEOF NATIONS ORGANIZATION FOR INTELLECTUAL COOPERATION BECAME THE SYMBOL OF ANDCENTRE FOR THIS COMMUNITY RATHER THAN THE PALAIS MONDIAL OR MUNDANEUM, CREATEDBY PAUL OTLET AND HENRI LAFONTAINE IN BRUSSELS OVER 20| YEARS BEFORE.

A RESOLUTION AGAINST THE INTRODUCTION OF LENDINGFEES AND FOR A LIBRARY LAW WAS REJECTED AS UNANI MITY AMONG REPRESENTATIVESWAS LACKING.
3014|ROLE OF SCIENTIFIC LIBRARIES IN THE NATIONAL INFORMATION SYSTEM.     IN THE 1980|S, BULGARIAN LIBRARIES MUST MEET THE COMMUNIST PARTY REQUIREMENTSTO BECOME IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTORS NOT ONLY TO THE COUNTRY'S TECHNOLOGICALPROGRESS BUT ALSO TO THE POPULATION'S AESTHETIC EDUCATION. TO BECOME EQUALPARTNERS IN THE NATIONAL INFORMATION SYSTEM, SCIENTIFIC LIBRARIES HAVE TOREASSESS THE POTENTIAL FOR, AND THE MEANS OF IMPLEMENTING LIBRARY COOPERATIONAND COORDINATION IN RESPECT OF BUILDING UP THEIR BOOK COLLECTIONS. ACQUISITIONOF PUBLICATIONS AND PERIODICALS FROM THE CAPITALIST COUNTRIES MUST, INPARTICULAR, BE PLANNED VERY CAREFULLY CONSIDERING THE FOREIGN CURRENCYRESOURCES. ON THE OTHER HAND, LIBRARIES MUST CONSIDER AS THE 1|ST AND FOREMOSTDUTY THE DISSEMINATION OF INFORMATION REGARDING THE ACHIEVEMENTS OF THE USSRAND OTHER SOCIALIST COUNTRIES FROM WHICH PUBLICATIONS ARE FREELY AVAILABLE.INTERLIBRARY LENDING MUST BE BACKED UP AND EXPEDITED BY EFFICIENT TELEX ANDPHOTOCOPYING SERVICES.

3031|SHODDY AND PERNICIOUS BOOKS AND YOUTHFUL PURITY' LITERARY AND MORALCENSORSHIP, THEN AND NOW.     PAPER PRESENTED AT THE 41|ST CONFERENCE OF THE GRADUATE LIBRARY SCHOOL,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO, 16|-17| MAY 80|, CHILDREN'S ACCESS TO SERVICES ANDMATERIALS IN SCHOOL AND PUBLIC LIBRARIES. THOUGH SOME LIBRARIANS AND TEACHERSBELIEVE CENSORSHIP IS A RECENT PHENOMENON, IT HAS BEEN A PART OF LIBRARIANS'LIVES FOR MORE THAN A CENTURY. INDEED, MANY LATE-19|TH CENTURY LIBRARIANSREGARDED THEMSELVES PRIMARILY AS CENSORS, DUTY-BOUND TO PROTECT THE YOUNG FROMSHODDY AND PERNICIOUS BOOKS, ESPECIALLY FICTION. SOME LIBRARIANS AND TEACHERSTODAY CARRY ON THIS CENSORIAL TRADITION BY CIRCULATING OR TEACHING ONLY WORKSOF HIGH LITERARY MERIT OR THE PROPER MORAL CONTENT. THOSE CENSORING ONLITERARY GROUNDS OFTEN PROVIDE ONLY SUBJECTIVE CRITERIA, JUSTIFYING CENSORSHIPBY THEIR OWN PERSONAL TASTES. THOSE CENSORING ON MORAL GROUNDS OFTEN PROVIDENO BETTER CRITERIA, JUSTIFYING CENSORSHIP BY THEIR OWN PERSONAL MORALITY. LIBRARIANS AND TEACHERS HAVE NO RIGHT TO IMPOSE PERSONAL LITERARY OR MORALSTANDARDS ON THE PUBLIC, YOUNG OR OLD. THEY HAVE A DUTY TO PROVIDE MATERIALSOF ALL SORTS TO ALLOW CLIENTS AND STUDENTS TO SEARCH THROUGH AND SEEK OUTIDEAS.

3033|MEMEX' AS AN IMAGE OF POTENTIALITY IN INFORMATION RETRIEVAL RESEARCH ANDDEVELOPMENT.I     N 1945|, VANNEVAR BUSH WROTE AN ARTICLE URGING SCIENTISTS TO TURN TO THE TASKOF MAKING THE GROWING STORE OF KNOWLEDGE MORE ACCESSIBLE. (AS WE MAY THINK,2|ATLANTIC MONTHLY1| 176| (1|) 101|-108|). ONE DEVICE IN PARTICULAR WHICH HE URGEDFOR DEVELOPMENT WAS THE MEMEX-'A MACHINE THAT SHOULD BE AN EXTENSION OF THEPERSONAL MEMORY AND BODY OF KNOWLEDGE BELONGING TO AN INDIVIDUAL, AND SHOULDWORK IN A FASHION ANALOGOUS TO THE WORKING OF THE HUMAN BRAIN-BY ASSOCIATIONRATHER THAN BY CATEGORICAL CLASSIFICATION'. ASSESSES THE IMPACT OF BUSH'SIDEAS ON THE FIELD OF INFORMATION RETRIEVAL, USING BOTH QUANTITATIVE ANDQUALITATIVE ANALYSIS. THE 1945| ARTICLE HAS BEEN WIDELY CITED AND HAS BEEN USEDAS A SYMBOL FOR A NUMBER OF CONCEPTS.
3034|INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND THE SCIENCE OF INFORMATION.     IN DEALING WITH THEORIES OF INFORMATION RATHER THAN OF DOCUMENTATION, ONENEEDS TO USE THE SAME LOGARITHMIC MEASURES IN INFORMATION RETRIEVAL AS AREUSED IN THE ANALYSIS OF THE INTERNAL INFORMATION PROCESSES OF THE COMPUTER.ONE WOULD THEN BE DEALING WITH INFORMATION OBJECTIVELY THROUGHOUT, RATHER THANA MIX OF OBJECTIVE AND SUBJECTIVE MEASURES. INFORMATION 2|PER SE1| IS AN EMPTYCONCEPT. MAN NEEDS TO LEARN HOW TO RELATE INFORMATION MORE DIRECTLY TOKNOWLEDGE, AS A 1|ST STEP OBSERVING THE GROWTH OF KNOWLEDGE STRUCTURES INCOMPACT FIELDS OF SCIENCE. A FIRMER METAPHYSIC FOR SUCH STUDIES IS NEEDED.
3035|GOVERNMENTS COME AND GO-ALA REMAINS.     DESCRIBES THE AMERICAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION. IT WAS FOUNDED IN 1876| AND HAS35|,000| MEMBERS IN THE USA AND CANADA.

ITSPUBLICATIONS ILLUSTRATE THE WIDE COVERAGE OF ITS ACTIVITIES' CATALOGUINGRULES, LIBRARY PLANNING, EDUCATION, AUTOMATION, PR MATERIAL. IT DOES NOT ACTAS A TRADITIONAL TRADE UNION, BUT THE PRESSURE ON ITS OFFICE FOR LIBRARYPERSONNEL RESOURCES TO TAKE UP THE MATTER OF UNEQUAL PAY IS STRONG, ESPECIALLYFROM YOUNGER WOMEN, AND THE OFFICE IS NOW PUBLISHING ANNUAL SURVEYS OFSALARIES. IN LINE WITH THIS, THE ALA IS BOYCOTTING STATES WHO HAVE NOTRATIFIED THE EQUAL RIGHTS AMENDMENT, A DECISION WHICH HAS CAUSED FRICTION INTHE ASSOCIATION. ALTHOUGH THE REAGAN ADMINISTRATION HAS MEANT CUTS FORLIBRARIES, THE ALA IS CONFIDENT THAT IT CAN RIDE THE STORM.

3154|THE CURRENT STAGE OF INTER-DEPARTMENTAL LIBRARY COOPERATION.     STAGES IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF INTER-LIBRARY COOPERATION IN THE USSR CAN BETRACED OVER THE LAST 30| YEARS. COOPERATION IS OF 3| TYPES' WITHIN THE FRAMEWORKOF A DEPARTMENT; INVOLVING LIBRARIES FROM SEVERAL DEPARTMENTS BUT ON THE SAMESITE OR IN THE SAME ECONOMIC FIELD; OR WITHOUT ANY SUCH BOUNDARIES. THE KEYELEMENT IS INTEGRATION' THE PLANNED COMBINATION OF RESOURCES FROM DIFFERENTLIBRARIES TO ENSURE THEIR EFFECTIVE EXPLOITATION. THIS IS THE BASIS FOR THEFORMATION OF A REGIONAL LIBRARY NETWORK. IN THE LONG-TERM, SUCH INTEGRATEDSYSTEMS WILL HAVE AN INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT ROLE TO PLAY IN SOVIETLIBRARIANSHIP.

3167|MALPRACTICE LIABILITY' MYTH OR REALITY.     MALPRACTICE MAY BE DEFINED AS ANY PROFESSIONAL MISCONDUCT OR UNREASONABLE LACKOF SKILL IN THE PERFORMANCE OF PROFESSIONAL DUTIES THROUGH INTENTIONALCARELESSNESS OR SIMPLE IGNORANCE. ARGUES THAT LIBRARIANS AS PROFESSIONALSCOULD POSSIBLY BE SUED FOR MALPRACTICE, ALTHOUGH SUCH A CASE HAS NOT YETOCCURRED. SUGGESTS MEANS BY WHICH LIBRARIANS MAY HELP TO AVOID THE POSSIBILITYOF MALPRACTICE. CONCLUDES THAT THE LIBRARY PROFESSION MUST MAKE RENEWEDEFFORTS TOWARD IMPROVING THE COMPETENCY OF THE PROFESSIONAL PRACTITIONER.

DISCUSSES 3| ASPECTS OF THE ACADEMIC LIBRARY MANAGER'S RESPONSIBILITY' MANAGINGRELATIONS OF THE LIBRARY WITH THE REST OF THE INSTITUTION (INVOLVING THELIBRARY IN THE FORMULATION AND IMPLEMENTATION OF INSTITIONAL OBJECTIVES);MANAGING CONFLICTS WITHIN THE LIBRARY (THE MOST APPROPRIATE ATTITUDE BEING ACONSULTATIVE ADMINISTRATIVE STYLE DISTINGUISHED BY THE DEVELOPMENT OFAUTHORITY RATHER THAN RELIANCE ON LEGISLATED POWER); AND MANAGING CHANGESWROUGHT BY TECHNOLOGY (PERCEIVING TECHNOLOGY AS A MORE EFFICIENT MEANS FOROBTAINING THE LIBRARY'S TRADITIONAL GOALS).
3170|METHODOLOGICAL GUIDANCE TO LIBRARIES.     THE AIM OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY OF BULGARIA IS TO TRANSFORM ALL BULGARIANCITIZENS INTO HARMONIOUS PERSONALITIES. THIS EFFORT REQUIRES SUBSTANTIALPARTICIPATION BY LIBRARIES, BOTH PUBLIC AND SPECIAL. THE NUMBER OF READERS ANDFREQUENCY OF LOANS MUST BE MONITORED. THUS LIBRARIANS MUST BECOME FAMILIAR NOTONLY WITH THEIR READERS' INTERESTS BUT ALSO WITH THE DETAILS OF THE LITERATUREPRESENTED TO THEM. LIBRARIANS MUST NOT BE LEFT ALONE BUT ASSISTED AND GUIDEDEVEN MORE THAN BEFORE BY EXPERT ADVISERS, WORKING IN PARTICULAR AT THEMETHODOLOGICAL CENTRES OF REGIONAL CENTRAL LIBRARIES. THEIR WORK MUST BEADAPTED TO THE NEW, MUCH MORE COMPLICATED REQUIREMENTS OF THE 1980|S AND BEMORE EFFICIENT, TOO. BUREAUCRACY AND FORMALISM HAVE TO BE ELIMINATED,ACTIVITIES MUCH BETTER COORDINATED. THE CYRIL AND METHODIUS NATIONAL LIBRARYIN SOFIA MUST RETAIN LEADERSHIP IN THIS FIELD.
3171|SERIAL COST EFFICIENCY-A MODEL AND CASE STUDY (IN HEBREW).     HIGH RATE INFLATION IN PERIODICAL SUBSCRIPTION PRICES WITHOUT ADEQUATE BUDGETINCREMENTS FORCE MANY LIBRARIES TO FREEZE NEW SUBSCRIPTIONS AND IN MANY CASESTO CANCEL SUBSCRIPTIONS. THE PROCESS OF DESELECTION RAISES THE QUESTION OFWHICH TITLES WILL BE RETAINED AND WHICH WILL BE DISCONTINUED. SUGGESTS THATTHE EVALUATION OF THE RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF THE VARIOUS TITLES WILL BE DONEBY USING A COST EFFICIENCY FORMULA. THE FORMULA COMBINES 2| FACTORS, THE PRICEOF SUBSCRIPTION AND THE MEASURED USE OF THE JOURNAL, AND RANKS PERIODICALS INA GIVEN COLLECTION IN A DESCENDING ORDER' AT THE TOP WILL BE THE MOSTCOST-EFFICIENT TITLE AND AT THE BOTTOM THE LEAST COST-EFFICIENT TITLE. THISFORMULA WAS TRIED IN CONJUNCTION WITH A USE STUDY OF THE JUDAICA READINGROOM'S OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES DURING 1978|.
3172|LIBRARY SYSTEMS ANALYSIS 2|' PLANNING TECHNIQUES.     THE SYSTEMS ANALYST MUST 1|ST LEARN EVERYTHING ABOUT THE PRESENT SYSTEM AND ITSSHORTCOMINGS, THEN FIND OUT WHAT IS NEEDED TO OVERCOME THESE SHORTCOMINGS.BRIEFLY DISCUSSES THE TECHNIQUES OF INTERVIEWING, INPUT/OUTPUT ANALYSIS,OBSERVATION AND DATA RECORDING.
3173|SOME THOUGHTS ON THE FINANCING OF LIBRARIES.     ARGUES THAT SAVING MONEY FOR THE UNIVERSITY BY CUTTING ITS LIBRARY BUDGET ISCOUNTERPRODUCTIVE. THE ARGUMENT IS APPLIED TO SUCH AREAS AS STAFF CUTS ANDPROCESSING BACKLOGS, SERIOUS REDUCTIONS IN SERVICE LEADING TO UNDERMINING OFTHE LIBRARY'S SUPPORTIVE ROLE FOR THE UNIVERSITY'S TEACHING AND RESEARCHFUNCTION. ARGUES THAT RATIONALISATION OF SUBJECT INTERESTS AND SUBJECTS TAUGHTBY THE UNIVERSITIES IN AN AREA SHOULD LEAD TO MORE EFFICIENT USE OF RESOURCES.
3174|THE RESEARCH LIBRARIES ARE LIMPING SADLY BEHIND-SHOWS NEW REPORT ON THECONDITIONS OF RESEARCH IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR.     ACCORDING TO A REPORT ISSUED IN APRIL 81| BY THE RESEARCH SECRETARIAT, DENMARKLAGS BEHIND OTHER EUROPEAN COUNTRIES IN ITS SUPPORT FOR RESEARCH, BOTH PUBLICAND PRIVATE. THE REPORT DEALS SEPARATELY WITH RESEARCH LIBRARIES AND DESCRIBESTHE CONSEQUENCES OF THE CUTS BOTH FOR LIBRARIES AND THEIR MOTHER INSTITUTIONS;IT SHOWS THAT THE LIBRARIES USE LESS THAN 10|% OF THE EXPENDITURE ON RESEARCH.INCLUDES COMMENTS ON THE REPORT BY THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THE JOINTCOUNCIL OF RESEARCH LIBRARIES. THE COMMITTEE SUPPORTS THE CONCLUSION THAT THERESEARCH LIBRARIES' ECONOMIC PROBLEMS SHOULD BE SOLVED IN CONJUNCTION WITH,AND PREFERABLY BEFORE, ANY CHANGE IN THEIR STRUCTURE AND MANAGEMENT. IT POINTSOUT THAT FIGURES FOR RUNNING COSTS OF RESEARCH LIBRARIES UNDER THE CULTURALMINISTRY, AFTER ADJUSTMENT, SHOW A GREATER FALL THAN OF THOSE UNDER THEEDUCATION MINISTRY.
3175|LIBRARIANSHIP IN THE UNDERDEVELOPED COUNTRIES.     PAPER PRESENTED AT A CONFERENCE ON READING MATERIALS FOR LIBRARY EDUCATION,WEST BERLIN, 15|-20| DEC 80|. IN THE UNDERDEVELOPED COUNTRIES THE AVERAGE CITIZENIS POOR AND ILLITERATE AND 90|% OF THE POPULATION LIVES IN RURAL AREAS, WHERETRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATION SERVICES ARE EXTREMELY LIMITED. IN MOSTUNDERDEVELOPED COUNTRIES THE FINANCIAL BUDGET ALLOCATED TO LIBRARY STAFF ANDBOOKSTOCK IS EXTREMELY LIMITED. IN ADDITION, IN SOME COUNTRIES CONSIDERABLESUMS HAVE BEEN SPENT ON THE CONSTRUCTION OF CITY LIBRARIES TO U.K. AND U.S.A.STANDARDS WITH A CONSEQUENT REDUCTION IN FUNDS FOR RURAL AREAS. THE AVAILABLERESOURCES SHOULD BE DIVIDED MORE EVENLY TO PROVIDE IMPROVED SERVICESTHROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE COUNTRY.
3176|ANDREW CARNEGIE'S ROLE IN AMERICAN PUBLIC LIBRARY DEVELOPMENT.     (PHD DISSERTATION-UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN). OVER $40| MILLION IN CARNEGIE GRANTSWAS DONATED TO 1|,412| US COMMUNITIES BETWEEN 1886| AND 1917|.

3177|THE AUSTRALIAN AND NEW ZEALAND RESPONSE TO CCNY GRANTS FOR LIBRARY DEVELOPMENT.     AUSTRALIAN AND NEW ZEALAND LIBRARIANSHIP HAD MUCH IN COMMON IN THE 1930|S,STEMMING FROM A COMMON UK TRADITION, YET EACH COUNTRY MADE QUITE A DIFFERENTRESPONSE TO THE CARNEGIE CORPORATION OF NEW YORK AID PROGRAMME TO STIMULATELIBRARY DEVELOPMENT. THE NEW ZEALAND RESPONSE WAS MUCH MORE POSITIVE AND MANYDEVELOPMENTS TOOK PLACE IN THE 1930|S-40|S; IN AUSTRALIA, SOME EQUIVALENTDEVELOPMENTS WERE NOT ACCOMPLISHED UNTIL THE 1960|S. EXAMINES THE REASONS FORTHIS.
3178|ON THE QUESTION OF CHARGING FOR PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVICES.     A STATEMENT FROM THE DEUTSCHER BIBLIOTHEKSVERBAND (GERMAN LIBRARYASSOCIATION.) THE CHARGES UNDER DISCUSSION ARE FOR THE LOAN OF BOOKS,PERIODICALS AND OTHER MEDIA, AND DO NOT REFER TO SPECIAL SERVICES SUCH ASPHOTOCOPYING. THE ASSOCIATION IS STRONGLY OPPOSED TO CHARGES BEING MADE FORBASIC SERVICES WHICH IT REGARDS AS A RETROGRADE STEP THAT COULD ONLY HARM THEPUBLIC LIBRARY SERVICE AND DETRACT FROM ITS EDUCATIONAL AND SOCIAL VALUE INTHE COMMUNITY. THE DETRIMENTAL EFFECTS FAR OUTWEIGH ANY POSSIBLE FINANCIALGAIN.
3179|THE LIBRARY SITUATION IN ENGLAND' INCREASING DEMAND FOR SELF-FINANCING OFSERVICE IMPROVEMENTS.     EXAMINES THE STATE OF LIBRARIES IN THE UK. DURING THE LAST 5| YEARS PUBLICLIBRARIES ESPECIALLY HAVE BEEN SUBJECT TO CUTS RESULTING IN FEWERACQUISITIONS, CLOSURE OF BRANCHES, REDUCED OPENING HOURS AND FREEZING OF STAFFPOSTS. AT THE SAME TIME ATTEMPTS ARE MADE TO INCREASE INCOME THROUGH INCREASEDFINES AND SALE OF DISCARDED MATERIAL AND PAMPHLETS, ALTHOUGH LENDING FEES HAVENOT YET BEEN IMPOSED. INTRODUCTION OF AUTOMATION IN LIBRARIES IS SEEN BY MANYAS A MEANS OF REDUCING STAFF EXPENDITURE AND IMPROVING SERVICES TO THE PUBLIC,ESPECIALLY COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY. THE LIBRARY PROVISION FOR CHILDREN, NEVERVERY GOOD COMPARED TO DANISH PUBLIC LIBRARIES, HAS BEEN STRUCK PARTICULARLYHARD BY THE CUTS. THE REACTION AGAINST THE CUTS HAS BEEN LED BY NALGO IN THEFORM OF WORK STOPPAGES AND BY THE LIBRARY ASSOCIATION AS PROTESTS TO THEAUTHORITIES.
3180|WE MUST PRESENT THE FULL BREADTH OF THE SWEDISH BOOK MARKET.     INTERVIEWS JAN GUMPERT, DIRECTOR OF THE SWEDISH LIBRARY SERVICE, WHO DISCUSSESTHE IMPACT OF CUTS ON THE LIBRARIES. LOCAL AUTHORITIES ARE FINDING THEIRCULTURAL BUDGETS, WITH LIBRARIES AS THE LARGEST ITEM, EASY TARGETS. ATTEMPTSARE MADE TO SAVE THE BOOK BUDGET AS FAR AS POSSIBLE AND CUTS ARE MADE INSTEADIN OPENING HOURS AND ACTIVITIES. VACANCIES ARE LIKELY TO BE FROZEN. FOR THELIBRARY SERVICE THE CUTS MEAN THAT THE STOCK OF OLDER TITLES WILL HAVE TO BEREDUCED, BUT THERE ARE NO PLANS TO CUT THE NUMBER OF TITLES OFFERED. EXPORT OFLIBRARY FURNITURE TO THE ARAB WORLD ALLEVIATES SOMEWHAT THE LACK OF MARKETS INSWEDEN. THE SERVICE'S COMPUTER SYSTEM, BUMS, IS NOW INSTALLED IN 34| LOCALAUTHORITIES. THERE IS CLOSE COOPERATION WITH THE RESEARCH LIBRARIES'AUTOMATION SYSTEM LIBRIS. DISCUSSES THE IMPACT OF THE LITERATURE COMMISSIONAND THE POSSIBLE EFFECTS OF THE PUBLIC LIBRARIES COMMISSION.
3181|A CHOICE BETWEEN QUALITY OR QUANTITY' THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE RECRUITMENT BANIN ENSCHEDE PUBLIC LIBRARY.     SINCE THE WORLD WAR II THE PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVICE IN THE NETHERLANDS HASUNDERGONE A PERIOD OF RAPID GROWTH. IN MANY TOWNS, NEW CENTRAL LIBRARIES ANDBRANCH LIBRARIES HAVE BEEN OPENED AND SPECIAL SERVICES HAVE BEEN INITIATED,SUCH AS MOBILE LIBRARY SERVICES, RECORD LIBRARIES AND SERVICES TO FOREIGNWORKERS AND OPEN SCHOOL STUDENTS. IN ADDITION, THE DUTCH GOVERNMENT PLANS TOINCREASE THE NUMBER OF REGIONAL SUPPORT LIBRARIES FROM 13| TO 19|. HOWEVER,ENSCHEDE PUBLIC LIBRARY, WHICH HAS BEEN DESIGNATED A REGIONAL SUPPORT LIBRARY,IS COMPELLED BY FINANCIAL CUTBACKS TO REDUCE ITS PRESENT STAFFING LEVELS BY25|%. AS A RESULT THE LIBRARY WILL BE UNABLE TO MAINTAIN THE CURRENT VOLUME OFLOANS AND CONSIDERATION HAS BEEN GIVEN TO LIMITING THE NUMBER OF BOOKS WHICH ABORROWER MAY TAKE THROUGHOUT THE YEAR AND TO REFUSING TO ENROL NEW MEMBERS.
3182|WORD PROCESSING' AN INTRODUCTION AND APPRAISAL.     IDENTIFIES AND DESCRIBES THE FACILITIES AVAILABLE FOR MECHANISING ANDAUTOMATING LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SERVICES USING WORD PROCESSING SYSTEMS-TEXTSTORAGE AND SEARCHING, ORDER PROCESSING AND BUDGET CONTROL, PREPARATION OFCATALOGUES, CIRCULATION CONTROL, PERIODICALS CONTROL AND CIRCULATION,INFORMATION STORAGE AND RETRIEVAL SYSTEM USE, AND POSSIBLE FUTURE USES.

3184|INDISPENSIBLE CONSIDERATIONS IN AUTOMATING LIBRARY TECHNIQUES.     LIBRARIES, DESPITE THEIR TRADITION-MINDED REPUTATION, ALWAYS WERE SENSIBLEABOUT THE TECHNICAL ASPECTS OF THEIR DUTIES AND OPEN TO INNOVATIONS.CONSEQUENTLY THE APPLICATION OF COMPUTER TECHNIQUES HERE IS DISCUSSED. THESESYSTEMS USUALLY ARE NOT DEVELOPED ON UNIQUE PRINCIPLES FOR LIBRARY PURPOSES,BUT HAVE BEEN ADAPTED FROM PRINCIPLES ALREADY EXISTING IN OTHER APPLICATIONS.SOME OF THESE PRINCIPLES ARE MORE APT FOR APPLICATION IN LIBRARIES THAN OTHERSREGARDING THE SPECIAL DUTIES OF LIBRARIES TOWARDS THEIR USERS. THIS FACT TODAYSEEMS TO BE SLIGHTLY UNDERRATED WHEN LIBRARIES DECIDE ABOUT THE ACQUISITION OFAN AUTOMATED SYSTEM.
3185|RECENT BREAKTHROUGHS IN LIBRARY AUTOMATION IN TAIWAN.     HIGHLIGHTS THE PROCEEDINGS OF THE INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP ON CHINESE LIBRARYAUTOMATION HELD IN TAIPEI, 14|-19| FEB 81| AND SUMMARISES THE KEY PAPERS WHICHREPORT SUCH IMPORTANT RECENT BREAKTHROUGHS AS THE DEVELOPMENT OF COMPUTERINPUT AND OUTPUT DEVICES FOR CHINESE SCRIPTS, THE DESIGN OF A CROSS-REFERENCEINPUT OF CHINESE CHARACTERS, THE COMPILATION OF 2|CHINESE CHARACTER CODE FORINFORMATION INTERCHANGE1|, THE COMPLETE REVISION OF 2|CHINESE CATALOGUINGRULES1|, THE ADOPTION OF CHINESE MARC FORMAT, AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF APROTOTYPE ON-LINE CATALOGUING SYSTEM.

WITH AUTHOR AND TITLE DATAALREADY IN THE DATA BASE, THE INTRODUCTION OF AN ON-LINE PUBLIC ACCESSCATALOGUE WITH A TOUCH SENSITIVE TERMINAL, OPENED IN OCT 80|, WAS FACILITATED.THE CARD CATALOGUE IS, HOWEVER, BEING MAINTAINED, AS THE INPUT OF SUBJECT DATAIS NOT YET COMPLETE AND AS A SAFEGUARD AGAINST COMPUTER BREAK-DOWNS. THE EXTRACOSTS INVOLVED HAD NOT BEEN FORESEEN, AND SAVINGS ON STAFF ARE NOT YETPOSSIBLE. IT IS, THEREFORE, DIFFICULT TO CALCULATE THE LONG-TERM SAVINGS FROMAUTOMATION.

THE FIRST PHASE OF THE NORTHWESTERN ON-LINETOTALLY INTEGRATED SYSTEM, (NOTIS), WAS BEGUN WITH THE LIBRARY'S MOVE TO A NEWBUILDING IN 1970|. THIS WAS AN ISSUE CONTROL SYSTEM AND WAS FOLLOWED BYAUTOMATION OF MOST TECHNICAL ROUTINES. UNDER DEVELOPMENT IS THE LIBRARY USERINFORMATION SERVICE, (LUIS), A SYSTEM WHICH ALLOWS ON-LINE SEARCHING IN THELIBRARY'S CATALOGUE OF ACQUISITIONS SINCE 1970|. THE CARD CATALOGUE IS,HOWEVER, BEING MAINTAINED MEANTIME AS LUIS DOES NOT ALLOW SUBJECT SEARCHES,NOR HAS FULL BIBLIOGRAPHIC DETAILS. ALTHOUGH COST EFFECTIVENESS OF AUTOMATIONPRIOR TO ITS INTRODUCTION HAD NOT BEEN CONSIDERED THE SYSTEM HAS BEEN SMOOTHLYINSTALLED AND HAD LED TO INCREASED PRODUCTIVITY IN THE TECHNICAL DEPARTMENT.THERE WAS GENERAL SATISFACTION WITH THE FACT THAT THE LIBRARY HAD BEEN AB LETO CREATE A WELL FUNCTIONING, INDEPENDENT SYSTEM.

3356|STATUS REPORT ON THE MAP CATALOGING PROJECT AT THE ILLINOIS STATE LIBRARY.     ILLINOIS STATE LIBRARY BEGAN ITS MAP CATALOGUING PROJECT ON 1| AUG 80|. ALLFORMERLY UNCATALOGUED SHEET MAPS ARE BEING CATALOGUED IN MARC MAP FORMAT ANDTHOSE ALREADY CATALOGUED BY VARIOUS METHODS ARE BEING RECATALOGUED, USINGOCLC. BECAUSE THE STATE LIBRARY IS A REGIONAL GOVERNMENT PRINTING OFFICEDEPOSITORY, THE FEDERAL MAPS ARE BEING CLASSIFIED ACCORDING TO THE SUDOC(SUPERINTENDENT OF DOCUMENTS) SYSTEM. ALL OTHER MAPS ARE BEING CLASSIFIED BYTHE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS G SYSTEM. DESCRIBES PROGRESS ON THE PROJECT ANDDISCUSSES PROBLEMS ENCOUNTERED AND THEIR SOLUTION.
3357|ON-LINE CATALOGUES, ON-LINE CATALOGUING.     DESCRIBES THE FORMS OF CATALOGUE PRODUCED AUTOMATICALLY FROM BIBLIOGRAPHICDATA BANKS (CARDS, COM, PRINTED, ON-LINE) AND ANALYSES THE ADVANTAGES ANDDISADVANTAGES OF EACH. THE SIGNIFICANCE OF ON-LINE TECHNOLOGY IS STRESSED FORINFORMATION RETRIEVAL AND INPUT OF CATALOGUING DATA. STRESSES THE ADVANTAGESOF AN ON-LINE SYSTEM, USING OCLC AND BLAISE AS EXAMPLES.
3358|AACR2|' OCLC'S IMPLEMENTATION AND DATABASE CONVERSION.     OCLC'S ONLINE UNION CATALOG (OLUC) CONTAINS BIBLIOGRAPHIC RECORDS CREATEDUNDER VARIOUS CATALOGUING GUIDELINES. UNTIL DEC 80|, NO SYSTEM-WIDE ATTEMPT HADBEEN MADE TO RESOLVE RECORD CONFLICTS CAUSED BY USE OF THE DIFFERENTGUIDELINES. THE INTRODUCTION OF THE NEW GUIDELINES, AACR2|, EXACERBATED THESERECORD CONFLICTS. TO REDUCE LIBRARY COSTS, WHICH MIGHT INCREASE DRAMATICALLYAS USERS ATTEMPTED TO RESOLVE THOSE CONFLICTS, OCLC CONVERTED NAME HEADINGSAND UNIFORM TITLES IN ITS DATA BASE TO AACR2| FORM.
3359|OCLC'S DATABASE CONVERSION' A USER'S PERSPECTIVE.     DESCRIBES THE EXPERIENCE OF A LARGE ACADEMIC LIBRARY WITH HEADINGS IN THE OCLCDATA BASE THAT HAVE BEEN CONVERTED TO AACR2| FORM. IT ALSO CONSIDERS THE USE OFLC AUTHORITY RECORDS IN THE DATA BASE. SPECIFIC PROBLEMS ARE DISCUSSED,INCLUDING SOME RESULTING FROM LC PRACTICES. NEVERTHELESS, THE PRESENCE OF THEAUTHORITY RECORDS, AND ESPECIALLY THE CONVERSION OF ABOUT 40|% OF THE HEADINGSIN THE BIBLIOGRAPHIC FILE, HAS BEEN OF GREAT BENEFIT TO THE LIBRARY,SIGNIFICANTLY SPEEDING UP THE CATALOGUING OPERATION.
3360|OCLC-AN AMERICAN INFORMATION SYSTEM ON ITS WAY TO DENMARK.     LIBRARY AUTOMATION BEGAN IN 1965| WITH THE FIRST MARC PILOT PROJECT INITIATEDBY THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS AND SOON TAKEN UP BY THE BRITISH NATIONALBIBLIOGRAPHY. INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS HAVE BEEN DRAWN UP TO SECURE WORLDWIDEUSE OF THE SYSTEM, CULMINATING IN THE ATTEMPT TO CREATE UNIVERSALBIBLIOGRAPHIC CONTROL. HOWEVER, EXCHANGE OF INTERNATIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHIC DATAHAS BEEN BESET BY PROBLEMS, SO THAT INTERNATIONAL USE OF MACHINE READABLEINFORMATION IS NOT VERY WIDESPREAD. THE USE OF INTERNATIONAL, ENGLISH LANGUAGEBASED STANDARDS AND EXCHANGE OF ACTUAL TAPE HAVE CAUSED PROBLEMS INSCANDINAVIA. FOR THESE REASONS BIBLIOGRAPHIC SERVICE CENTRES, 'UTILITIES',HAVE BEEN SET UP IN USA AND ENGLAND, AN IDEA WHICH IS ALSO BEHIND THE DANISHSYSTEMS SAMKAT AND BIBLIOTEKSDATA. THE LARGEST IS THE US OCLC, WHICH BEGAN IN1967|. ITS MAIN TASK IS DEVELOPMENT OF A BIBLIOGRAPHIC DATA BASE ANDDECENTRALISED CATALOGUING, WHICH SUPPLIES THE BASE WITH 60|, 000| TITLESANNUALLY FROM 4|,000| TERMINALS. IT ALSO OPERATES AN INTERLENDING SYSTEM, ANDHOPES TO ADD ACCESSIONS AND ISSUE CONTROL SYSTEMS TO THE SERVICES. THE MAINPRODUCT IS CATALOGUE CARDS. WITH THE ESTABLISHMENT OF 'OCLC EUROPE', DANISHLIBRARIES WILL HAVE TO TAKE A STAND FOR OR AGAINST COOPERATION WITH IT.

3365|CATALOGUES ON FILM.     DESCRIBES CHICAGO PUBLIC LIBRARY'S AUTOMATION SYSTEM. IN 1974| THE LIBRARYJOINED THE OCLC NETWORK AND TODAY ALL TECHNICAL DEPARTMENTS ARE AUTOMATED. THEUSERS MEET AUTOMATION THROUGH THE COM CATALOGUE (COMPUTER OUTPUT MICROFILM), ASYSTEM REGARDED AS MUCH CHEAPER THAN AN ON-LINE CATALOGUE. THERE WERE MANYTEETHING TROUBLES INVOLVED IN THE INITIAL USE OF THE CATALOGUE, PARTICULARLYIN THE BRANCH LIBRARIES, AND THE AUTOMATED ACQUISITION SYSTEM LED TO A VERYTIGHT BUDGET CONTROL OVER THE BRANCHES. ALTHOUGH NEW EDITIONS OF THE COMCATALOGUE TAKE LONGER TO ARRIVE THAN PROMISED IT HAS LED TO IMPROVEDINTERLENDING SERVICE. THE PUBLIC, HOWEVER, CONTINUE TO USE THE OLDDISCONTINUED CARD CATALOGUE AS, IT WAS CLAIMED, THEY ARE NOT INTERESTED IN THELIBRARY SERVICE'S TOTAL HOLDINGS, BUT ONLY IN THE STOCK OF THE LIBRARY BRANCHUSED. THE STAFF, TOO, DESPITE LACK OF ORGANISED OPPOSITION, EXPRESSEDCRITICISM OF THE AUTOMATION PROGRAMME.
3366|IMPLEMENTATION OF AACR2| AND ITS EFFECTS ON RESEARCH LIBRARY CATALOGS (INHEBREW).     PAPER PRESENTED AT A WORKSHOP ON AACR2|. DISCUSSES THE PROS AND CONS OFADOPTING THE NEW RULES AND EXAMINES ALTERNATIVE METHODS OF IMPLEMENTATION.THESE METHODS INCLUDE' CLOSING CARD CATALOGUES AND STARTING AUTOMATED BOOK,MICROFILM OR ON-LINE CATALOGUES; LINKING OLD AND NEW FORMS OF HEADING IN THECARD CATALOGUE; AND SELECTIVE REVISION OF OLDER HEADINGS. THE SPECIAL PROBLEMSOF CATALOGUES SEPARATED BY ALPHABET ARE TREATED, AND SOME OF THE NEW LIBRARYOF CONGRESS PRACTICES BASED ON OPTIONS IN AACR2| WHICH AFFECT JUDAICA/HEBRAICACATALOGUING ARE NOTED. THE USE OF AUTHORITY FILES TO CONTROL VARIANT FORMS OFHEADING IS STRESSED, AND FUTURE TRENDS IN AUTOMATED CATALOGUING ARECONSIDERED.
3367|THE BRITISH LIBRARY'S APPROACH TO AACR2|.     THE FORMAL COMMITMENT OF THE BRITISH LIBRARY TO AACR2| AND DEWEY 19| ENTAILEDSUBSTANTIAL CHANGES TO THE UK MARC FORMAT, THE BLAISE FILING RULES, AND AVARIETY OF PRODUCTS PRODUCED FOR THE BRITISH LIBRARY ITSELF AND FOR OTHERLIBRARIES, INCLUDING THE BRITISH NATIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHY. THE BRITISH LIBRARYFILE CONVERSION INVOLVED NOT ONLY HEADINGS BUT ALSO ALGORITHMIC CONVERSION OFTHE DESCRIPTIVE CATALOGUING.
3368|URGENT MEASURES FOR IMPROVING LOCATION REFERENCES OF PERIODICAL ARTICLES BYWAY OF THE PERIODICAL DATA BANK.     THE NATIONAL REFERENCE SYSTEM FOR PERIODICALS AND SERIALS IS THE PERIODICALDATA BANK AT THE GERMAN LIBRARY INSTITUTE AND THE STATE LIBRARY OF PRUSSIANCULTURAL HERITAGE IN BERLIN. THE DATA BANK CONTAINS TITLE DATA ON 180|,000|GERMAN AND FOREIGN PERIODICAL ARTICLES WITH 500|,000| LOCATION REFERENCES. TOIMPROVE THE SUPPLY OF PERIODICAL ARTICLES OVER THE SHORT TERM THE FOLLOWINGMEASURES ARE NECESSARY' THE ACCELERATION OF CATALOGUING OF ALL PERIODICALCOLLECTIONS IN ALL TYPES OF LIBRARIES INVOLVED IN THE NATIONAL LITERATURESUPPLY SYSTEM; THE DATA COLLECTIONS OF OTHER PERIODICAL REFERENCE SYSTEMSSHOULD BE INCLUDED IN THE DATA BANK; TITLE DATA IN THE PERIODICAL DATA BANKSHOULD BE COMPARED WITH THAT SUPPLIED BY SUBJECT INFORMATION SERVICES WITH AVIEW TO ACQUIRING MISSING TITLES; THE DATA BANK SHOULD BE CONCENTRATED IN ANON-LINE INFORMATION BANK. AN EFFICIENT ON-LINE SYSTEM WOULD EVENT UALLY LEADTO USERS BEING ABLE TO ORDER PERIODICALS DIRECTLY AND BEING REFERRED TO THENEAREST RELEVANT LIBRARY.

LECTURE GIVEN AT THE ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE VEREIN DER BIBLIOTHEKARE ANOFFENTLICHEN BIBLIOTHEKEN (ASSOCIATION OF LIBRARIANS IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES) WESTGERMANY, MAY 81|. LIBRARIANS HAVE BEEN DISCUSSING THE IDEA OF UNIFIED KEYWORDCATALOGUING RULES FOR OVER 50| YEARS AND THE SUBJECT CATALOGUING COMMITTEE OFTHE DEUTSCHES BIBLIOTHEKSINSTITUT (GERMAN LIBRARY INSTITUTE) HAS RECENTLYPRODUCED A REPORT ON THIS SUBJECT. SINCE SUBJECT CATALOGUING PROBLEMS HAVEBEEN NEGLECTED FOR DECADES AND SUBJECT CATALOGUING CARRIED OUT BY MANYINDIVIDUAL LIBRARIES HAS RESULTED IN THE WASTING OF WORK TIME, SUPER-REGIONALCOOPERATION IN THIS SPHERE OFFERS ATTRACTIVE PROSPECTS. IF REGIONAL UNIONCATALOGUE SYSTEMS AND CENTRALISED SERVICES TOOK OVER ALL SUBJECT CATALOGUING,RATIONAL RULES AND PROCEDURES WOULD RESULT. KEYWORD CATALOGUES ARE BECOMINGMORE AND MORE POPULAR AND THE CREATION OF UNIFIED RULES WILL DEMAND MOREINTENSIVE WORK BY LIBRARIANS.

FORMER ATTEMPTS TO CLASSIFY FICTION CONCENTRATED ON LITERARY GENRES AND ONESUCH ATTEMPT IN THE ROSKILD, (DENMARK) LIBRARY IS BRIEFLY REVIEWED. THE HOLONLIBRARIANS DECIDED TO BUILD A SUBJECT CATALOGUE FOR FICTION WHICH CAN BEREADILY USED BY READERS AS WELL AS LIBRARIANS. A BASIC LIST OF SUBJECTS WASDRAWN UP AND ADDITIONAL ONES ADDED AS WORKS OF FICTION WERE PROCESSED. IT WASFOUND THAT SOME FICTION CANNOT BE CLASSIFIED BY SUBJECT, WHILE OTHER WORKSRECEIVE 2| OR MORE SUBJECT CARDS. THE CLASSIFICATION WAS CARRIED OUT IN 2|STAGES; AT FIRST ONLY BOOKS CURRENTLY RECEIVED WERE CLASSIFIED, AND LATER THEEXISTING FICTION COLLECTION WAS PROCESSED IN THE SAME FASHION. THE LISTS OFSUBJECT HEADINGS IN HEBREW AND ENGLISH ARE APPENDED.

DESCRIBES PROGRESS TO DATE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF BACKEND MACHINE ARCHITECTUREFOR LARGE TEXTUAL DATA BASES OR INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS. OUTLINES THEUSE OF HIGH-SPEED PATTERN MATCHING, STRING PROCESSING, AND OTHER NON-NUMERICOPERATIONS FOR THE BASIC SEARCH MODULE. THE INVESTIGATORS HAVE ALSO USED ASTRUCTURED APPROACH AND FUNCTIONAL SEPARATION OF THE PARTS OF THE BACKENDMACHINE DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE HIGH-LEVEL QUERY LANGUAGE, WHICH COMBINES ALIMITED AMOUNT OF INVERSION WITH SERIAL HIGH-SPEED TEXT PROCESSING IN APARALLEL AND DISTRIBUTED FASHION.
3393|THE FACT DATABASE: A SYSTEM BASED ON INFERENTIAL METHODS.     THE FACT DATA BASE (A MODEL FOR A NEW TYPE OF INFORMATION-HANDLING SYSTEM) ISDESCRIBED IN TERMS OF ITS MAIN DATA STRUCTURE (BUILT FROM UNITS OF INFORMATIONCALLED 'FACTS') AND ITS CONCEPTUAL SECTION WHICH MANIPULATES THE STRUCTURE(THE FACT MACHINE). ITS NOVELTY ARISES FROM ITS INTERNAL KNOWLEDGE STRUCTURE-AMODEL OF THE REAL WORLD DESCRIBED BY THE DATA BASE AND REPRESENTATION OFINFORMATION FED TO THE MACHINE. THIS, AUGMENTED BY INFORMATION ABOUT SETMEMBERSHIP, ENABLES THE SYSTEM TO USE INFERENTIAL METHODS IN MANY ASPECTS OFITS OPERATION. SHOWS HOW THESE FEATURES LEAD TO A SIMPLE, FLEXIBLE INTERFACE,BOTH TO OTHER COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND TO 'USER FRIENDLY' QUERY LANGUAGES.
3394|A TERM WEIGHTING MODEL BASED ON UTILITY THEORY.     3| INFORMATION RETRIEVAL TERM-WEIGHTING MODELS (INVERSE DOCUMENT FREQUENCY,TERM DISCRIMINATION VALUE, AND TERM PRECISION) ARE DESCRIBED AND RELATED TOONE ANOTHER USING UTILITY THEORY AS AN EVALUATION MODEL. DEMONSTRATES THAT ALL3| LEAD TO THE SAME CONCLUSION' WHEN TERM INDEPENDENCE AND BINARY INDEXING(NON-WEIGHTED) ARE INITIALLY ASSUMED, THE MOST IMPORTANT TERMS EXHIBIT MEDIUMFREQUENCY AND THE WORST ONES ARE THE HIGH FREQUENCY TERMS.
3395|MULTILEVEL INFORMATION SYSTEM-TOWARDS MORE FLEXIBLE INFORMATION RETRIEVALSYSTEMS.     THE MULTILEVEL INFORMATION SYSTEM (MLIS), AN EXTENSION OF A TYPICALINFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEM TOWARDS MORE COMPLETE DATA PROCESSING, ISDISCUSSED. MLIS INTEGRATES FUNCTIONS TYPICAL FOR DATA BASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEMSAND RETRIEVAL-ORIENTED SYSTEMS. SEVERAL LEVELS OF DATA ACCESSING ARE PROVIDED,EACH LEVEL DEVELOPED FOR A DIFFERENT CLASS OF USERS.
3396|AN ASSOCIATIVE FILE STORE USING FRAGMENTS FOR RUN-TIME INDEXING ANDCOMPRESSION.     AN ASSOCIATIVE FILE STORE (AFS) IS OFFERED AS A SIMPLE SOLUTION TO CURRENTPROBLEMS WITH ON-LINE INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS. IT WOULD BE ASINGLE-INSTRUCTION MULTIPLE-DATA STREAM MACHINE, DEDICATED TO ASSOCIATIVE FILESEARCHING WHILE OVERALL CONTROL OF THE SYSTEM WOULD BE ENTRUSTED TO ACONVENTIONAL SINGLE-INSTRUCTION SINGLE-DATA STREAM MACHINE. THE ASSOCIATIVEPARALLEL PROCESSOR (A MAJOR COMPONENT OF AFS) WOULD SUPPORT 'ON-THE-FLY' FILESEARCHING AND SIMPLIFY THE INDEXING PROBLEMS OF DIRECTLY ACCESSING SINGLERECORDS TO THAT OF INDICATING THE MOST PROBABLE SCAN BLOCK FOR A HIGH RECALLOF MATCHING RECORDS. INITIAL CONSIDERATIONS SUGGEST THAT AFS WOULD OUT-PERFORMCONVENTIONAL FILE STORES BY OVER 2| ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE, BE SIMPLE TO MAINTAIN,AND OFFER FULL FREE-TEXT RETRIEVAL FLEXIBILITY.
3397|PROBLEMS IN THE SIMULATION OF BIBLIOGRAPHIC RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS.     PRESENTS A FORMAL PROBABILISTIC LOGICAL MODEL OF A BIBLIOGRAPHIC RETRIEVALSYSTEM WHICH CAN BE USED AS A BASIS FOR THE COMPUTER SIMULATION OF INFORMATIONRETRIEVAL FROM A BIBLIOGRAPHIC DATA BASE. DESCRIBES A SPECIFIC IMPLEMENTATIONOF THE MODEL AND ASSESS HOW WELL THE IMPLEMENTATION WAS ABLE TO SIMULATE THECRANFIELD II AND MEDLARS RETRIEVAL TEST COLLECTIONS AT CORNELL UNIVERSITY'SCOMPUTER SCIENCE DEPARTMENT.

THE QUESTION OF 'MIGRATION'(FROM PRINTED TO ON-LINE DATA BASE PRODUCTS) AND THE FACT THAT EXPENSES HAVEINCREASED MORE THAN INCOME ARE DISCUSSED AS THEY RELATE TO THE SURVIVAL ORGROWTH OF DATA BASE ORGANISATIONS. SINCE THE DATA BASE HAS GONE ON-LINE, THEREHAVE BEEN SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN THE DATA BASE REVENUE, CONNECT HOURS, ANDNUMBERS OF ON-LINE USERS. AT THE SAME TIME, THERE HAVE BEEN DECREASES IN THENUMBER OF DATA BASE LEASES AND LICENCES, THE NUMBER OF PRINT PRODUCTSUBSCRIPTIONS, AND THE EXCESS OF INCOME OVER EXPENSES. IN CONSTA NT DOLLARS,THE COST OF PRODUCING AN ABSTRACT HAS DECREASED, THE SUBSCRIPTION CHARGE FORPRINTED PRODUCTS HAS INCREASED ONLY SLIGHTLY, THE LEASE AND LICENSE FEES HAVEDECREASED, ROYALTY CHARGES HAVE INCREASED, AND HOURLY CONNECT FEES HAVEREMAINED STEADY (EVEN THOUGH THE SIZE OF THE ON-LINE FILE HAS INCREASEDGREATLY). THE PROBLEM IS THAT OF MAINTAINING A BALANCED FINANCIAL STATUS INLIGHT OF INCREASED INCOME FROM ONE CLASS OF PRODUCTS, DECREASED INCOME FROMANOTHER CLASS OF PRODUCTS, AND INCREASED COST OF OPERATION. POSSIBLEAPPROACHES TO ENSURE ECONOMIC VIABILITY ARE CONSIDERED IN TERMS OF EXPENSES,EFFICIENCY OF OPERATION, MARKETING, PRODUCTS, SERVICES, AND PRICING. THE MOSTPROMISING APPROACHES LIE IN THE AREAS OF PRICING AND DEVELOPMENT OF NEWPRODUCTS AND SERVI CES.

CONCLUDES THAT IN THE NEXT DECADE SOCIETY'S ATTITUDES WILLINFLUENCE ORGANISATIONAL PRACTICE AND THE GOVERNMENT, WHO WILL CARRY THE MAJORRESPONSIBILITY TO ENSURE THAT ANY NEGATIVE SIDE EFFECTS ARE PROPERLY DEALTWITH.
3462|OFFICE SYSTEMS AND PEOPLE.     OFFICES ARE ORGANISATIONAL UNITS IN WHICH INFORMATION IS PROCESSED BY PEOPLE.IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT WE UNDERSTAND THE ATTITUDES AND REQUIREMENTS OF THESEPEOPLE BEFORE WE ATTEMPT TO DESIGN SYSTEMS FOR THEM. WE NEED MODELS OF OFFICESAND OF OFFICE WORK, FOR USE AS A BASIS FOR SYSTEM DESIGN AND SYSTEMEVALUATION. MODELS CAN BE DEVELOPED THROUGH STUDIES OF OFFICES AND INPARTICULAR THROUGH OBSERVATIONS OF HOW ELECTRONIC OFFICE SYSTEMS IMPACT OFFICEWORK. SUMMARISES RECENT RESEARCH WORK IN THESE AREAS, AND SHOWS HOW IT CANASSIST US IN DESIGNING SYSTEMS THAT MEET THE NEEDS OF OFFICE WORKERS.

DESCRIBES THE REASONS FOR A STRATEGY TO BE ESTABLISHED, AND AIMSAND BENEFITS OF ADOPTING SUCH A STRATEGY WHICH WILL EVENTUALLY PROVIDE FORCONVERGENCE OF TEXT AND DATA SYSTEMS AND FOR HIGH SPEED COMMUNICATIONS ANDELECTRONIC MAILING BETWEEN ALL MAJOR BR LOCATIONS.
3469|THE MICROWRITER.     CURRENTLY THE MICROWRITER IS THE FOUNDATION FOR A NEW WAY OF WRITING IN ALMOSTANY ENVIRONMENT, WITH ONLY 1| HAND, AND WITH THE CAPACITY AND CAPABILITY OFBEING ABLE TO STORE, RETRIEVE, EDIT, FORMAT AND TRANSMIT WRITTEN INFORMATIONEITHER AS THE PRINTED WORD, OR IN CONVERTIBLE MACHINE LANGUAGE. SEPARATED FROMTHE MICROWRITER, THE 5| FINGER KEYBOARD COULD BE FITTED TO CONVENTIONALEQUIPMENT, SUCH AS TYPEWRITERS, WORD PROCESSING UNITS, TELEX AND COMPUTERS,GIVING ACCESS TO NUMEROUS PEOPLE WHO HAVE THE AUTHORITY AND NEED TOCOMMUNICATE DIRECTLY WITH THE EQUIPMENT, BUT ARE UNABLE TO MASTER THEOPERATION OF THE QWERTY KEYBOARD EFFICIENTLY! IN THESE CASES THE MICROWRITERKEYBOARD WILL BE A PERIPHERAL IN ADDITION TO THE NORMAL KEYBOARD, AND THECHARACTERISTICS OF THE EQUIPMENT WILL OPERATE IN THE NORMAL WAY.
3470|A STUDY OF THE ARMY'S WORD PROCESSING PROGRAM WITH CASES.     DEMONSTRATES POTENTIAL ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES THAT COULD RESULT FROM THEIMPLEMENTATION OF A WORD PROCESSING/ADMINISTRATIVE SUPPORT SYSTEM. A MODEL ISPRESENTED ON PLANNING, IMPLEMENTING, AND MAINTAINING A WORDPROCESSING/ADMINISTRATIVE SUPPORT SYSTEM. A COMPARISON IS MADE OF THE GUIDANCECONTAINED IN AR 340|-8| AND THE GUIDANCE CONTAINED IN THE CURRENT WORDPROCESSING LITERATURE AS PERTAINS TO THE ACTIVITIES PRESENTED IN THE MODEL.
3471|VISUAL ASPECTS OF THE ELECTRONIC OFFICE.     SOME OF THE VISUAL TASKS INVOLVED IN USING A VDT DIFFER IN KIND FROM THOSEENCOUNTERED IN A TRADITIONAL OFFICE. THE SELF-LUMINOUS NATURE OF THE SCREENCHARACTERS AND THE 3| TASK AREAS OF SOURCE MATERIAL, KEYBOARD AND SCREENPRESENT A CHALLENGE TO THE LIGHTING DESIGNER AND ERGONOMIST. SUITABLECOMBINATIONS OF LIGHT SOURCE AND LUMINAIRE AND THE RELATIVE LOCATIONS OF ALLTHE ELEMENTS INVOLVED CAN PROVIDE ACCEPTABLE SOLUTIONS BUT DUE RECOGNITIONSHOULD BE PAID TO THE OPHTHALMIC REQUIREMENTS OF OPERATORS.
3472|DISPLAY TECHNOLOGIES FOR OFFICE SYSTEMS.     CONSIDERS THE REQUIREMENTS FOR AN IDEAL OFFICE DISPLAY AND COMPARES CRT(CATHODE RAY TUBES) WITH MATRIX DISPLAYS TO SEE HOW CLOSELY THEY CAN MEETREQUIREMENTS. THE CRT CAN MEET THE DISPLAY FUNCTION REQUIREMENTS BUT IS NOTIDEAL IN SPACE TAKEN, POWER AND WEIGHT.

THE OTHER PROJECT, STILLIN PROGRESS, AIMS TO DEVELOP A RADICALLY NEW DISPLAY PROCESSOR TECHNOLOGY, THEHOPE BEING THAT IT WILL INCREASE SIGNIFICANTLY THE SPEED OF IMAGE GENERATIONIN BITMAP DISPLAY SYSTEMS.
3474|TELECOMMUNICATIONS IN THE ELECTRONIC OFFICE.     THE WORK STATION OF THE EXECUTIVE OF THE FUTURE WILL EVOLVE FROM THECOMMUNICATING WORD PROCESSOR (CWP) AND WILL INCORPORATE THE BASIC FACILITIESPROVIDED BY THE CWP FOR INPUT, TEXT DISPLAY, TEXT MANIPULATION, HARD COPYOUTPUT AND COMMUNICATION. THE ENHANCEMENT OF THESE FACILITIES WILL RESULT FROMTHE ADDITION OF FEATURES CURRENTLY FOUND IN STAND ALONE DEVICES. DESCRIBESSOME OF THE MORE LIKELY DEVELOPMENTS THAT WILL EMERGE FOR INPUT, STORAGE ANDOUTPUT. ALSO DISCUSSES COMMUNICATION AND NETWORK SERVICES AND STANDARDISATION.
3475|THE EXTENSION OF COMPUTER INTELLIGENCE.     THE RATE OF TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE WILL BE ACCELERATED BY THE DEVELOPMENT OFMICROPROCESSORS.

PRESENTS A GENERALDESCRIPTION OF A TYPICAL MICROPROCESSOR BASED OFFICE AUTOMATION SYSTEM, THENDISCUSSES THE PROBLEMS ARISING IN THE DESIGN, IMPLEMENTATION, AND USE OF SUCHSYSTEMS. PROPOSES A SCHEME FOR PARTITIONING AND MODULARISING THE HARDWARE ANDSOFTWARE OF THE SYSTEM, TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THE SOLUTION OF SOMEPROBLEMS OF COMPATIBILITY, PORTABILITY AND SYSTEM EXTENSIBILITY. THE PROPOSEDSYSTEM CAN BE USED AS A UNIVERSAL BASIC CORE ON WHICH ONE CAN EASILY BUILDLARGER WORD PROCESSING SYSTEMS. THE USER CAN, BY HIMSELF, EXTEND HIS SYSTEM BYUSING THE SAME WORD PROCESSING LANGUAGE HE USES EVERYDAY BECAUSE OF ITSSPECIAL PROPERTIES PRESENTED HERE. THE SYSTEM IS ALSO SIMPLY RECONFIGURABLE ATTHE WILL OF THE USER TO EXACTLY FI T HIS NEEDS AT ANY TIME.
3478|SCRAPBOOK-A GENERAL PURPOSE INFORMATION HANDLING SYSTEM.     THE ELECTRONIC OFFICE OF THE FUTURE WILL REQUIRE A SOPHISTICATED INFORMATIONHANDLING FRAMEWORK ON WHICH TO BASE SUCH FACILITIES AS ELECTRONIC MAIL,FACSIMILE TRANSMISSION AND WORD PROCESSING. SCRAPBOOK REPRESENTS AN EARLYSTAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF SUCH A SYSTEM. IT PROVIDES FACILITIES FORINFORMATION RETRIEVAL, ELECTRONIC MAIL AND WORD PROCESSING, AND MAY BE READILYADAPTED TO INCORPORATE MORE SPECIALISED FACILITIES FOR PARTICULAR USERS. THEEMPHASIS IS ON FLEXIBILITY, SO THAT CHANGING USER REQUIREMENTS MAY BE MET WITHLITTLE OR NO REPROGRAMMING EFFORT.

THE AREAS FOR RESEARCH ARE'LIBRARIES AND INFORMATION SERVICES IN SOCIETY; PRODUCTION OF INFORMATION ANDITS USERS; STORAGE SYSTEMS; AND ADMINISTRATION AND PLANNING. THESE TEND TO BELIBRARY ORIENTED RATHER THAN USER/COMMUNITY ORIENTED. FUTURE PROGRAMMES SHOULDIDENTIFY PROBLEMS NOT OFFER SOLUTIONS. PERHAPS IT WOULD BE MOST FRUITFUL TOSEE LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SCIENCE AS A PART OF SOCIOLOGY. THE NEW POST OFASSISTANT PROFESSOR IN THE DEPARTMENT AT THE UNIVERSITY SHOULD ALSO HAVE THERESPONSIBILITY FOR RESEARCH DEVELOPMENT.

HE IS A PROLIFICAND IMPORTANT AUTHOR ON LIBRARIANSHIP.
3539|THE NEED FOR LIBRARIES.     THE CONSTRUCTION OF NEW LIBRARY BUILDINGS AS WELL AS THE COMPUTERISATION OFLIBRARY AND INFORMATION SERVICES HAVE BEEN STUDIED BY THE STAFF OF A SPECIALDEPARTMENT AT THE CYRIL AND METHODIUS NATIONAL LIBRARY IN SOFIA. NOW, THE TIMEHAS COME TO ESTABLISH AN INDEPENDENT TECHNICAL CENTRE FOR LIBRARIES, SIMILARTO THE ONE IN PRAGUE, CZECHOSLOVAKIA. AMONG THE CENTRE'S 1|ST AND FOREMOSTCOMMITMENTS SHOULD BE THE COLLECTION OF INFORMATION ON THE CONTEMPORARYWORLDWIDE TRENDS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF LIBRARY BUILDINGS AND THEIR UP-TO-DATEEQUIPMENT. THIS BROAD GENERAL KNOWLEDGE SHOULD BE POOLED FOR THE NEW,SPECIFIED LIBRARY BUILDINGS, AND ALSO FOR THE RECONSTRUCTION, EXTENSION ANDMODERNISATION OF EXISTING LIBRARIES. SUCH ACTIVITIES SHOULD LEAD TO THEESTABLISHMENT OF ARCHIVES OF TECHNICAL DOCUMENTATION AND INDUSTRIAL CATALOGUESFOR THE BENEFIT OF ARCHITECTS, DESIGNERS, LIBRARIANS AND OTHERS. OTHERLONG-TERM TARGETS INCLUDE THE DESIGN OF A NEW, PROGRESSIVE METHOD OF SERVICETO  READERS AND INFORMATION USERS AND TO ENHANCE THE QUALITY OF BOTH WORK ANDPRIVATE LIVES.

LECTURE GIVEN AT THE 10|TH ADVANCED TRAINING SEMINAR FOR LIBRARIANS AT THEHERZOG AUGUST LIBRARY IN WOLFENBUTTEL, FEB 81|. FOR YEARS LIBRARIANS HAVEARGUED OVER THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN PURE LIBRARIANSHIP AND ADMINISTRATION INTHEIR WORK, WHICH ARE PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT WHEN ALLOTTING TASKS TO THEHIGHEST STAFF GRADES. LIBRARIANS FEEL THEMSELVES TO BE INADEQUATELYREPRESENTED WHEN QUESTIONS ON UNIVERSITY STAFFING ARISE AND SHOULD STRIVE FORBETTER COORDINATION. ADMINISTRATION IS NOT PART OF THE ACADEMIC DISCIPLINE OFLIBRARIANSHIP AND CLOSE LINKS MUST BE ESTABLISHED BETWEEN THIS DISCIPLINE ANDTHE ACADEMIC LIBRARIAN. ADMINISTRATIVE AND PROFESSIONAL DUTIES FOR THE HIGHESTSTAFF GRADES, ESPECIALLY FOR HEADS OF SUBJECT DEPARTMENTS, MUST BE CLEARLYDEFINED.
3542|POLITICS, LIBRARIES AND UAP.     THE FIRST ISSUE OF 2|SLJ' SOCIALIST LIBRARIANS JOURNAL1| CLAIMS THAT THERE IS ANEED FOR AN INTERNATIONAL FORUM ON LIBRARIANSHIP FROM A SOCIALIST VIEWPOINT,BUT FAILS TO EXPLAIN THE BASIC TENETS OF SOCIALIST LIBRARIANSHIP. REVIEWS SOMEOF THE RECENT LITERATURE ON THIS TOPIC, AND SUGGESTS THAT LIBRARIES MUST,THROUGH FREE ACCESS AND UAP (UNIVERSAL AVAILABILITY OF PUBLICATIONS), ALLOWEVERY THINKING PERSON TO BE ABLE TO FORM HIS OR HER OWN OPINION OF THE WORLDAND THE SOCIETY ROUND THEM. WHILST 2|SLJ1| LACKS INGENUITY AND IS OFTENINCOMPREHENSIBLE, IT ALSO FAILS TO INDICATE THAT SOCIALISM MUST REQUIRE ASOLID PHILOSOPHICAL AND POLITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE.
3543|DO LIBRARIANS FEAR PROFESSIONALISM?.     PAPER PRESENTED AT THE NATIONAL LIBRARIANS ASSOCIATION-SPONSORED PROGRAMME ATTHE MICHIGAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION, 11| OCT 80|. ARGUES THAT IN THE USA LIBRARIANSHAVE BEEN UNABLE TO ACHIEVE THE DISTINCTIVE STATUS OF A PROFESSION. THEY HAVENO WAY OF MAKING THE CLAIM STICK THAT THEY HAVE CRUCIAL SKILLS AND KNOWLEDGEOF VITAL IMPORTANCE TO SOCIETY. AS A RESULT THEY ARE AN OCCUPATIONAL GROUPUNABLE TO INCREASE SIGNIFICANTLY THE ECONOMIC WELL BEING AND PRESTIGE OFLIBRARIANSHIP THROUGH TRADITIONAL PROFESSIONAL MEANS. BECAUSE OF LIBRARYASSOCIATIONS' EMPHASIS ON THE INSTITUTION, THERE IS A LACK OF CONCENTRATION ONWHAT CONSTITUTES THE PROFESSIONAL BASIS FOR LIBRARIANSHIP; THE ASSOCIATIONSHAVE CREATED A SITUATION WHERE THE LIBRARIAN HAS OCCUPATIONAL POWER WITHOUTTHE GROWING SOCIAL PROBLEMS OF PROFESSIONAL POWER.
3544|ON EMPIRICAL FOUNDATIONS OF INFORMATION SCIENCE.     IN THIS STUDY OF EMPIRICAL FOUNDATIONS OF INFORMATION SCIENCE, PERTINENTEMPIRICAL LAWS AND HYPOTHESES, WHICH HAVE BEEN REPORTED IN SCIENTIFIC ANDTECHNICAL LITERATURE, WERE CATALOGUED, DESCRIBED, AND ANALYSED FOR THEIRDEPENDENCIES AND RELATIONSHIPS. THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF RESEARCH WAS TO IDENTIFYA BODY OF KNOWLEDGE, DERIVED FROM EMPIRICAL OBSERVATIONS OF INFORMATIONPHENOMENA AND REPRESENTATIVE OF INFORMATION SCIENCE AS A DISTINCT SCIENTIFICDISCIPLINE. THIS BODY OF KNOWLEDGE DEALS WITH CONCEPTS SUCH AS INFORMATIONVALUE, RELEVANCE, AGING OF INFORMATION, GROWTH OF KNOWLEDGE, OBSOLESCENCE,INFORMATION SCATTER, PRODUCTIVITY OF INFORMATION SOURCES AND INFORMATION FLOW.

3547|QUANTITATIVE AND SEMANTIC ASPECTS OF THE CONCEPTION OF INFORMATION.     COMPARES THE MEANINGS OF THE SEMANTIC INFORMATION QUANTITY UNIT AND SHANNON'SINFORMATION QUANTITY UNIT AND THE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH THEY CAN BE USED.CONCLUDES THAT THE FORMER CAN BE A MEANS OF CALCULATING THE DEGREE OFINFORMATION ADEQUACY AND DOES NOT EXHAUST ALL METHODS OF INFORMATIONMEASUREMENT. IF ONE PASSES FROM THE TASK OF INFORMATION TRANSFER TO THAT OFINFORMATION STORAGE, THE CONCEPT OF INFORMATION QUANTITY BECOMES THE CONCEPTOF INFORMATION VOLUME.

A CONCLUSION WAS REACHED THAT BIBLIOGRAPHICTRAINING WILL BENEFIT FROM THE PLANNED CHANGES AND GREATER COORDINATION OFGENERAL AND SPECIAL BIBLIOGRAPHY COURSES WILL HAVE A POSITIVE EFFECT ON THEEDUCATION OF FUTURE BIBLIOGRAPHERS.
3556|TEACHING BIBLIOMETRICS.     CLAIMS THAT BIBLIOMETRICS, AS A SPECIFIC SUBJECT TOPIC, IS BEING NEGLECTED BYLIBRARY SCHOOLS AND IS TREATED IN A LESS THAN SATISFACTORY MANNER BY RESEARCHMETHODS TEXTBOOKS AND THE PROFESSIONAL LITERATURE. ARGUES THAT BIBLIOMETRICSSHOULD BE MOVED INTO THE MAINSTREAM OF GRADUATE LIBRARY SCHOOL CURRICULA.
3557|DOCUMENTATION AS A PART OF THE SYLLABUS AT DUTCH LIBRARY SCHOOLS.     THE TERM 'DOCUMENTATION' WAS 1|ST USED BY PAUL OTLET OF THE INSTITUTINTERNATIONAL DE BIBLIOGRAPHIE IN 1905|.

MASSMEDIA AND EDUCATIONAL ESTABLISHMENTS PLAY A MUCH GREATER PART IN THIS RESPECT.THE DESIRABLE TURNOVER OF POLITICAL LITERATURE, THE OPTIMUM NUMBER OF COPIES,AND THE DISCARDING OF OBSOLETE BOOKS ARE ALSO COVERED. ON THE WHOLE, THELIBRARY SERVICE IS PERFORMING A VALUABLE ROLE IN POLITICAL EDUCATION, BUT EVENSO, THERE IS LITTLE ROOM FOR COMPLACENCY.
3660|ARCHIVAL RESOURCES ON LABOUR RELATIONS IN THE UNIVERSITE LAVAL ARCHIVEDIVISION.     DESCRIBES 11| ARCHIVE COLLECTIONS ON LABOUR RELATIONS AT LAVAL UNIVERSITY, INTHE CONTEXT OF GENERAL DISCUSSION OF THE ARCHIVE DIVISION'S POLICY OFESTABLISHING HOLDINGS OF SIGNIFICANT DOCUMENTS RELATING TO QUEBEC IN THISFIELD, AND PROCEDURES FOR ACQUISITION. FOR EACH COLLECTION, TECHNICAL DETAILSARE GIVEN, A BRIEF SKETCH OF THE PERSONS OR GROUPS INVOLVED, AND A SUMMARY OFTHE CONTENTS. HOLDINGS INCLUDE ORIGINAL DOCUMENTS FROM TRADE UNIONS, PROMINENTTRADE UNIONISTS, AND PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATIONS.
3661|AN UNUSUAL SUBJECT LIBRARY.     DESCRIBES A BIOLOGY LIBRARY FOR SENIOR PUPILS IN A GRAMMAR SCHOOL. THE LIBRARYIS OPEN ALL MORNING; PUPILS MAY COME IN FREELY TO STUDY, BORROW BOOKS ANDPHOTOCOPIES AND EXAMINE SPECIMENS. THEY CAN MAKE COFFEE THERE AND CHAT TOTHEIR FRIENDS. ALTHOUGH THE PUPILS THEMSELVES ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ISSUES, VERYFEW BOOKS HAVE BEEN LOST. THERE ARE ABOUT 500| BOOKS, INCLUDING REFERENCE BOOKSAND TEXTBOOKS, FREQUENTLY WITH MULTIPLE COPIES. IN 1979|-80|, 150| SENIOR PUPILSBORROWED, ON AVERAGE, 4| BOOKS EACH. GENERAL SCHOOL LIBRARIES SHOULD BE DIVIDEDINTO SUBJECT LIBRARIES RUN BY DEPARTMENTAL HEADS. THESE LIBRARIES SHOULD BESMALL, CLEARLY ARRANGED AND FREELY ACCESSIBLE.
3662|ENERGY INFORMATION ADMINISTRATION MICROFICHE.     THE DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY'S ENERGY INFORMATION ADMINISTRATION HAS BEEN MAKINGAVAILABLE IN MICROFICHE ITS RETROSPECTIVE COLLECTION OF ENERGY-RELATEDPUBLICATIONS. AS AN AID TO ACCESSING THESE DOCUMENTS, THE AUTHOR HAS COMPILEDA LIST CORRELATING EIA REPORT NUMBERS TO THEIR SUDOCS CLASSIFICATION AND2|AMERICAN STATISTICS INDEX 1|ACCESSION NUMBERS.
3663|ART TO THE PEOPLE.     ARGUES THAT LIBRARIES HAVE AN IMPORTANT ROLE TO PLAY IN MAKING THE PUBLICFAMILIAR WITH ART. THE 1964| DANISH LIBRARY ACT MADE IT POSSIBLE TO DEVELOP ARTDEPARTMENTS AND SEVERAL LARGER LIBRARIES TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THIS, LENDINGMOSTLY PRINTS, POSTERS AND SLIDES. THIS DEVELOPMENT HAS NOW STAGNATED OWING TOVARIOUS MISCONCEPTIONS. THUS ART NEED NOT BE PLACED IN SPECIAL BUILDINGS ONLYVISITED BY HIGHLY MOTIVATED PEOPLE. A LIBRARY SHOULD BEGIN BY LENDING POSTERS,WHICH ARE EASY TO HANDLE, AND THEN PROCEED TO PRINTS. ART NEED NOT BEEXPENSIVE, A POSTER COSTING NO MORE THAN A BOOK, AND LARGE COLLECTIONS ARE NOTNECESSARY. WHEREAS ACQUISITION OF POSTERS IS SIMPLE, PRINTS AND SLIDES DEMANDMORE ATTENTION AS CENTRAL AIDS TO SELECTION OF MATERIAL ARE LACKING.EXHIBITIONS ARE IMPORTANT FOR WIDENING PEOPLE'S CONCEPTION OF ART. REGRETSTHAT THE NEW DANISH LIBRARY BILL OMITS ANY MENTION OF ART.
3664|MUSIC JOURNALS IN THE LIBRARY.     MUSIC, AS A TOPIC OF SPECIAL INTEREST IN JOURNAL LITERATURE, IS DISCUSSEDHISTORICALLY, DESCRIPTIVELY, AND BIBLIOGRAPHICALLY. THE BROAD RANGE OF TITLESREFLECTS THE CONCERNS OF AMATEURS AS WELL AS PROFESSIONALS, AND SELECTEDSOURCES FOR INFORMATION AND EVALUATION ARE PROVIDED TO ASSIST LIBRARIANS INSELECTING APPROPRIATE JOURNALS FOR THEIR PARTICULAR COMMUNITIES OF USERS.
3665|HISTORICAL RESEARCH. A GUIDE TO SELECTED LIBRARY INFORMATION AT THE UNIVERSITYOF TENNESSEE, KNOXVILLE.     ORIENTED TOWARD THE HISTORICAL RESEARCHER, THIS GUIDE SELECTIVELY INTRODUCESMAJOR AVAILABLE USA, UK AND WEST EUROPEAN RESOURCES. ANNOTATED FOR USEFULNESSAND CONTENT, THESE MATERIALS ARE BROADLY ORGANISED IN CATEGORIES ACCORDING TOTHE TYPE OF INFORMATION THEY PROVIDE. INCLUDED ARE RESEARCH GUIDES;ENCYCLOPEDIAS, DICTIONARIES, AND TABLES; BIBLIOGRAPHIES; INDEXES ANDABSTRACTS; BIOGRAPHICAL SOURCES; STATISTICS; NATIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHIES; BOOKREVIEWS; DISSERTATIONS; ATLASES AND GAZETTEERS; PORTRAITS AND PICTORIALSOURCES; GUIDES TO LIBRARIES, ARCHIVES, AND MANUSCRIPTS; GOVERNMENTPUBLICATIONS; AND AN AUTHOR TITLE INDEX.

3666|ARABIC PALEOGRAPHY (IN ARABIC).     DISCUSSES THE USES OF PALEOGRAPHY AND THE SOURCES OF ARABIC PALEOGRAPHY WHICHINCLUDE' OLD COPIES OF THE KOR'AN; PAPYRUS LEAVES; MEMORIAL INSCRIPTIONS; OLDTOMBS; OLD COINS AND DRESSES; WOOD, CLAY, POTS AND RINGS; LETTERS AND WRITINGSON THE DEVELOPMENT OF ARABIC PALEOGRAPHY; SOME OF THE CLASSIC BOOKS ABOUT IT;AND THE SCHOOLS OF ISLAMIC PALEOGRAPHY. ITS ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES, ANDTHE DEVELOPMENT OF ARAB LETTER PRINTING ARE DISCUSSED.
3667|RECENT DOCUMENTATION FOR THE STUDY OF THE SECOND WORLD WAR.     IN RECENT YEARS MUCH CAPTURED OR PREVIOUSLY CLASSIFIED GOVERNMENT INFORMATIONABOUT THE SECOND WORLD WAR AND THE PRE- AND POST-WAR YEARS HAS BEEN PUBLISHEDIN MICROFORMAT. PRESENTS A DESCRIPTIVE, SELECTED SURVEY OF THESE MAJORDOCUMENTS AND GROUPS OF RECORDS NOW AVAILABLE.
3668|THE LIBRARY'S ADMINISTRATIVE BODY: CLEAR GUIDELINES NOW!.     THE NORWEGIAN GOVERNMENT ENVISAGES CULTURAL COMMITTEES AS ADMINISTERINGLIBRARIES. INDIVIDUAL LIBRARY COMMITTEES MAY SURVIVE, BUT AS EXCEPTIONS AND INCONFLICT WITH OFFICIAL POLICY. THE LIBRARY SUB-COMMITTEE IS UNSATISFACTORY. AMINISTRY OF CHURCH AND EDUCATION DOCUMENT (1979|) OUTLINES DIVISION OFRESPONSIBILITY BETWEEN LIBRARIAN AND CULTURAL ADMINISTRATION. LIBRARIANS MUSTINSIST ON SEVERAL PROFESSIONAL DEMANDS. IF THESE STIPULATIONS ARE UPHELD, ANDGUIDELINES DRAWN UP WITH THE SUPPORT OF LIBRARY ORGANISATIONS, LIBRARIES MAYSURVIVE.
3669|THE INTEGRATED LIBRARY SYSTEM OF THE FUTURE.     PRESENT-DAY LIBRARIES AND LIBRARIANS FACE SERIOUS PROBLEMS OF ECONOMICS,POLITICS, AND TECHNOLOGY. ADEQUATE FUNDING IS IN SHORT SUPPLY WHILE LIBRARIANSDO NOT ACT EFFECTIVELY IN THE POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT, AND TECHNOLOGY THREATENSTO LEAD LIBRARIANS RATHER THAN FOLLOW. USING THE ANALOGY OF A BUSINESS OFFICE,THE AUTHOR PROPOSES AN INTEGRATED LIBRARY SYSTEM OF THE FUTURE WITH 3|COMPONENTS; THE LIBRARY, THE JOB, AND THE HOME.
3670|THE DEVELOPMENT OF LIBRARIES AND NETWORKS' PROSPECTIVE ROLES ANDRESPONSIBILITIES FOR LIBRARIES IN NEW JERSEY. 19|TH REPORT.     THE COMMISSION CONCLUDE THAT A REVISION OF LIBRARY LAWS AND AID PROGRAMMES INNEW JERSEY IS NECESSARY TO COMBAT THE EFFECTS OF INFLATION, GROWTH OFINFORMATION AND TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE ON THE ABILITY OF PUBLICLY-SUPPORTEDLIBRARIES TO FULFIL THEIR ROLES IN SOCIETY.
3671|ELEMENTS TO BE INCORPORATED IN LIBRARY NETWORK LEGISLATION.     DRAFTED BY THE NEW JERSEY STATE LIBRARY, THIS LEGISLATIVE PROPOSAL PRESENTSDETAILED PROVISIONS FOR THE GOVERNANCE AND SUPPORT OF A STATE LIBRARY NETWORK.IT CREATES A HIERARCHICAL NETWORKING STRUCTURE TO INCLUDE LIBRARIES OF ALLTYPES, DEFINES SERVICES AND PROGRAMMES TO BE ADMINISTERED, AND ESTABLISHESADMINISTRATIVE AND FUNDING MECHANISMS. ADDITIONAL PROPOSED LEGISLATION ISOUTLINED WHICH REFLECTS THE CONCERNS OF COUNTY LIBRARIES, PUBLIC LIBRARIES,AND REGIONAL FILM CENTRES, AND INCLUDES THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A STATEWIDERECIPROCAL BORROWING PROGRAMME. REPORT NOT AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
3672|PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN LOCAL COOPERATIVE SYSTEMS.     DEALS WITH NETWORKING AND ITS IMPLICATIONS FOR MEMBER LIBRARIES OF ACOOPERATIVE SYSTEM IN NEW YORK STATE. AFTER DESCRIBING BRIEFLY LIBRARYDEVELOPMENTS IN THE STATE, DISCUSSES THE HISTORY, ORGANISATION, AND FINANCINGOF THE NASSAU LIBRARY SYSTEM. THE SERVICE PROGRAMME OF THE SYSTEM IS OUTLINED,AND THESE ACTIVITIES ARE THEN RELATED TO STATEWIDE, REGIONAL, BICOUNTY, ANDLOCAL ACTIVITIES WHICH HAVE AN IMPACT ON LOCAL LIBRARY SERVICE. THE PROBLEMSOF NEW YORK SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT ARE MENTIONED, AND THE BENEFITS OFPARTICIPATION IN A SYSTEM PROGRAMME ARE DISCUSSED.
3673|PUBLIC LIBRARIES AND NETWORKING' A BIBLIOGRAPHIC ESSAY.     MOST OF THE LITERATURE ON THE PARTICIPATION OF PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN COOPERATIVEACTIVITIES DEALS WITH THEIR EXPANSION FROM LOCAL ENTITIES TO MULTITYPESYSTEMS. WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THIS EVOLUTION, TOPICS OF SPECIAL INTERESTHAVE BEEN' APPROPRIATE UNITS OF SERVICE; LEGAL AND POLITICAL CONSIDERATIONS;STIMULUS OF LEGISLATION; ROLE OF STATE LIBRARY AGENCIES; FINANCIAL ASPECTS;HUMAN FACTORS; AND AUTOMATION IN NETWORKING. THE LITERATURE REVIEWED WAS VASTBUT WAS DEFICIENT IN COMPREHENSIVE SYNTHESES, IN RIGOROUS, LARGE-SCALEEVALUATION OF NETWORKING, AND IN STUDIES FOCUSING SOLELY ON PUBLIC LIBRARIES.
3674|POLITICS OF LOCAL INTERLIBRARY COOPERATION.     SOCIAL AND POLITICAL ISSUES ARE KEY FACTORS IN DEVELOPING COOPERATION AMONG USPUBLIC LIBRARIES. EXPERIENCES IN PUBLIC LIBRARY COOPERATION HAVE SHOWN THATTHE ACCEPTANCE OF COOPERATION AS AN IDEAL, PATRON REACTION AND ACCEPTANCE,LOCAL PRIDE AND CONTROL, AND THE EDUCATION AND COOPERATION OF THE LIBRARYBOARD, LOCAL GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, AND FUNDING AGENCIES ARE ALL IMPORTANT INPROVIDING THE BEST POSSIBLE FRAMEWORK FOR COOPERATION. THE COMMITMENT TO ANDUNDERSTANDING OF THE IMPLICATIONS, CHANGES, AND MODIFICATIONS THAT COOPERATIONREQUIRES ARE ALSO IMPORTANT. REALISATION THAT INTERPRETATION OF WHATCOOPERATION MEANS AND THAT UNEQUAL CONTRIBUTIONS CAN BE EXPECTED ARE NECESSARYSTEPS IN DEVELOPING EFFECTIVE ARRANGEMENTS AMONG PUBLIC LIBRARIES.
3675|PUBLIC LIBRARY NETWORKING VIEWED FROM A STATE LIBRARY AGENCY.     ESPECIALLY OVER THE PAST 30| YEARS, US STATE LIBRARY AGENCIES HAVE PLAYED AMAJOR ROLE IN THE PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT OF COOPERATIVE AND NETWORKINGACTIVITIES AMONG PUBLIC LIBRARIES AND BETWEEN PUBLIC LIBRARIES AND OTHER TYPESOF LIBRARIES. THESE ACTIVITIES HAVE BEEN CARRIED OUT IN A GREAT VARIETY OFWAYS, WITH EACH STATE REACTING TO ITS OWN DEMOGRAPHIC, GOVERNMENTAL, ANDLIBRARY REALITIES. THE FEDERAL LIBRARY SERVICES AND CONSTRUCTION ACT HAS BEENA MAJOR CONSTRUCTIVE FORCE ENABLING STATE LIBRARY AGENCIES TO BE EFFECTIVELEADERS IN COOPERATIVE AND NETWORKING ACTIVITIES. STATE LIBRARY AGENCIES ANDPUBLIC LIBRARIES WORKING TOGETHER CAN CONTINUE TO EXTEND LIBRARY SERVICES BYTAKING LEADERSHIP IN NETWORKING ACTIVITIES.
3676|SCHOOL/PUBLIC LIBRARY COOPERATION. A STATE OF THE ART REVIEW.     THIS REVIEW IS PRESENTED AS A RESPONSE TO MAJOR QUESTIONS RELATED TO SCHOOLAND PUBLIC LIBRARY COOPERATION. ITS SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES ARE TO' (1|) INDICATETHE PRESENT STATUS OF COOPERATION BETWEEN SCHOOL AND PUBLIC LIBRARIES; (2|)PRESENT A HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE WITHIN WHICH TO EVALUATE THE PROGRESS OFCURRENT EFFORTS; (3|) IDENTIFY FUTURE TRENDS AND DIRECTIONS; (4|) POINT OUTBARRIERS TO COOPERATION AND FACTORS LEADING TO ITS SUCCESS; (5|) SUGGESTOUTSTANDING SOURCES WHICH CONTAIN RELEVANT INSIGHTS ABOUT SCHOOL/PUBLICLIBRARY COOPERATION; AND (6|) IDENTIFY SOME REPRESENTATIVE COOPERATIVEACTIVITIES. REPORT NOT AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
3677|THE AMALGAMATION OF A SMALL AND A LARGER LIBRARY.     IN THE NETHERLANDS THE PUBLIC LIBRARY AUTHORITY OF VLAGTEWEDDE, WHICH WITH APOPULATION OF 16|,500| INHABITANTS WOULD HAVE BEEN COMPELLED UNDER THE DUTCHPUBLIC LIBRARY ACT TO SURRENDER ITS LIBRARY SERVICE TO THE COUNTY COUNCIL,COMBINED IN 1978| WITH THE NEARBY TOWN OF STADSKANAAL WITH A POPULATION OF34|,000| TO PROVIDE A JOINT LIBRARY SERVICE. THE COMBINED LIBRARY SERVICE NOWHAS ITS MAIN LIBRARY AT STADSKANAAL, 5| BRANCH LIBRARIES AND A MOBILE LIBRARYWITH A TOTAL COLLECTION OF APPROXIMATELY 135|,000| BOOKS AND RECORDS. THERE ARE16|,600| REGISTERED BORROWERS AND LOANS IN 1980| TOTALLED 750|,000|. LIBRARYSERVICES THROUGHOUT THE REGION HAVE BEEN IMPROVED BY THE CREATION OFDOCUMENTATION CENTRES IN SCHOOLS AND BY THE SETTING UP OF A LIBRARY SERVICEFOR HOUSEBOUND READERS.
3678|ON THE EDGE OF THE DESERT' STATEMENT OF ACHIEVEMENTS BY THE PUBLIC LIBRARIES.     THE IDEA THAT INCREASES IN LOANS AND STOCKS WOULD BRING ABOUT PROPORTIONALINCREASES IN FINANCE, ACCOMMODATION AND STAFF HAS PROVED INCORRECT. STATISTICSON LOANS AND STOCKS CONCEAL WEAKNESSES WITHIN A LIBRARY AND THE UNFULFILLEDWISHES OF READERS. THERE IS NO PROSPECT AT PRESENT OF A LIBRARY LAW AND SALARYNEGOTIATIONS HAVE STOPPED. ONLY 10|% OF THE POPULATION USE LIBRARIES' MOREDEDICATED LIBRARIANS ARE NEEDED TO DEVELOP SOCIAL LIBRARIANSHIP. FREEDOM INBOOK SELECTION IS OFTEN THREATENED BY THE ATTITUDE OF LOCAL OFFICIALS AND BYCONDITIONS ON THE BOOK MARKET. PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN GERMANY HAVE DEVELOPED NOTIN A UNIFIED FASHION BUT THROUGH A VARIETY OF HISTORICAL CAUSES. THE BEST CUREOF THESE PROBLEMS WOULD BE AN OPEN AND CRITICAL DIALOGUE BETWEEN LIBRARIANSAND POLITICIANS.
3679|THE FUTURE DEVELOPMENT OF LIBRARIES AND INFORMATION SERVICES.     CONTAINS 2| REPORTS ON THE FUTURE DEVELOPMENT OF LIBRARIES AND INFORMATIONSERVICES; 'THE ORGANISATIONAL AND POLICY FRAMEWORK' AND 'WORKING TOGETHERWITHIN A NATIONAL FRAMEWORK'. THE FIRST REPORT WAS SUBMITTED TO THE MINISTERFOR THE ARTS IN 1979| AND IS CONCERNED MAINLY WITH LIBRARIES. THE SECOND REPORTWAS SUBMITTED IN 1981| AND IS CONCERNED MAINLY WITH THE APPLICATION OF NEWTECHNOLOGY TO LIBRARIES AND INFORMATION SERVICES AND WITH THE IMPROVEMENT INCOOPERATION AT LOCAL, REGIONAL AND NATIONAL LEVEL.
3680|THE LONG RANGE PLAN FOR STATEWIDE LIBRARY DEVELOPMENT IN CONNECTICUT,1980|-1985|.     PREPARED TO SATISFY REQUIREMENTS OF THE LIBRARY SERVICES AND CONSTRUCTION ACT(LCSA) PL 95|-123|, THIS LONG-RANGE PLAN PRESENTS LIBRARY SERVICE GOALS ANDOBJECTIVES FOR THE CONNECTICUT LIBRARY SYSTEM FOR THE NEXT 5| YEARS. THEBACKGROUND OF LONG RANGE PLANNING, THE PLANNING PROCESS, AND PROBLEMS TO BEOVERCOME ARE DEVELOPED WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF FEDERAL GUIDELINES FORPROGRAMMES AND EXPENSES. REPORT NOT AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
3681|BUILDING THE FUTURE. THE ALABAMA LONG RANGE PROGRAM FOR LIBRARY DEVELOPMENT,1980|-1984|.     BASED PRIMARILY ON IDENTIFIED NEEDS FOR LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SERVICES FORTHE CITIZENS OF ALABAMA, THIS REPORT DISCUSSES LIBRARY AND INFORMATION NEEDSIN THE CONTEXTS OF PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVICES, SPECIAL SERVICES FOR SPECIALCONSTITUENCIES, AND INTERLIBRARY COOPERATION; PROVIDES A DETAILED OUTLINE OFTHE MISSION, GOALS, AND OBJECTIVES OF THE STATE'S PUBLIC LIBRARY SYSTEM; ANDDETAILS THE POLICIES, CRITERIA, PRIORITIES, AND PROCEDURES FOR THE ALLOCATIONOF LIBRARY SERVICES AND CONSTRUCTION ACT (LSCA) FUNDS. REPORT NOT AVAILABLEFROM NTIS.
3682|A FIRE IN THE DEBATE ABOUT THE NEW LIBRARY BILL.     DISCUSSES THE LIBRARY BILL PROPOSED BY THE DANISH CHRISTIAN PEOPLES' PARTY, AMINORITY PARTY WHOSE PROPOSAL HAS NO CHANCE OF BECOMING LAW, BUT MIGHT YETINFLUENCE THE RULING SOCIAL DEMOCRATS' PROPOSAL. THE C.P.P. SUPPORTS THELIBRARY COMMISSION'S MINORITY REPORT AND PREFERS THAT PUBLIC LIBRARIES AREADMINISTERED BY THE MINISTRY OF CULTURAL AFFAIRS, WHILE RESEARCH, EDUCATIONALAND SCHOOL LIBRARIES COME UNDER THE MINISTRY OF EDUCATION. BUT UNLIKE THEMINORITY REPORT, IT SUGGESTS THAT NO NON-BOOK MATERIALS AND CULTURALACTIVITIES SHOULD RECEIVE STATE SUPPORT, AND THAT IT SHOULD BE UP TO THEINDIVIDUAL AUTHORITY WHETHER TO CHARGE FOR THESE OR FINANCE THEM OUT OF THELOCAL RATES. EXEMPTED FROM THIS PROPOSAL SHOULD BE LENDING OF AUDIO-VISUALMATERIALS TO THE DISABLED. IT SUPPORTS THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE LOCAL AUTHORITYAND ITS DECISIVE INFLUENCE ON BOOK SELECTION. A BLOCK GRANT SYSTEM OFFINANCING WOULD ALSO AID LOCAL INDEPENDENCE.
3683|INFLEXIBLE CONTROL SYSTEM.     COMPLAINS OF THE NECESSITY FOR NORWEGIAN BRANCH LIBRARIES TO MAKE SEPARATEANNUAL RETURNS TO SATISFY THE COUNTY LIBRARY AND THE NATIONAL LIBRARY OFFICE.1| COORDINATED REPORT COMPILED BY THE CENTRAL LIBRARY SHOULD BE SUFFICIENT.SEPARATE RETURNS CAN BE POSITIVELY MISLEADING, SINCE, FOR INSTANCE, BOOKSTRANSFERRED OR CIRCULATING WITHIN A LIBRARY SYSTEM CANNOT BE ACCURATELYRECORDED. PUTS FORWARD PROPOSALS TO REDUCE THE TIME SPENT ON STATISTICS; THETYPE REQUIRED TO JUSTIFY THE LIBRARY'S PLACE IN SOCIETY WERE TO BE THERESPONSIBILITY OF A SALARIED COMMITTEE OF LIBRARIANS. BOOKSTOCK STANDARDSWOULD ALSO BE MORE VIABLE IF FORMULATED FOR 1| AUTHORITY, WITH THE NECESSARYDIVISIONS INTO CENTRAL LIBRARY AND BRANCHES. THE STATUS AND FUNCTION OF THECOUNTY LIBRARIANS' CONFERENCE IS QUERIED, AND THE RIGHT OF WORKERS'ORGANISATIONS TO REPRESENTATION ON THE NATIONAL LIBRARY COUNCIL IS STRESSED.
3684|COPYRIGHT AND A RESERVE READING ROOM' FROM MENACE TO OFFICE ROUTINE.     DISCUSSES THE EFFECTS OF THE US COPYRIGHT REVISION ACT OF 1976| ON THE SERVICE,BUDGET EXPENDITURE AND OFFICE PROCEDURES OF THE PENN STATE UNIVERSITY'SLIBRARY RESERVE READING ROOM. DESCRIBES HOW THE LIBRARY, WHICH HELD ACONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF MULTIPLE COPIES OF PHOTOCOPIED MATERIAL DEALT WITH THENEW LAW'S SECTION OF LIBRARY REPRODUCTION. DISCUSSES SOME OF THE SOLUTIONSWHICH WERE FOUND TO THE PROBLEMS CAUSED BY THE ACT, INCLUDING' PURCHASING BACKISSUES, REPRINTS OR ADDITIONAL COPIES OF BOOKS; AND MORE FULLY TAKINGADVANTAGE OF THE UNIVERSAL SERIALS AND BOOK EXCHANGE. INDICATES SOME ISSUESREGARDING THE COPYRIGHT LAW AND RESERVE ROOMS THAT NEED RESOLUTION.
3685|MBO AND THE PUBLIC LIBRARY.     WINDSOR, CONNECTICUT HAS A PUBLIC LIBRARY STAFFED BY 5| PROFESSIONALS AND 10|CLERICAL PERSONNEL. IN 1975|, THE TOWN OF WINDSOR AND THE LIBRARY AS ONE OF ITSDEPARTMENTS, ADOPTED MANAGEMENT BY OBJECTIVES. REVIEWS THE SUCCESSES ANDFAILURES OF MBO IN THE CONTENT OF THE LIBRARY. TASKS AND ACTIVITIES WERE PUTIN WIDE FUNCTIONAL COMPARTMENTS-COLLECTION MANAGEMENT, CIRCULATION MANAGEMENT,LIBRARY PROMOTION, INFORMATION SERVICES, AND EVENTS MANAGEMENT. DESCRIBES THEPROBLEMS INVOLVED IN THE DEVELOPMENT AND EXECUTION OF OBJECTIVES. WHILSTLIBRARY COLLEAGUES HAVE NOT BEEN OVERLY INTERESTED IN MBO, THE RAISING OFIMPORTANT QUESTIONS AND THE ATTEMPTS TO ANSWER THEM MORE THAN JUSTIFIES ALLTHE TOIL THAT MBO HAS REQUIRED.
3686|SOURCES OF FUNDING FOR VIRGINIA LIBRARIES.     THE REPORT IS DESIGNED TO (1|) EDUCATE NON-LIBRARIANS AS TO HOW VIRGINIALIBRARIES ARE FUNDED, (2|) INFORM LIBRARIANS OF FUNDING OUTSIDE THEIRPARTICULAR SPECIALTY, (3|) SUGGEST THE ADEQUACY AND INADEQUACY OF SUCH FUNDINGAND ITS DEPENDABILITY, AND (4|) OUTLINE THE FORMULAS BY WHICH FUNDS AREDISTRIBUTED. REPORT NOT AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
3687|ARE COUNTY LIBRARIES THREATENED?.     THE NORWEGIAN GOVERNMENT REPORT NOU 1979| PROPOSES THAT FROM 1981| STATE GRANTSTOWARDS COUNTY ADMINISTRATION SHOULD CEASE, BEING REPLACED BY ADDITIONAL TAXINCOME. THE INTENTION IS TO SIMPLIFY LOCAL GOVERNMENT FINANCIAL STRUCTURE ANDINCREASE THE COUNTIES' ADMINISTRATIVE RESPONSIBILITY AND AUTONOMY.CONCENTRATING ON TECHNICAL DETAILS, THE REPORT IGNORES THEIR EFFECT ONPROFESSIONS AND EMPLOYMENT IN THE AREAS CONCERNED. CULTURAL WORK IS DEFINED ASA VOLUNTARY ACTIVITY FOR COUNTIES, NOT REQUIRING OR MERITING STATE SUPPORT;LIBRARIES ARE CONSIDERED TO BE ALREADY UNDER SOME DEGREE OF STATE SUPERVISION.STATE SUPPORT HAS BEEN A STIMULUS TO CULTURAL LIFE IN RURAL AREAS, AND ITSREMOVAL WOULD BE A RETROGRADE STEP. THE PROPOSALS, IF IMPLEMENTED WITHOUTFURTHER CLARIFICATION OF LAWS, REGULATIONS AND AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY, COULDLEAD TO GREATLY VARYING STANDARDS OF LIBRARY SERVICE IN INDIVIDUAL COUNTIES,ALSO AFFECTING SCHOOLS AND ADULT EDUCATION. THIS WOULD BE DI RECTLY COUNTER TOTHE 'EQUALITY PRINCIPLE' IN THE CURRENT LIBRARY ACT.
3688|THE ALLOCATION OF STATE FUNDS TO PUBLIC LIBRARY SYSTEMS IN CALIFORNIA.     (DLS THESIS-UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT BERKELEY.) DISCUSSES THE EVOLUTION OFCALIFORNIA'S STATE POLICY REGARDING FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO PUBLIC LIBRARIESWHICH BEGAN WITH THE INVESTIGATIONS BY THE SUBCOMMITTEE ON LIBRARY PROBLEMS OFTHE ASSEMBLY INTERIM COMMITTEE ON EDUCATION FROM 1953|-57|. THIS LED TO THEESTABLISHMENT OF THE CALIFORNIA LIBRARY COMMISSION IN 1957|. TRACES THE WORK OFTHE COMMISSION AND THE EMPHASIS PLACED ON COOPERATION BETWEEN SMALL LIBRARIESIN ORDER TO MAKE MAXIMUM USE OF THE FUNDS AVAILABLE.
3689|PRICING OBJECTIVES FOR PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVICES.     OPPORTUNITIES AND PROBLEMS CONFRONTING A PUBLIC LIBRARY IN ITS PRICINGDECISION ARE RELATED TO ITS PRICING OBJECTIVES. EXAMINES 6| OBJECTIVES OF PRICEAND IDENTIFIES THE LIKELY OUTCOMES ASSOCIATED WITH EACH OBJECTIVE. THESEOBJECTIVES ARE MARKET EQUITY, SOCIAL EQUITY, MAXIMUM OPPORTUNITY FORPARTICIPATION, MAXIMISING REVENUE, RATIONING, AND COMMERCIAL SECTORENCOURAGEMENT. IT IS UNLIKELY THAT A LIBRARY WILL HAVE ONE OVERALL PRICINGOBJECTIVE WHICH IS APPLICABLE TO ALL THE SERVICES IT DELIVERS. THE PRICEULTIMATELY ADOPTED FOR ANY PARTICULAR SERVICE WILL DEPEND ON WHICH OBJECTIVESARE UPPERMOST IN PRIORITY AND WILL REPRESENT THE BEST COMPROMISE AMONGCONFLICTING OBJECTIVES.
3690|SYMPOSIUM ON GOVERNMENT, FINANCE AND LIBRARIES.     MARGARET SKED DISCUSSES THE ROLE OF SCHOOL LIBRARIES AND LIBRARIANS IN THELIGHT OF DEVELOPMENTS IN CURRICULA AND TEACHING METHODS AND CUTS IN LOCALGOVERNMENT EXPENDITURE IN SCOTLAND WHICH ARE HITTING EDUCATION PARTICULARLYHARD. ERIC SIMPSON DISCUSSES THE ROLE OF COLLEGE LIBRARIES AND THE EFFECTS ONTHEIR BUDGETS OF CUTS IN LOCAL AND CENTRAL GOVERNMENT SPENDING. NORMAN TURNERBRIEFLY STRESSES THE NEED TO CONVINCE THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES OF THE VALUE OFPUBLIC LIBRARIES WHEN ALLOTTING FUNDING.
3691|GREAT DIFFERENCES IN THE FINANCIAL POSITION AND LEVEL OF SERVICES OF RESEARCHLIBRARIES.     COMMENTS ON THE SECTIONS OF A REPORT BY THE RESEARCH PLANNING COUNCIL' 2|THECONDITIONS FOR RESEARCH IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR1| WHICH DEAL WITH RESEARCHLIBRARIES. THE CONCLUSION IS THAT THE REDUCTION OF FUNDS AVAILABLE FORACQUISITION OF LITERATURE HAS LED TO SEVERE PROBLEMS FOR RESEARCH. ANALYSIS OFTHE DEVELOPMENT IN THE 1970|S SHOWS INCREASE IN EXPENDITURE ON STAFF AND FALLIN THE REAL VALUE OF THAT FOR ACQUISITIONS, TOGETHER WITH A DOUBLING OFISSUES. THE COMEMNTS ON LIBRARIES ARE SCATTERED THROUGHOUT THE REPORT, BUT CANBE CLASSED AS THOSE THAT MENTION' LIBRARIES WITHOUT PROBLEMS OF ACQUISITION,OR LIBRARIES WHERE PROBLEMS HAVE NOT YET ARISEN, AND LIBRARIES WITHCONSIDERABLE PROBLEMS. ARTS FACULTIES HAVE SEEN AN INCREASE IN SUBJECTS ANDFOREIGN SPECIALISED LITERATURE COINCIDING WITH A DECREASE IN BOOK GRANTS. INTHE NATURAL SCIENCE FACULTIES, INSTITUTE LIBRARIES HAVE BEEN FORCED TO ACQUIREBOOKS WHICH WOULD NORMALLY HAVE BEEN BORROWED FROM A RESEARCH LIBRARY; GAPSARE APPEARING IN RUNS OF PERIODICALS, AND REFERENCE WORKS ARE IN SHORT SUPPLY.SERVICE LEVEL HAS GONE DOWN AS A RESULT OF UNDERMANNING OF LIBRARIES. SOMELIBRARIES, FOR EXAMPLE THOSE OF THE AGRICULTURAL AND THE COMMERCIAL HIGHSCHOOLS, STAND OUT AS PARTICULARLY HARD HIT.
3692|THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CENTRAL AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT' THE LOCAL VIEWPOINT.     DISCUSSES CUTS IN THE BUDGETS FOR LIBRARIES IN SCOTLAND IN THE LIGHT OF THEGOVERNMENT'S CUTS IN PUBLIC SPENDING. ARGUES THAT MORE EFFICIENT AND SLIMMERSERVICES WILL BE NEEDED IN FUTURE WHICH ARE MANNED BY MORE HIGHLY SPECIALISEDAND ADAPTABLE LIBRARIANS WHOSE SERVICES ARE RECOGNISED BY ADEQUATE PAY LEVELS.STRESSES THE NEED FOR STANDARDS FOR SERVICES AND MEANS OF MEASURING LEVELS OFPERFORMANCE.
3693|LONG RANGE BUDGET PLANNING IN LARGE PUBLIC LIBRARIES.     ARGUES THAT IF A LARGE PUBLIC LIBRARY MAKES A PRACTICE OF GATHERINGINFORMATION ON WHICH TO BUILD BUDGET REQUESTS, THE TIME CONSUMING DATAGATHERING CAN BE REDUCED IN SUBSEQUENT YEARS BY EXAMINING THE OVERALLREQUESTED GROWTH RATE FOR THE SYSTEM AND ADJUSTING THE FIGURES WHERE NEEDED TOBRING IT IN LINE WITH WHAT IS FEASIBLE. THE ADJUSTED FIGURES CAN THEN BERETURNED TO THE REQUESTING LIBRARIANS FOR THEM TO SEE WHAT CAN BE EXPECTED ASA REQUEST. DEMONSTRATES HOW, IN TIMES WHEN FUNDS ARE SCARCE, THIS PRACTICEWILL ACT AS AN INFORMATIONAL AND DECISION-MAKING TOOL AND WILL SERVE TO ADJUSTLIBRARY NEEDS TO ZERO-BASE BUDGETING PRACTICES.
3694|WORD PROCESSOR (HERMES WP-6000|) AND ITS APPLICATION TO LIBRARY WORK.     A WORD PROCESSOR, HERMES WP-6000|, WAS INSTALLED IN TOKYO METROPOLITANGERONTOLOGY CENTER LIBRARY IN FEB 80|. DETAILED DESCRIPTIONS ARE PROVIDED FORTHE SYSTEM COMPONENTS, WHICH INCLUDE A CRT DISPLAYER, DISK DRIVE, KEYBOARD, APRINTER AND A FLOPPY DISK. THE LIBRARY APPLICATIONS OF WORD PROCESSORS AREEXPLORED IN THE AREA OF CATALOGUE CARD PRODUCTION, BOOK CATALOGUE PRODUCTION,AND CURRENT FOREIGN SERIAL RECORD MAINTENANCE.
3695|THE USE OF AUTOMATED DATA PROCESSING IN LIBRARIES' IDEAS FOR A NEW VIEWPOINT.     ALTHOUGH LIBRARIANS FORMERLY ADOPTED A DEFENSIVE ATTITUDE WHEN INTRODUCINGAUTOMATED DATA PROCESSING, ITS USE RESULTED IN ERGONOMIC IMPROVEMENTS AND MOREINTERESTING WORK FOR SOME STAFF. THE USE OF AUTOMATED DATA PROCESSING CAN,HOWEVER, CAUSE STRESS AND MONOTONY, THE CONTROL OF WORK AND HUMAN POTENTIAL BYMACHINES, INCREASED ISOLATION OF INDIVIDUALS, THE DOWNGRADING OF SOME LIBRARYPOSTS AND THE LOSS OF A FRIENDLY ATMOSPHERE FOR READERS. IF THE HUMAN TOUCH ISTO BE RETAINED IN LIBRARIES, NEW STANDARDS ARE REQUIRED. GOOD COMMUNICATIONMUST BE DEVELOPED BETWEEN STAFF MEMBERS AND BETWEEN STAFF AND READERS. STAFFWORK MUST BE REORGANISED AND THE TENDENCY TO GIGANTISM IN THE USE OFAUTOMATION AVOIDED.
3696|COMPUTER BASICS FOR LIBRARIANS AND INFORMATION SCIENTISTS.     AN INTRODUCTORY TEXT ON COMPUTERS AND DATA PROCESSING WHICH PROVIDE A BROADOVERVIEW OF THE FIELD, WITH AN EMPHASIS ON THE NEEDS AND INTERESTS OF THELIBRARY AND INFORMATION SCIENCE COMMUNITY. MANY ASPECTS OF COMPUTING SYSTEMSARE DISCUSSED RANGING FROM HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE CONCEPTS TO PERSONNEL ANDDOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS. SECTIONS ON STORAGE CONSIDERATIONS AND PROGRAMMINGLANGUAGES STRESS ISSUES OF PARTICULAR IMPORTANCE IN LIBRARY COMPUTING SYSTEMS.AT THE SAME TIME, SPECIAL ATTENTION HAS BEEN GIVEN TO THOSE TOPICS COMMONLYIGNORED IN BOOKS DEALING WITH LIBRARY AUTOMATION. FOR EXAMPLE, OPERATINGSYSTEMS AND THE INTERNAL METHODS OF COMPUTER MEMORY MANAGEMENT ARE DISCUSSED.
3697|THE EFFECTS OF LIBRARY AUTOMATION ON STAFF AND READERS MUST BE INVESTIGATED.     RESEARCH HAS CONCENTRATED ON THE TECHNICAL ASPECTS OF LIBRARY AUTOMATION ANDNEGLECTED THE SOCIOLOGICAL ASPECTS, SO THAT OPINION ON THE POSITIVE ANDNEGATIVE EFFECTS IS SHARPLY DIVIDED. THE MAIN PURPOSE OF AUTOMATION IS TOINCREASE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF LIBRARY PROCEDURES; SERVICE CHANGES ARE STILLREGARDED AS SIDE-EFFECTS. AUTOMATION'S VALUE MUST BE JUDGED IN TERMS OF THEAVERAGE NON-ACADEMIC READER. THE TIME SAVED FOR STAFF THROUGH AUTOMATION OFROUTINE PROCEDURES MUST BE USED FOR READER-ORIENTED ACTIVITIES, FOR WHICHFURTHER STAFF TRAINING SHOULD BE PROVIDED. THE RESULTS OF EXPERIENCES IN THISFIELD FROM LIBRARIES ABROAD SHOULD BE STUDIED CAREFULLY.
3698|MEDIA CONTROL REPORT WITHOUT PERSPECTIVES.     COMMENTS ON 2|AUTOMATED MEDIA CONTROL IN THE PUBLIC LIBRARY, 1|A JOINT REPORT BYTHE NORWEGIAN ASSOCIATION OF MUNICIPAL LIBRARY WORKERS AND THE COMPUTERCOMMITTEE. THE WORKING PARTY ON PILOT PROJECTS DOES NOT DELINEATE LONG-TERMPERSPECTIVES FOR DEVELOPMENT, MAKING IT DIFFICULT TO SEE ITS PROPOSALS AS PARTOF A WHOLE. THE SWEDISH SITUATION OF 2| SEPARATE DATA SYSTEMS FOR SPECIAL ANDPUBLIC LIBRARIES, RESULTING IN DUPLICATION OF WORK AND UNDER-UTILISEDRESOURCES, MUST BE AVOIDED IN NORWAY; THE REPORT IS CRITICISED FOR NOTCONSIDERING COMPUTER DEVELOPMENT IN PUBLIC AND SPECIAL LIBRARIES TOGETHER. ITALSO FAILS TO SPECIFY THE EFFECTS OF COMPUTERISATION ON LIBRARY STAFFS,BORROWERS AND FINANCE. THE COMMITTEE REGARDS ISSUE CONTROL AS THE ROUTINE MOSTREQUIRING COMPUTERISATION, BUT MANY PUBLIC LIBRARIES HAVE OTHER PRIORITIES,SUCH AS OVERDUE RECALL WORK. EASILY-AMASSED STATISTICS MUST NOT BE ALLOWED TOBUILD UP EXTRA WORK. SEVERAL PARAGRAPHS FROM THE REPORT ARE SELECTED FORDETAILED COMMENT.
3699|COMPUTERS IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES.     A NORWEGIAN COUNTY LIBRARIANS' CONFERENCE (SEPT 80|) DEFINED 2| MAIN PURPOSES OFAUTOMATION' (1|) LIBRARY TECHNOLOGY AND ADMINISTRATIVE ROUTINES; (2|) INDEXING,STORAGE AND RETRIEVAL OF INFORMATION. NORWEGIAN PUBLIC LIBRARIES SHOULDPROBABLY BEGIN WITH ADMINISTRATIVE ROUTINES AND PROCEED GRADUALLY, WHILEDISCUSSING MAJOR LONG-TERM OBJECTIVES, SUCH AS' AN INTEGRATED SYSTEM; ADECENTRALISED SYSTEM UTILISING CENTRAL SERVICES; LIBRARIES NOT USING COMPUTERSTHEMSELVES, BUT LARGELY DEPENDENT ON COMPUTERISED PRODUCTIONS. THE LIBRARYCENTRE WILL EVENTUALLY ACT AS A DATA BASE FOR PUBLIC LIBRARY LITERATURE AND ACENTRE FOR PUBLIC LIBRARY COMPUTER OPERATIONS. LOCAL SYSTEMS ARE VIABLE ONLYFOR THE LARGEST LIBRARIES; SMALL AND MEDIUM-SIZED LIBRARIES MUST BE LINKED TOA CENTRAL AUTHORITY, AND HENCE TO THE RESOURCES OF THE LARGE LIBRARIES. PUBLICLIBRARIES MUST FORMULATE THEIR OWN POLICY FOR AUTOMATION, EVALUATING SYSTEMSACCORDINGLY.
3700|GROUNDS FOR THE AUTOMATION PROPOSAL.     THE NORWEGIAN COMPUTER COMMITTEE WILL PRESENT A REPORT ON COMPUTERISATION IN1982|. THE ASSOCIATION OF MUNICIPAL LIBRARY WORKERS CONSIDERS THAT A DEFINITERULING ON ITS ATTITUDE TO INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IS NEEDED BEFORE THEN.STRESSING THAT IT DOES NOT OPPOSE THE NEW TECHNOLOGY, THAT POTENTIAL USERSMUST TAKE PART IN DEVELOPING THE SYSTEMS, AND THAT STRICT QUALITATIVESTANDARDS ARE NECESSARY, IT PRESENTS A 2|-PART PROPOSAL RELATING TO TRADEUNIONS AND LIBRARY POLICY.
3701|THE ART OF RUNNING A DATA LIBRARY.     DATA TECHNOLOGY HAS APPEARED AT THE RIGHT TIME TO HELP LIBRARIANS WITH THEGREATLY INCREASED WORKLOAD OF RECENT YEARS. RETROSPECTIVE LITERATURE SEARCHINGAND CURRENT LITERATURE AWARENESS, FOR INSTANCE, CAN BENEFIT GREATLY FROMAUTOMATION. FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS ARE LIKELY IN THE FIELDS OF SOCIAL ANDCOMMUNITY INFORMATION SERVICES, FULLER INDEXING TO AID IDENTIFICATION IN THEHUMANITIES, CATALOGUING OF LOCAL COLLECTIONS, AND INDEXING OF AUDIO-VISUALMATERIAL. ALL PUBLIC LIBRARIES SHOULD SET ABOUT INFORMING STAFF AND PUBLIC ONTHE QUESTION OF COMPUTERISATION; THE WORKING PARTY RECENTLY APPOINTED SHOULDINTENSIFY THEIR DISCUSSIONS ON THE SWEDISH BUMS SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT ANDAUTOMATION IN GENERAL; AND CONTACTS SHOULD BE STRENGTHENED ETWEEN CULTURAL ANDLIBRARY ORGANISATIONS WITH A VIEW TO DISCUSSING AUTOMATION IN SWEDISH PUBLICLIBRARIES.
3702|NTL'S COMPUTERISATION WORK AT OSLO UNIVERSITY LIBRARY.     MEMBERS OF NORSK TJENESTEMANNLAG (THE NORWEGIAN ASSOCIATION OF PUBLICSERVANTS) EMPLOYED IN OSLO UNIVERSITY LIBRARY SET UP THEIR OWN GROUP IN1977|-78|, AND ESTABLISHED A WORKING PARTY TO DEFINE THEIR PROFESSIONAL POLICYON COMPUTERISATION. TOPICS HAVE INCLUDED DISCUSSION ON RECENT OFFICIALSTATEMENTS ON THE FRAMEWORK OF DATA SYSTEMS; DISTRIBUTION OF INFORMATION TOSHOP STEWARDS AND EMPLOYEES; TRAINING COURSES; LIAISON OFFICERS; CONTACTMEETINGS; COOPERATION AMONG PROFESSIONAL ORGANISATIONS IN OSLO UNIVERSITYLIBRARY; STATEMENTS ON CONCRETE PROJECTS; DEMANDS REGARDING COMPUTERISATIONDEVELOPMENT; REPRESENTATION ON RELEVANT BODIES; WORKING CONDITIONS AND HOURSAT TERMINALS; NEED FOR SPECIFIC STATEMENTS ON LOCAL DATA SYSTEMS;ADMINISTRATION OF NATIONAL SYSTEMS; AND CONTACT WITH COLLEAGUES IN OTHERLIBRARIES. IN OSLO UNIVERSITY LIBRARY PROGRAMMES OF COMPUTER USE ARE AT ACOMPARATIVELY ADVANCED STAGE OF DEVELOPMENT, SO FAR WITHOUT MAJOR CONSEQUENCES FOR INDIVIDUAL STAFF. THE WORKING PARTY'S EFFORTS HAVE PRODUCEDGUIDELINES ON CERTAIN PROBLEMS, AND CONTRIBUTED TO THE COOPERATIVE BODY OFWORK ON COMPUTERISATION BY PROFESSIONAL LIBRARIANS.
3703|LIBRARY PLANNING FOR FUTURE NETWORKS.     AUTOMATION DEVELOPMENTS OF INDIVIDUAL LIBRARIES ARE VIEWED AS LEADING TOWARDINVOLVEMENT IN NETWORKS. THE PRIMARY ISSUES OF MACHINE-READABLE RECORDFORMATS, HOLDINGS FORMATS MECHANISMS FOR UPDATING MACHINE-READABLE DATA BASES,AND SYSTEM INTERFACES FOR HARDWARE, SOFTWARE, AND OPERATING SYSTEMS NEED TO BEADDRESSED IF THE LOCAL DEVELOPMENTS ARE TO BE A STEP TOWARD THE LIBRARY'SEVENTUAL NETWORKING CAPABILITIES. LIBRARIES AND THE BIBLIOGRAPHIC NETWORKS AREALL PROGRESSING IN THEIR USE OF COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY, BUT NOT NECESSARILYTOWARD A COMMON GOAL.
3704|NETWORK ORGANIZATION' CURRENT STATUS AND CONCERNS.     DESCRIBES THE BASIC ASPECTS OF LIBRARY NETWORK ORGANISATION IN THE USA. PAYSPARTICULAR ATTENTION TO THE ORGANISATIONAL AND GOVERNANCE STRUCTURES THAT HAVEBEEN DEVELOPED BY THESE NETWORKS. BOTH THE STATE AND MULTISTATE NETWORKS ANDTHE 3| MAJOR NATIONAL NETWORK ORGANISATIONS (OCLC, INC., RLG/RLIN, AND WLN) AREDESCRIBED. IN ADDITION, ORGANISATIONAL ISSUES OF CURRENT CONCERN INCLUDINGJURISDICTIONAL PROBLEMS, NATIONAL COORDINATION, AND THE CONTROL AND DIRECTIONOF NETWORK ACTIVITIES ARE DISCUSSED.
3705|LIBRARY NETWORKS.     THE MOST EFFICIENT TYPE OF NETWORK HAS GLOBAL AS WELL AS LOCAL ELEMENTS THATPROVIDE SYSTEM STANDARDS AS WELL AS LOCAL FLEXIBILITY. SUCH A NETWORKSTRUCTURE IS NOW POSSIBLE DUE TO COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY. THE RESULT OF THISDEVELOPMENT WILL BE THE INTEGRATION OF LARGE-SCALE LIBRARY SERVICES WITH THEUSER-ORIENTED SERVICES OF LOCAL LIBRARIES TO CREATE A NATIONAL INFORMATIONNETWORK.
3706|LCS' AUTOMATED RESOURCE SHARING IN ILLINOIS.     THE LIBRARY COMPUTER SYSTEM (LCS) NETWORK IN ILLINOIS PROVIDES CIRCULATIONCONTROL FOR ITS MEMBER LIBRARIES.

IT HAS HOWEVER NO REAL INFLUENCE ON LIBRARY POLICY. FURTHER ADVANCESDEPEND ON INCREASED FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND AN ACTIVE MEMBERSHIP. IT IS ANESSENTIAL LINK BETWEEN LIBRARY STAFF AND THE ASSOCIATION OF LOCAL AUTHORITIES.BETTER-ORGANISED COOPERATION WITH OTHER LIBRARY BODIES IS IMPORTANT. THEINFLUENCE OF LIBRARY WORKERS MUST BE STRENGTHENED IN MAJOR FIELDS CONCERNINGLIBRARY POLICY, SUCH AS THE NATIONAL LIBRARY COUNCIL, LIBRARY EDUCATION, ANDCOMPUTERISATION.

THE UNSUITABILITY OFMAJOR EXISTING CLASSIFICATION SYSTEMS FOR USE WITH THEATRE COLLECTIONS HASPROMPTED LIBRARIANS TO SEEK ALTERNATIVES, SUCH AS MODIFICATIONS AND ORIGINALCLASSIFICATIONS. ADDITIONALLY, COLLECTIONS OF NON-BOOK, OR 'FUGITIVE',THEATRICAL MEMORABILIA ARE PRACTICALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO CATALOGUE PROPERLY, GIVENTHE DESPERATE FINANCIAL SITUATION FACING MANY THEATRE COLLECTIONS. US SURVEYDATA ON CURRENT PRACTICES INDICATE A STRONG TREND TOWARD STANDARDISATION OFPROCEDURES IN CLASSIFYING, YET A CONTINUING DIVERSITY IN CATALOGUING METHODS.THE COMING OF COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY, ALONG WITH INCREASED AWARENESS AMONGTHEATRE LIBRARIANS AND INPUT FROM CONCERNED PROFESSIONAL ORGANISATIONS, MAYHELP ALLEVIATE SOME OF THESE PROBLEMS IN THE FUTURE.
3859|HOW DO LIBRARIES CATALOGUE.     THE WORKING GROUP ON CATALOGUING IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES SURVEYED THE FINNISHPUBLIC LIBRARY SYSTEM TO FIND OUT ABOUT CATALOGUING METHODS IN PUBLICLIBRARIES. 461| QUESTIONNAIRES WERE SENT AND 409| WERE RETURNED. THE WORKINGGROUP IS DESIGNING A COMPUTERISED CATALOGUING SYSTEM FOR PUBLIC LIBRARIES.JUST OVER 70|% OF THE RESPONDENTS USE FINNISH CATALOGUING RULES. JUST UNDER 50|%OF THE RESPONDENTS USE THEIR OWN SUBJECT INDEXING AND NEARLY 87|% OF THERESPONDENTS USE THE 1975| EDITION OF THE FINNISH CLASSIFICATION SCHEME BASED ONDEWEY. OVER 50|% USE THE CENTRALISED CATALOGUING SERVICE OF KIRJASTOPALVELU OY,AND NEARLY 60|% OF THE RESPONDING LIBRARY AUTHORITIES UNDERTAKE CENTRALISEDCATALOGUING.

3862|IN THE IRON AGE OF CATALOGUING.     CUTTER DESCRIBED THE 19|TH CENTURY HISTORY OF CATALOGUING AS THE GOLDEN AGE.EXTENDS THIS METAPHOR TO THE 20|TH CENTURY TO ELUCIDATE CURRENT TRENDS INCATALOGUING, ESPECIALLY THOSE INVOLVING THE USE OF THE COMPUTER. DOES THEAUTOMATION OF THE CATALOGUE REPRESENT A TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCE THAT WILL FREEUS FROM THE DIFFICULTIES OF MAIN ENTRY AND PROVIDE FOR CUTTER'S 2|ND OBJECT?ARGUES THAT THE CATALOGUING TRADITION OF PANIZZI, CUTTER, AND LUBETZKY WILL BEEVEN MORE VALID, AND THAT A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE PRINCIPLES OFCATALOGUING WILL BE REQUIRED IN THE FUTURE.
3863|BILD-INTEGRATED ONLINE SYSTEM FOR ECONOMIC AND BUSINESS LIBRARIES.     BILD, BIBLIOGRAPHIC INDEX OF LIBRARY DOCUMENTS IS THE NEW INTEGRATED ON-LINESYSTEM DEVELOPED FOR THE HELSINKI SCHOOL OF ECONOMICS LIBRARY. IT CONSISTS OFTHE ACQUISITION, CATALOGUING AND CLASSIFICATION FUNCTIONS OF THE LIBRARY.THERE IS ALSO A SEARCH PROGRAM FOR INFORMATION RETRIEVAL AVAILABLE. THE SYSTEMWAS TESTED DURING THE WINTER 1980|-81|.
3864|A SUBJECT ACCESS PROJECT (SAP)-A NEW TEST DATABASE FOR ESA-QUEST.     WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THE SUBJECT ACCESS PROJECT, A NEW VERSION OFON-LINE-CATALOGUE FOR MONOGRAPHIC PUBLICATIONS HAS BEEN DEVELOPED. IT IS ANEFFECTIVE AID FOR SEARCHES BY SUBJECT AS WELL AS BIBLIOGRAPHIC DATA. THE IDEAOF SAP IS TO PRODUCE SUBJECT DESCRIPTIONS OF BOOKS TAKEN FROM THE BOOKSTHEMSELVES AND TO MAKE MORE USE OF THE INHERENT ATTRIBUTES OF A PUBLICATION.TO MAKE POSSIBLE A DEEPER ANALYSIS OF THE EFFECTS OF SAP-INDEXING TECHNIQUETHE DATA BASE HAS BEEN CONVERTED TO ESA-QUEST AS A TEST FILE.

THE PICA NETWORK IS THE RESULT OF AN AGREEMENTCONCLUDED BY THE DUTCH GOVERNMENT AND UNIVERSITIES IN 1969|. IN ADDITION ANUMBER OF OTHER LIBRARIES, INCLUDING LEEUWAARDEN COUNTY LIBRARY AND THE PUBLICLIBRARIES OF AMSTERDAM AND THE HAGUE ARE MEMBERS OF THE NETWORK AS 'CUSTOMER'LIBRARIES. OVERALL SUPERVISION OF THE NETWORK IS MAINTAINED BY THE PICA BUREAULOCATED IN THE ROYAL LIBRARY. MEMBER LIBRARIES CONTRIBUTE CATALOGUE RECORDSVIA ON-LINE VISUAL DISPLAY TERMINALS DIRECT TO THE CENTRAL DATA BASE, FROMWHICH OUTPUT MAY BE OBTAINED IN THE FORM OF CATALOGUE CARDS, PAPER PRINTOUT ORMICROFICHE. IN 1982| THE CENTRAL DATA BASE WILL BE ADAPTED FOR USE INACQUISITION AND LOANS CONTROL SYSTEMS AND IN 1983| WILL BE USED FOR THENATIONAL INTERLIBRARY-LENDING NETWORK.
3866|THE CASE OF THE MISSING SUBTITLE.     WITH REFERENCE TO THE RELEVANT PASSAGES IN AACR2| AND ISBD(G), NOTES THEELIMINATION OF THE TERM 'SUBTITLE' AND THE RESULTANT DIFFICULTIES. SUBTITLESWILL NOT DISAPPEAR JUST BECAUSE THEY ARE NO LONGER CALLED BY THAT NAME. THETERM MUST BE REINSTATED IN THE OFFICIAL VOCABULARY OF CATALOGUING ANDOPERATIONAL DEFINITIONS OF 'TITLE PROPER' AND 'SUBTITLE' FORMULATED. SUCHACTION WOULD GO A LONG WAY TOWARDS UNIFORM IMPLEMENTATION OF THE RULES,LEAVING MUCH LESS TO THE INDIVIDUAL INTERPRETATION OF THE CATALOGUES ANDRESULTING IN GREATER ENTRY STANDARDISATION.
3867|REPORT OF THE TASK FORCE ON CATALOG USAGE.

AT THE MEETINGS IN MAY AND JUNE 81| THE DEUTSCHE BIBLIOTHEKSINSTITUT (GERMANLIBRARY INSTITUTE) COMMITTEE ON ALPHABETICAL CATALOGUING WAS CONCERNED WITHTHE DRAFT VERSION OF RAK-OB. LARGE PUBLIC LIBRARIES TEND TO ACCEPT THIS IFTHEY HAVE NOT ALREADY OPTED FOR THE ACADEMIC LIBRARY VERSION BUT SMALLERPUBLIC LIBRARIES STOCKING MAINLY GERMAN LANGUAGE MATERIAL ARE CRITICAL OF THEDRAFT. IT WAS DECIDED, THEREFORE, THAT ALTERNATIVES FOR SMALL PUBLIC LIBRARIESBE INCLUDED IN RAK-OB WITH REFERENCE TO PERSONAL NAMES, CORPORATE BODIES, UNITSUBJECT HEADINGS, PARALLEL HEADINGS, SUBORDINATE ENTRIES, ENTRIES FORMUSICALIA AND SOUND RECORDINGS FOR CHILDREN. RAK-OB AND RAK-WB MUST NOT DIFFERON BASIC PRINCIPLES BUT ARE TO BE KEPT PHYSICALLY SEPARATE. RAK-OB'S 2|ND DRAFTPLAN WILL BE PUBLISHED SOON.
3875|A CRITICAL SURVEY OF UNION CATALOGUES IN UNIVERSITIES.     EFFORTS MADE SINCE THE MID 19|TH CENTURY TO PRODUCE ALPHABETICAL UNIONCATALOGUES OF ALL BOOKS WITHIN A UNIVERSITY HAVE BEEN HAMPERED BY THEDIFFICULTY OF ACCESS TO SOME INSTITUTE LIBRARY STOCKS, BY INACCURATECATALOGUING IN INSTITUTE LIBRARIES AND BY THE QUESTIONABLE VALUE OF A CENTRALCATALOGUE WITHIN PURCHASING POLICY. SINCE 1970|, HOWEVER, PROFESSIONAL OPINIONHAS BEEN INCREASINGLY IN FAVOUR OF UNION CATALOGUES IN UNIVERSITIES; WORK INTHIS FIELD AT VARIOUS UNIVERSITIES IS DESCRIBED AND EVALUATED THROUGH ANALYSISOF INTERLIBRARY LOAN FIGURES. THESE CATALOGUES SHOULD BE PRODUCED ONLY WHENCERTAIN CONDITIONS PREVAIL, E.G. WHEN INSTITUTE STOCK SUBJECT COVERAGE IS MUCHWIDER THAN THAT OF THE CENTRAL LIBRARY, WHEN ACCESS TO THE UNION CATALOGUE ISEASY AND WHEN THE CATALOGUE CAN BE PRODUCED WITHOUT DETRIMENT TO OTHER WORK.
3876|COMPLETE CATALOGUE OF OLD PRINTED WORKS IN CYRILLIC AND GLAGOLITIC CHARACTERS'BASIC THEORY AND METHODOLOGY.     THERE HAS BEEN A GROWING DEMAND FOR A COMPLETE CATALOGUE OF CYRILLIC ANDGLAGOLITIC PRINTED WORKS OF THE 15|TH-17|TH CENTURIES.

3882|CLASSIFICATION OF HOMOSEXUALITY.     CRITICISES THE PLACING OF 'HOMOSEXUALITY' IN 2| CLASSIFICATION SYSTEMS, DEWEY(NORWEGIAN SUBJECT INDEX 1979|) AND ARNESEN, THE NORWEGIAN VERSION OF DEWEY(SUBJECT INDEX 1969|). BOTH MAKE THE UNTENABLE ASSUMPTION THAT HOMOSEXUALITY ISBY DEFINITION A SEXUAL DEVIATION. IN RECENT YEARS HOMOSEXUAL ORGANISATIONSHAVE WON SOME SYMPATHY FOR THEIR VIEW OF HOMOSEXUALITY AS A WAY OF LIFE ASVALID AS HETEROSEXUALITY, BUT THIS ASPECT IS NOT REPRESENTED IN THE TABLES.EVEN THE MOST NEUTRAL PLACING, 301|.45| MINORITIES, HAS OVERTONES OF INFERIORITYAND DISCRIMINATION.

3900|PIGGY IN THE MIDDLE: OBSERVATIONS ON THE ROLE OF THE INTERMEDIARY.     IT WAS CONFIDENTLY EXPECTED BY SYSTEM DESIGNERS THAT ON-LINE BIBLIOGRAPHICSEARCH SYSTEMS, WITH THEIR ABILITY TO PROVIDE DIRECT AND IMMEDIATE ACCESS TOINFORMATION, WOULD BE INTERROGATED BY THE END USER. A REVIEW OF THE LITERATUREREVEALS HOWEVER, THAT CONTRARY TO SUCH EXPECTATIONS, MOST SEARCHES ARE STILLBEING PERFORMED BY TRAINED INTERMEDIARIES. CLEARLY, THE ATTEMPT TO CONVERTFORMER OFF-LINE BATCH SYSTEMS USED BY EITHER COMPUTER SCIENTISTS ORINFORMATION SPECIALISTS, INTO ON-LINE INTERACTIVE SYSTEMS FOR USE BY ALL HASNOT WORKED, DESPITE THE CLAIMS OF THEIR DESIGNERS TO HAVING DEVELOPED 'USERFRIENDLY' SYSTEMS.
3901|AN EXPERT SYSTEM AS AN ONLINE SEARCH INTERMEDIARY.     EXAMINES THE APPLICATION OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TO ON-LINE SEARCH SYSTEMSBY THE DEVELOPMENT OF EXPERT SYSTEMS WHICH CAN BE INTERPOSED BETWEEN THE USERAND THE SEARCH SYSTEM. THE EXPERT SYSTEM WOULD SERVE AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO AHUMAN INTERMEDIARY.
3902|MY WISH IS YOUR COMMAND??.     THE INCREASING NUMBER OF DATA BASES AND DATA BANK SUPPLIERS HAS BROUGHT WITHIT THE PROBLEM THAT DIFFERENT HOST COMPUTERS MUST NORMALLY BE ACCESSED USINGDIFFERENT COMMAND LANGUAGES. MANY OF THESE LANGUAGES BEAR RELATIONSHIPS TO ONEANOTHER, BY VIRTUE OF COMMON ANCESTRY, COMMON DESIGN PHILOSOPHY, ETC. EVEN SO,THE SAME LANGUAGE CAN BE IMPLEMENTED DIFFERENTLY BY 2| SUPPLIERS. DIFFERENTIMPLEMENTATIONS AND/OR LANGUAGES MUST BE CONSIDERED BY ON-LINE USERS BEFORECONTRACTING WITH A HOST. THE CONSEQUENCES OF LEARNING A NEW COMMAND SET,BUYING ADDITIONAL MANUALS, AND ATTENDING EXTRA COURSES ARE ALL ECONOMIC ONES,AND ARE PARTICULARLY RELEVANT WHEN A DATA BASE IS OFFERED BY SEVERALSUPPLIERS.
3903|WHY STANDARDS FOR COMMAND LANGUAGES?.     THERE ARE MANY REASONS WHY THE GROWTH AND SPREAD IN THE USE OF ON-LINEINFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS HAS BEEN LESS DRAMATIC THAN MIGHT HAVE BEENEXPECTED. ONE OF THE OBSTACLES FACING THE USER IS THE NEED TO MASTER MANYDIVERSE USER INTERFACES. SEVERAL SOLUTIONS ARE OFFERED, YET, THE ONLY ONEWHICH IS REALLY OPEN AT PRESENT IS TO DECLINE TO USE ALL BUT 1| OR 2| FAMILIARSYSTEMS, ACCEPTING THAT SOME POTENTIALLY VALUABLE INFORMATION WILL BE MISSED.THE MAIN ALTERNATIVES SEEM TO BE THE ADOPTION OF STANDARDS BY SYSTEM OPERATORSOR THE USE OF TRANSLATING SOFTWARE SOMEWHERE BETWEEN THE USER AND THERETRIEVAL SYSTEMS. WITH THE ADVENT OF THE MICROPROCESSOR AND THE INTELLIGENTTERMINAL, THIS LATTER ALTERNATIVE BECOMES MORE ATTRACTIVE AND IT MAY APPEAR,AT 1|ST SIGHT, THAT THE NEED FOR STANDARDS FOR COMMAND LANGUAGES IS THEREFORELESSENED, OR EVEN DISAPPEARS TOTALLY. HOWEVER, CAREFUL CONSIDERATION OF THEPOSSIBILITIES OFFERED LEADS TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THE ADOPTI ON OF STANDARDSWILL BE MORE RATHER THAN LESS IMPORTANT IF MUCH OF THE POTENTIAL IS TO BEREALISED.

IN DUTCH SCHOOLS 2| METHODSOF LEARNING TO READ AND WRITE HAVE BEEN USED, THE TRADITIONAL METHOD OFLEARNING TO RECOGNISE LISTS OF SIMPLE BUT UNRELATED WORDS AND THE FUNCTIONALMETHOD WHICH WAS RELATED TO THE PUPIL'S ENVIRONMENT AND EXPERIENCE. WHICHEVERMETHOD IS USED, IT IS ESSENTIAL TO DEVELOP THE PUPIL'S ABILITY TO READFLUENTLY AND TO MOTIVATE HIM TO CONTINUE READING AFTER LEAVING SCHOOL. THEDUTCH PUBLIC LIBRARY ACT OF 1975| RECOGNISED THE IMPORTANCE OF LIBRARY SERVICESFOR YOUNG PEOPLE IN ABOLISHING LIBRARY MEMBERSHIP CHARGES UP TO THE AGE OF 18|.HOWEVER, THE ACT FAILED TO RECOGNISE THE NEED TO PROVIDE SPECIAL TYPES OFREADING MATERIALS FOR PEOPLE WITH READING DIFFICULTIES.

IT WAS ARGUED THATEXPANSION OF LIBRARY ACTIVITIES WAS NOT ENOUGH TO REACH THOSE UNFAMILIAR WITHLIBRARIES. THE INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK HAD PREVENTED GENUINE DECENTRALISATIONAND POPULARISATION OF CULTURE. LIBRARIES WITH RIGID MANAGEMENT AND DEMAND FORQUALIFIED STAFF WERE PREVENTING THEIR USE AS LOCAL CULTURE CENTRES. SOLUTIONSINVOLVING GREATER COORDINATION WITH OTHER LOCAL ACTIVITIES WERE OFFERED.AGAINST THIS MORTENSEN ARGUES THAT THE 1964| LIBRARY ACT PROMOTEDDECENTRALISATION AND THAT LIBRARIES MORE THAN OTHER INSTITUTIONS ARE REACHINGTHE BROAD POPULATION. WARNS AGAINST REDUCTION OF LIBRARY ACTIVITIES IN ORDERTO HELP THE GRASS ROOTS MOVEMENTS. LOCAL AUT HORITIES NEED THE SUPPORT OF THESTATE FOR LIBRARY SERVICES.

4159|LIBRARY USE AS A LEISURE ACTIVITY.     INTRODUCTORY SPEECH TO THE STUDY SESSION OF THE WORKING PARTY FOR COUNTYLIBRARY SYSTEMS, NOORDWIJKERHOUT, 1| SEPT 81|. IN THE NETHERLANDS, THE RISE INLIVING STANDARDS SINCE WORLD WAR II HAS OUTSTRIPPED THE INCREASE IN LEISURETIME. IN ADDITION THE AVERAGE CITIZEN DEVOTES A LARGE PROPORTION OF HISINCREASED PURCHASING POWER TO ACQUIRING PRIVATE COMFORTS. WHEREAS BEFORE THEWAR MOST PEOPLE VISITED THE CINEMA OR THEATRE FOR ENTERTAINMENT, AND TRAVELLEDBY BUS OR TRAIN, NOWADAYS THEY WATCH TELEVISION AT HOME AND TRAVEL BY PRIVATECAR. SIMILARLY RESEARCH SHOWS THAT THE AVERAGE CITIZEN USES THE LIBRARY NOT ASA SUBSTITUTE FOR A PRIVATE COLLECTION OF BOOKS BUT TO SUPPLEMENT HIS OWNCOLLECTION. AS THE ECONOMIC RECESSION DEEPENS THERE IS A REAL DANGER THAT THEGOVERNMENT WILL TURN PUBLIC LIBRARIES INTO RECREATIONAL CENTRES AND CREATE NEWLIBRARIES AS INFORMATION CENTRES.

4185|PUBLIC LIBRARY COOPERATION AND COOPERATIVES' A HISTORICAL OVERVIEW.     TRACES THE DEVELOPMENT OF US INTERLIBRARY COOPERATION DURING THE 20|TH CENTURY.UNSTRUCTURED COOPERATION, INDICATED BY SUCH ACTIVITIES AS THE NATIONAL UNIONCATALOG AT THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS (1901|) AND THE 1|ST INTERLIBRARY LOAN CODE(1917|), CONTINUES TODAY. SINCE WORLD WAR II, STRUCTURED COOPERATION, INCLUDINGREGIONAL NETWORKS, SPECIAL ACTIVITIES, AND MULTIPURPOSE COOPERATIVES, HASBECOME MORE PROMINENT. A DEFINITION OF LIBRARY COOPERATION IS OFFERED, ANDDIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE TERMS SYSTEM, NETWORK, AND CONSORTIUM ARE EXPLORED.PROBABLE FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS IN LIBRARY COOPERATION ARE MENTIONED, INCLUDINGAPPLICATIONS OF COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY AND POTENTIAL POLITICAL BENEFITS OFMULTITYPE LIBRARY COOPERATION.
4186|NETWORKING: AN EFFECTIVE RESPONSE TO CHANGE.     EDITED VERSION OF THE OPENING ADDRESS AT THE SEMINAR RESOURCE NETWORKING-ARESPONSE TO THE NEW TECHNOLOGY, ORGANISED BY THE LIBRARY BRANCH, EDUCATIONDEPARTMENT OF VICTORIA (AUSTRALIA), OCT 80|. DISCUSSES THE INTEREST IN RESOURCESHARING PROGRAMMES AND NETWORKS, TYPES OF COOPERATION IN THE EDUCATIONALENVIRONMENT, THE MEANING OF THE TERM 'LIBRARY NETWORK', AND FEATURES OF AWELL-DEVELOPED NETWORK.
4187|THE ENGINEERING SOCIETIES LIBRARY AND THE NEW YORK STATE INTERLIBRARY LOANPROGRAM' ONE SPECIAL LIBRARY'S EXPERIENCE IN A NETWORK.     DEALS WITH THE PRACTICES AND EXPERIENCES OF THE ENGINEERING SOCIETIES LIBRARYAS THEY PERTAIN TO ITS PARTICIPATION IN THE NEW YORK STATE INTERLIBRARY LOAN(NYSILL) PROGRAMME. A BRIEF GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THE LIBRARY WILL BEFOLLOWED BY A SHORT REVIEW OF THE NYSILL OPERATION AND THEN A STUDY OF THEDAILY OPERATIONS OF THE PROGRAMME AS THEY ARE HANDLED AT THE ENGINEERINGSOCIETIES LIBRARY.
4188|ASPECTS OF CO-OPERATION, FUNDING PRODUCTION, COPYRIGHT, TALENT-SHARING UNIONLISTS, INTERLENDING.     ARGUES THE CASE FOR COOPERATION BETWEEN PUBLIC LIBRARIES AND OTHERINSTITUTIONS SPECIFICALLY SERVING THE PRINT-HANDICAPPED. A SYSTEM FORPRODUCING AUDIO CASSETTES IS PROPOSED AS AN EXAMPLE, PRESUMING ONLY THEEXISTING RESOURCES AND FUNDING, WITHOUT RELYING ON GOVERNMENT GRANTS.
4189|COOPERATIVE PROGRAM FOR COLLECTING GOVERNMENT DOCUMENTS BETWEEN DEPOSITORY ANDNON-DEPOSITORY LIBRARIES.     NON-DEPOSITORY LIBRARIES CAN INCREASE THE NUMBER OF GOVERNMENT DOCUMENTSAVAILABLE WITHIN A REGION BY DEVELOPING COOPERATIVE STORAGE AND HANDLINGAGREEMENTS WITH AREA DEPOSITORY LIBRARIES. ALL CONDITIONS OF USE AND RETENTIONFOR DEPOSITORY MATERIALS APPLY, AND ACTUAL DOCUMENTS REMAIN THE RESPONSIBILITYOF THE DESIGNATED DEPOSITORY LIBRARY. THE DETAILS OF SUCH A COOPERATIVEPROGRAMME BETWEEN RENSSELAER POLYTECHNIC INSTITUTE AND TROY PUBLIC LIBRARY AREDESCRIBED.
4190|STANDARDS, SPECIFICATIONS, AND CODES' A UNION LIST APPROACH TO RESOURCESHARING IN THE CHICAGO METROPOLITAN AREA.     AS A RESULT OF MORE SOPHISTICATED TECHNOLOGY AND A GROWING CONSUMER PRESSUREFOR PRODUCT RELIABILITY, MANUFACTURERS, ENGINEERS, GOVERNMENTALREPRESENTATIVES, AND THE GENERAL PUBLIC ALIKE ARE REQUIRING IMPROVED ACCESS TOSTANDARDS AND SPECIFICATIONS. TRADITIONALLY, THIS INFORMATION RESOURCE HASBEEN DIFFICULT TO IDENTIFY, TO CONTROL, AND TO SERVICE. AS A RESPONSE TO THISPROBLEM, A SMALL TASK FORCE OF CHICAGO AREA TECHNICAL LIBRARIANS CONDUCTED ASURVEY OF AREA USERS TO ASCERTAIN WHAT STANDARDS COLLECTIONS WERE AVAILABLE,WHAT THE LEVEL OF NEED FOR STANDARDS MIGHT ACTUALLY BE, AND THE EXTENT TOWHICH EXISTING COLLECTIONS MIGHT BE SHARED AMONG USERS.
4191|TOWARDS LIBRARY UNIFICATION.     A TEXT PREPARED BY THE PUBLIC LIBRARIES SECTION OF THE ASSOCIATION DESBIBLIOTHECAIRES FRANCAIS (ABF) TO SUPPORT THE 1981| CONFERENCE MOTION ONLIBRARY UNIFICATION. A PRELIMINARY DISCUSSION BRIEFLY INTRODUCES THE ISSUESINVOLVED IN ESTABLISHING AN INTEGRATED NATIONAL NETWORK, IN THE FACE OF AGOVERNMENT POLICY OF DECENTRALISATION. THE ABF PROGRAMME FOR ACHIEVINGUNIFICATION IN SERVICE PROVISION, PERSONNEL ALLOCATION, AND PERSONNELTRAINING, IS THEN ELABORATED. IN EACH CASE DETAILS ARE GIVEN OF THE EXISTINGORGANISATION OF RESOURCES, THE ADVANTAGES OF UNIFICATION OUTLINED, AND THEMEANS OF IMPLEMENTING A POLICY OF INTEGRATION INDICATED.
4192|PRODUCTION AND CONSUMPTION OF INFORMATION IN THE UNIVERSITY.     ARGUES THAT THE INFORMATION SPECIALIST SHOULD, IN MEDIATING BETWEEN PRODUCERSAND CONSUMERS, EXERCISE DISCRIMINATION IN ASSESSING INFORMATION NEEDS ANDADOPT A QUALITATIVE RATHER THAN A QUANTITATIVE APPROACH. DISCUSSES THEQUANTITATIVE STUDIES OF INFORMATION PRODUCTION PUBLISHED OVER THE LAST 20|YEARS, AND PROPOSES AN ALTERNATIVE VIEWPOINT BASED ON BAUDRILLARD'SSOCIOLOGICAL ANALYSIS OF CONSUMPTION, EMPHASISING THE SOCIAL IMPLICATIONS OFCONSUMER DEMANDS. IF THE SOCIOLOGICAL PRESSURES BEHIND USER NEEDS AREUNDERSTOOD, THE INFORMATION SPECIALIST IS THEN ABLE TO BOTH MONITOR USERREQUIREMENTS AND EXERCISE SOME INFLUENCE OVER THE PRODUCTION OF INFORMATIONDESIGNED TO MEET SOCIAL PRESSURES RATHER THAN INTELLECTUAL OBJECTIVES.
4193|PUBLIC LIBRARIES AS A COMPULSORY PROVISION BY LOCAL AUTHORITIES.     AN INCREASING NUMBER OF PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT THE POSITION OF LOCAL AUTHORITYCULTURAL SERVICES MUST BE CLARIFIED IN THE 1980|S. THE LIBRARY SERVICE IS APART OF LOCAL CULTURE THAT CANNOT BE OVERLOOKED AND SO IT IS ESSENTIAL FOREACH LIBRARY TO COOPERATE WITH OTHER LIBRARIES, CULTURAL ORGANISATIONS ANDLOCAL GOVERNMENT ADMINISTRATORS. A DECISION IS NEEDED AS TO WHETHER LOCALAUTHORITIES ARE NOT ONLY ENTITLED BUT ALSO OBLIGED TO ADMINISTER PUBLICLIBRARIES. THE CONCEPT OF A NATIONAL LIBRARY LAW SHOULD BE RENOUNCED IN FAVOUROF A CONCEPT WHEREBY LOCAL AUTHORITIES IMPOSE ON THEMSELVES THE OBLIGATION TOPROVIDE PUBLIC LIBRARIES. LOCAL COMMUNITIES SHOULD DRAW UP THEIR OWN LIBRARYPLANS AND PROVIDE THE MONEY; EACH STATE SHOULD THEN PROVIDE FINANCIALASSISTANCE FOR LIBRARY WORK OUTSIDE THESE AREAS.
4194|THE LIBRARY BILL AND THE DANISH LIBRARY ASSOCIATION.     THE OFFICIAL STATEMENT OF THE DANISH LIBRARY ASSOCIATION ON THE MINISTRY OFCULTURE'S LIBRARY BILL OF 24| SEPT 81|. THE ASSOCIATION SUPPORTS THIS PROPOSAL,BUT WITH SOME RESERVATIONS. THUS IT SUPPORTS THE INCLUSION OF BOTH PUBLIC ANDRESEARCH LIBRARIES IN ONE ACT, BUT OPPOSES THE DECISION TO REMOVE SCHOOLLIBRARIES. IT SUPPORTS THE PROPOSED AMALGAMATION OF THE LIBRARY INSPECTORATEAND THE OFFICE OF NATIONAL LIBRARIAN, AND THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A LIBRARYCOUNCIL, ALBEIT WITH A DIFFERENT COMPOSITION. IT WOULD HAVE LIKED TO SEE ARTCOLLECTIONS PUT ON A PAR WITH MUSIC COLLECTIONS, AND LIBRARY PROVISION FORINTERMEDIATE EDUCATION AND OUTREACH ACTIVITIES MADE OBLIGATORY. THE LIBRARYCENTRE, OF WHOSE BOARD THE ASSOCIATION HAS A MAJORITY MEMBERSHIP, IS WILLINGTO COOPERATE IN DISCUSSIONS ON THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE NATIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHYAND URGES THAT ITS FINANCING BE CLARIFIED SOON. THE ASSOCIATION REGARDS THEAMOUNT SET ASIDE FOR TRANSITION OF P ART-TIME LIBRARIES TO FULL-TIME STATUSTOO LOW. IT SUPPORTS THE CHANGE TO BLOCK GRANT FINANCING.
4195|STATUTES AND THE PROVISION OF LIBRARY SERVICES FOR THE PRINT HANDICAPPED.     CONTRASTS THE EDUCATION ACT, 1958| (VICTORIA), WHICH ATTEMPTS TO FINANCEPROVISION FOR SERVICES FOR HANDICAPPED CHILDREN IN CONJUNCTION WITH THEIRNORMAL SCHOOLING WITH THE WESTERN AUSTRALIAN ACT WHICH STRESSES THE SEPARATEPROVISION FOR HANDICAPPED AND OTHER CHILDREN. METHODS OF INDIRECT REGULATIONIN THE FORM OF FUNDING WITH CONDITIONS ATTACHED ARE DISCUSSED AS IS THE CHOICEAMONG FUNDING POSSIBILITIES. NOTES CONSTITUTIONAL PROBLEMS RELATED TO THEESTABLISHMENT OF A NATIONAL SCHEME FOR LIBRARY SERVICES FOR THE HANDICAPPED.
4196|SELF-EVALUATION GUIDELINES FOR SPECIAL LIBRARIES' A REVIEW OF POSSIBILITIES.     PROJECT FINANCED BY THE BRITISH LIBRARY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT.THE COLLECTION AND COLLATION OF VIEWS ON REQUIREMENTS FOR A SELF-EVALUATIONMETHODS PACKAGE FOR SPECIAL LIBRARIES WAS FOLLOWED BY THE DESIGNING, TESTINGAND EVALUATION OF POSSIBLE TOOLS.
4197|LIBRARY STATISTICS-PROOF OF EXECUTED WORK OR A STEERING AID TOWARDS INCREASEDEFFECTIVENESS?.     THE IMPORTANCE OF STATISTICAL INFORMATION AS A MEANS FOR LIBRARY MANAGEMENTAND PLANNING IS STRESSED. TO ATTAIN A BETTER PERFORMANCE MEASURING OF ROUTINESERVICE OPERATIONS IS NOT ENOUGH BUT ALSO HAVE TO INCLUDE USER PERFORMANCE INORDER TO PROMOTE A BETTER UTILISATION OF LIBRARY RESOURCES.

A GLOSSARYOF TERMS IS PROVIDED AS A GUIDE TO DATA ELEMENTS WHICH ARE USED FOR RECORDING,REPORTING AND EXCHANGING DATA ABOUT LIBRARY RESOURCES AND LIBRARY PROGRAMMES.
4201|LIBRARY RESOURCE ALLOCATION.     METHODOLOGICAL ATTEMPT TO ANALYSE AND FIND SOLUTIONS TO THE COMPLICATEDPROBLEMS OF PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT IN ACADEMIC LIBRARIES. THE FOCUS OF THESTUDY IS ON RECENTLY ESTABLISHED LIBRARIES, ESPECIALLY IN DEVELOPINGCOUNTRIES. SPECIFIC FINDINGS OF STUDIES CONDUCTED RECENTLY AT AN INDIANUNIVERSITY ARE ALSO PRESENTED.
4202|THE TEC REPORT FOR THE 1982|-84| TRIENNIUM.     DISCUSSES THE AUSTRALIAN TERTIARY EDUCATION COUNCIL'S REPORT 1982|-84| AS ITAFFECTS THE FINANCE AND SERVICES OF COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES.CONCLUDES THAT LIBRARY FUNDING DURING THIS PERIOD WILL DECLINE UNLESSINDIVIDUAL INSTITUTIONS PRESERVE THEIR LIBRARIES AT THE EXPENSE OF OTHERAREAS.
4203|LEVELS OF OUTPUT RELATED TO COST OF OPERATION OF SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICALLIBRARIES. PART 1|' TECHNIQUES AND CUMULATIVE STATISTICS.     THE LORCOST PROJECT WAS UNDERTAKEN TO DEVELOP A QUANTITATIVE PICTURE OF COSTSAND SERVICES AT SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL LIBRARIES IN THE USA BY THECONSTRUCTION OF A MATHEMATICAL MODEL.
4204|LEVELS OF OUTPUT RELATED TO COST OF OPERATION OF SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICALLIBRARIES: PART 2|. A CAPACITY MODEL OF THE AVERAGE COST FORMULA.     AN ECONOMETRIC ANALYSIS HAS BEEN MADE OF COST AND SERVICE DATA REPRESENTING 65|SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL LIBRARIES. THE DATA INCLUDE LIBRARIES IN A VARIETY OFINSTITUTIONAL ENVIRONMENTS, RANGING IN OPERATING BUDGET FROM $20|,000| TO$2|,000|,000| PER YEAR. ALL THE DATA ARE WELL DESCRIBED BY A SINGLE FORMULA,WHICH EXHIBITS ECONOMIES OF SCALE, AND FIXED RELATIVE UNIT COST OF THE VARIOUSDIMENSIONS OF SERVICE. (FOR PART 1| SEE PREVIOUS ABSTRACT).
4205|ECONOMIES THAT AFFECT THE HEART OF THE SERVICE' A 2|BUCH UND BIBLIOTHEK1|DISCUSSION ON ASSISTED LIBRARY BUDGETS.     REPORT OF DISCUSSION BETWEEN FRIEDRICH ANDRAE, KLAUS HOHLFELD, ULRICH THIEM,HANS JOACHIM VOGT AND 2|BUCH UND BIBLIOTHEK1| HELD AT THE GERMAN LIBRARYASSOCIATION'S ANNUAL CONFERENCE IN BREMEN, NOV 81|. IT IS A LIBRARIAN'S JOB TOPROMOTE THE USE OF BOOKS, A JOB WHICH MUST BE TAKEN MORE SERIOUSLY THAN EVERBEFORE. RECENT SURVEYS HAVE SHOWN THAT ABOUT 40|% OF THE POPULATION ARE LIBRARYUSERS. WHERE POSSIBLE, ECONOMIES SHOULD BE MADE IN WORKING METHODS RATHER THANIN SERVICES; THIS DEMANDS MORE CENTRALISATION. IT IS BETTER TO PUT BOOKS INLAUNDRY BASKETS ON WINDOW LEDGES AND ON PAVEMENTS THAN TO TAKE THEM AWAY FROMTHE PUBLIC COMPLETELY OR TO MAKE THEM AVAILABLE ONLY FOR RESTRICTED PERIODS.LIBRARIES MAKE A VALUABLE CONTRIBUTION TOWARDS THE MASTERY OF LIFE'S PROBLEMS,AN ARGUMENT WHICH POLITICIANS AND ADMINISTRATORS ARE BEGINNING TO APPRECIATE.
4206|THE WILL TO SURVIVE.     DISCUSSES THE CUTBACKS IN SERVICES TO CHILDREN IN THE USA THROUGH PUBLIC ANDSCHOOL LIBRARIES AND PROBLEMS OF ACCESS TO RESOURCES. TURNING POINTS IN PUBLICLIBRARY SERVICE TO CHILDREN SEEM TO REVOLVE AROUND 3| FACTORS' USE OF THEGENERALIST APPROACH IN PROVIDING SERVICE; THE CHANGING STATUS OF THE CENTRALCHILDREN'S LIBRARY; AND DEVELOPING SCHOOL/PUBLIC LIBRARY COOPERATION.CHILDREN'S LIBRARIANS MUST EXERT PRESSURE FOR EXAMINATION OF LIBRARY SCHOOLCURRICULA AND RECOMMENDED PROGRAMMES THAT PREPARE CHILDREN'S LIBRARYSPECIALISTS.
4207|IT IS USELESS TO ECONOMISE WHEN MONEY IS IN SHORT SUPPLY.     THE GERMAN ECONOMY IS ADAPTING WITH DIFFICULTY TO THE RECESSION, TO THEDETRIMENT OF PUBLIC BUDGETS. CULTURE IS IMPORTANT DURING ECONOMIC CRISES,THEREFORE CULTURAL BODIES CANNOT RENEGE ON THEIR SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITIES.THRIFT MAY NOT ALWAYS BE THE MOST ECONOMIC PROCEDURE. AN ANALYSIS IS MADE OFSTATISTICS ON LIBRARY EXPENDITURE BY LARGE AND SMALL LOCAL AUTHORITIES IN WESTGERMANY IN 1975|-79| TO ILLUSTRATE THE IMPORTANCE OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEENSTAFFING COSTS AND THE TOTAL BUDGET. A CAREFUL LIBRARY POLICY MUST RECOGNISETHE POSSIBILITIES AND LIMITATIONS OF ADAPTING TO THE FINANCIAL SITUATION INTHE LIGHT OF ITS SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITIES. IF RATIONALISATION METHODS ARECARRIED OUT EFFICIENTLY, THE LIBRARY SERVICE CAN ADAPT IN THE RIGHT WAY.
4208|ONLINE IN SAUDI ARABIA.     FACTORS INHIBITING THE USE OF COMPUTERS IN SAUDI LIBRARIES ARE OUTLINED. THERECENT TREND TOWARDS A GROWTH IN THE USE OF COMPUTERS, IN SPITE OFDIFFICULTIES, IS NOTED IN THE LIGHT OF LABOUR SHORTAGES AND STAFFING PROBLEMS.USE OF COMPUTERS IS SEEN AS ONE WAY TO IMPROVE LIBRARY SERVICES WITHOUTEXPANDING STAFF.
4209|MICROCOMPUTER APPLICATIONS IN ARCHIVES' A STUDY IN PROGRESS.     STATE OF THE ART REPORT ON THE USE OF MICROCOMPUTERS IN ARCHIVAL WORK IN THEUSA AND CANADA. INCREASINGLY, THE COMPUTER IS USED AS AN ADMINISTRATIVE TOOLAND AS AN ASSISTANT IN THE MANAGEMENT OF INFORMATION.

4212|AN INFORMAL SURVEY OF OPERATIONAL MICROPROCESSOR-BASED SYSTEMS, AUTUMN, 1979|.     TRADITIONALLY COMPUTER APPLICATIONS IN LIBRARIES HAVE BEEN LIMITED, BOTH INSCALE AND TYPE, BY THE RELATIVELY HIGH PRICE OF CONVENTIONAL COMPUTEREQUIPMENT. ADVANCES IN MICROELECTRONICS TECHNOLOGY, AND ESPECIALLYMICROPROCESSOR-BASED MACHINES, SUCH AS MICROCOMPUTERS AND WORD PROCESSORS,HAVE THE POTENTIAL FOR RADICALLY ALTERING THIS SITUATION. REPORTS ON A SURVEYUNDERTAKEN BY ASLIB TO SEE HOW FAR THIS TECHNOLOGY HAS PENETRATED THE LIBRARYAND INFORMATION WORLD. SYSTEMS IN THE VARIOUS ORGANISATIONS VISITED AREDESCRIBED, AS WELL AS THE APPLICATIONS FOR WHICH THEY ARE UTILISED.

A TALK GIVEN TO THE ASSOCIATION OF PART-TIME LIBRARIANS, GROUP C OF THE DANISHLIBRARY ASSOCIATION, AT ITS 25| YEARS' JUBILEE, OCT 81|, BY A FORMER CHAIRMAN.WHEN THE ASSOCIATION WAS FORMED IN 1956|, AS AN ASSOCIATION OF PARISHLIBRARIANS, THE POSITION AS PART-TIME LIBRARIAN WAS USUALLY HONORARY ANDUNPAID, A FACT WHICH CAUSED LACK OF ESTEEM FOR THE JOB. THERE WAS LITTLEINTEREST IN MEMBERSHIP AND THE ASSOCIATION HAD TO BE FINANCIALLY SUPPORTED BYTHE GROUP OF PARISH LIBRARY COMMITTEES, THE MEMBERS' EMPLOYERS. HOSTILITY HASBEEN MET FROM THE LIBRARIANS' ASSOCIATION AND LATER THE LIBRARIANS' UNION,UNNECESSARILY, AS THE PART-TIME LIBRARIANS ON THE WHOLE RECOGNISE THE ULTIMATEGOAL OF FULL-TIME LIBRARIES STAFFED BY PROFESSIONAL LIBRARIANS, BUT INSIST ONSATISFACTORY TRANSITIONAL ARRANGEMENTS. THERE SHOULD BE A CHANCE FOR PART-TIMELIBRARIANS THROUGH SUPPLEMENTARY COURSES TO QUALIFY AS LIBRARIANS, AND IT ISPOSSIBLE FOR THE PROFESSIONALS AND THE NON-PROFESS IONALS TO WORK SIDE BY SIDE.

THE AVAILABLE TRAINING COURSES ARE OUTLINED, AND THE DISTINCTIONSBETWEEN TECHNICIANS AND LIBRARIANS IN THEORY AND IN PRACTICE, WITH REFERENCETO TRAINING, RESPONSIBILITIES AND STATUS, DEFINED. THE TECHNICIAN'S MAINPROBLEMS, LACK OF RECOGNITION BY EMPLOYERS AND OPPOSITION FROM OTHERCATEGORIES OF STAFF, ARE CONSIDERED, AND IN CONCLUSION, PREDICTS THAT THEPRESENT DRAWBACKS WILL DIMINISH AS THE USE OF LIBRARY TECHNOLOGY INCREASES.
4224|THE PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT AND COMMUNICATION.     THE INTER-RELATIONSHIP OF ALL ELEMENTS DETECTABLE BY THE SENSES IS IMPORTANTTO THE DESIGN OF SPACES FOR USE BY THE HANDICAPPED. OFFERS EXAMPLES EMBODYINGTHIS PRINCIPLE. QUESTIONS THE ASSUMPTION OF DIFFICULTY IN DESIGNING FOR THEDISABLED PARTICULARLY IN VIEW OF THE DEMANDS MADE BY THE PLACE IN SOCIETY OFMOTOR VEHICLES. MENTIONS ALSO THE OUTWARD APPEARANCE OF BUILDINGS WHICH MAY BEINVITING OR DISCOURAGING.
4225|STANDARDS FOR LIBRARY BUILDING.     THE IMPORTANCE OF STANDARDS IN THE PLANNING AND RUNNING OF ALL TYPES OFLIBRARY ARE STRESSED. THE EFFECT OF TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENTS, SUCH ASCOMPUTERISED CATALOGUING, CIRCULATION CONTROL AND COOPERATIVE ACQUISITIONCOUPLED WITH TELECOMMUNICATIONS ON LIBRARY STANDARDS ARE CONSIDERED ALONG WITHTHE NEED TO DESIGN FOR HANDICAPPED LIBRARY USERS.
4226|LIBRARY BUILDING IN AUSTRIA.     AFTER A HISTORICAL OUTLINE ON LIBRARIES IN AUSTRIA, STARTING WITH THE MEDIEVALLIBRARIES OF THE MONASTERIES, EMPHASIS IS LAID ON THE BUILDINGS AND PLANNINGSINCE WORLD WAR II. IT IS SHOWN THAT IN RECENT YEARS 15|,000| SQ.M. WERE MADEAVAILABLE WHILE MORE THAN 30|,000| SQ.M. ARE UNDER CONSTRUCTION AND 45|,000| SQ.M.ARE IN THE PLANNING STAGE.
4227|THE ARCHITECT'S VIEW OF MULTI-PURPOSE PLANS.     USING LIBRARIES AND SCHOOLS FOR OTHER PURPOSES OUTSIDE OPENING HOURS IS ANATURAL AND GOOD CONSEQUENCE OF THEIR DEVELOPING LIAISON WITH OTHER CULTURALACTIVITIES. THE TRADITION OF CHARGING AT MOST A NOMINAL RENT IS LESSDEFENSIBLE. EXTRA USE INVOLVES UPKEEP AND STAFFING COSTS, AND ORGANISATIONSMAY RENT UNSUITABLE PREMISES FOR FINANCIAL REASONS. THE DISTRICT CENTRE ATLYNGEN, NORWAY, HOUSING A WIDE RANGE OF ORGANISATIONS AND A POTENTIAL EXAMPLEOF INTEGRATED ACTIVITY, HAS TO CHARGE A RENT UNACCEPTABLE TO SMALLER GROUPS.FOR EFFECTIVE USE, ALL CULTURAL PREMISES SHOULD HAVE THE SAME FINANCIALSTANDING AND JOINT ADMINISTRATION. IN PLANNING OR CONVERSION, THE NEEDS OFINDIVIDUAL USERS SHOULD BE ANALYSED AND COORDINATED. THE LIBRARIAN, FORINSTANCE, SHOULD BE ABLE TO RENT CERTAIN AREAS FULL-TIME (E.G. THE NECESSARYSPACE FOR STORING EQUIPMENT, SHELVING AND BOOKS) AND OTHER AREAS FOR THELIBRARY'S ACTUAL OPENING HOURS, OUTSIDE WHICH THEY COULD BE USED  BY OTHERORGANISATIONS.
4228|ALESUND LIBRARY ON THE TOWN'S MOST CENTRAL SITE.     ALESUND CENTRAL LIBRARY, NORWAY, OPENED IN SEPT 80| AS PART OF A MAJORADMINISTRATIVE BUILDING.

UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES AND UNIVERSITIES ARE FACED WITH THE PROBLEM OF HOW TOMAKE ACADEMIC UNIVERSITY WORK CLEAR AND INTELLIGIBLE TO THE OUTSIDER. 1| WAY ISTHROUGH WELL-ORGANISED PUBLIC EXHIBITIONS IN UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES. ANEXHIBITION WHICH WAS ORGANISED BY STUDENTS OF THE HISTORY OF ART DEPARTMENT ATFREIBERG UNIVERSITY IN JUNE/JULY 80| WAS AN EXCELLENT EXAMPLE OF THIS TYPE OFACTIVITY. THE STUDENTS ARRANGED CONTACT WITH THE MEDIA, THE ACTUAL EXHIBITIONOBJECTS, CONTACT WITH THE ARTISTS, PUBLICITY, AN OPENING AT WHICH THE ARTISTSWERE PRESENT, GUIDES TO THE EXHIBITION, WORKSHOPS, TALKS AND PUBLICDISCUSSIONS. ALL THE LIBRARY HAD TO DO WAS PROVIDE THE EXHIBITION ROOMS.

4237|RESEARCH ENHANCEMENT BY HEURISTIC INFORMATION.     AFTER A REVIEW OF HEURISTICS AND HEURISTIC INFORMATION SOME ASPECTS OF MISSIONORIENTED INFORMATION ARE DEALT WITH FROM THE LIBRARIAN'S VIEWPOINT.INFORMATION STAFF SHOULD BE AWARE THAT RELEVANT INFORMATION MAY BE LOCATED BYSEARCHING FIELDS OTHER THAN THE USER'S SPECIALITY. IN ADDITION TO THETRADITIONAL SOURCES, AN INTERDISCIPLINARY APPROACH ASSISTS IN THE EXPLOITATIONOF SUCH MATERIALS AS REPORTS IN METHODOLOGICAL SURVEYS, RESEARCH REPORTS ANDDISSERTATIONS. SOCIOLOGICAL INFORMATION CAN BE OF HEURISTIC VALUE INEPIDEMIOLOGICAL RESEARCH. HOWEVER, HEURISTIC INFORMATION WILL BE SERVICEABLEONLY IF THE LIBRARIAN IS FAMILIAR WITH THE SCIENTIST'S AIMS AND FIELD OFRESEARCH.
4238|INFORMATION SYSTEMS FOR NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT-THE SOCIAL RELEVANCE OFINFORMATION SYSTEMS.     EXTRACT FROM THE 6|TH GABRIEL A. BERNADO MEMORIAL LECTURE, UNIVERSITY OF THEPHILIPPINES, MAR 79|. CONSIDERS THE ROLE PLAYED BY INFORMATION SYSTEMS OF ALLTYPES IN REACHING NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT GOALS, PARTICULARLY IN DEVELOPINGCOUNTRIES. DEVOTES SPECIAL ATTENTION TO PROBLEMS IN BUILDING THE INFORMATIONINFRASTRUCTURE AND INFORMATION POLICY-MAKING IN A CONSTANTLY CHANGING SOCIETY,TAKING INTO ACCOUNT ECONOMIC, SOCIAL AND POLITICAL FACTORS. THE USE OFINFORMATION IN RURAL DEVELOPMENT IS TREATED IN DETAIL AS AN EXAMPLE.

PRELIMINARY DETAILS ARE GIVEN OF THE POLITICAL AND ECONOMICSITUATION OF THE IVORY COAST, THE MOST DEVELOPED OF THE FORMER AFRICANCOLONIES. A DETAILED INVESTIGATION OF INFORMATION SERVICES WAS EFFECTED TOESTABLISH WHETHER INFORMATION PROVISION PRODUCED DEVELOPMENT, OR RESULTED FROMIT. DETAILS ARE GIVEN OF RESOURCES AND SERVICES, NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONALNETWORK LINKS, EXPENDITURE, AND GOVERNMENT INFORMATION POLICY. FORMAL ANDINFORMAL COMMUNICATION CHANNELS ARE ANALYSED WITH PARTICULAR REFERENCE TO THENATIONAL LIBRARY AND NATIONAL ARCHIVES, WHERE THE EXCELLENCE OF THECOLLECTIONS IS NOT FULLY EXPLOITED BECAUSE OF INADEQUATE RESOURCES, ASCOMPARED TO THE ELECTRICAL ENERGY INFORMATION CENTRE, WHICH IS FINANCIALLYWELL SUPPORTED. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE POLICY INCLUDE COOPERATION WITHOTHER AFRICAN STATES, THE ELABORATION OF A COHERENT NATIONAL INFORMATIONPOLICY, THE IMP OSITION OF CHARGES FOR INFORMATION SERVICES, AND THEDEVELOPMENT OF TRAINING PROGRAMMES IN INFORMATION USE.

EXAMINES THE TYPES OF MACHINE AID WHICH ARE SUITABLE FOR USE IN ALARGE TRANSLATING OPERATION SUCH AS THOSE MET IN THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITYINSTITUTIONS. REVIEWS THE WAY IN WHICH THESE MACHINE AIDS ARE ALREADY BEINGUSED IN LARGE ORGANISATIONS AND EXAMINES THE AREAS IN WHICH THEY CAN BE OFBENEFIT TO THE RUNNING OF THE WHOLE ORGANISATION. WARNS OF POSSIBLEDIFFICULTIES IN INTRODUCING THEM. IF THESE DIFFICULTIES CAN BE OVERCOME, MANYADVANTAGES CAN BE GAINED IN A LARGE ORGANISATION BY INTRODUCING AFULLY-INTEGRATED WORD-PROCESSING SYSTEM IN WHICH ALL TEXTS ARE STORED INELECTRONIC ARCHIVES AND CAN BE TRANSMITTED ELECTRONICALLY FROM 1| WORK STATIONTO ANOTHER, AND FROM 1| COUNTRY TO ANOTHER.
4299|MACHINE AIDS' A SMALL USER'S REACTION.     PAPER PRESENTED AT THE ASLIB TECHNICAL TRANSLATION GROUP CONFERENCE, LONDON,20| NOV 80|.

STANDARDISATION WITHIN THE LIBRARY AND INFORMATION COMMUNITY IS DEFINED ANDTHEN CONSIDERED IN TERMS OF SUPPORT FROM AND INVOLVEMENT OF THE COMMUNITY,FACTORS CAUSING STANDARDISATION, AND PROBLEMS ENCOUNTERED IN THE DEVELOPMENTOF STANDARDS. CONCLUDES THAT THERE IS A VIABLE MECHANISM FOR THE DEVELOPMENTOF BIBLIOGRAPHIC STANDARDS, BUT THAT THERE IS LACKING NOT ONLY A BASICUNDERSTANDING OF THIS MECHANISM AND THE IMPORTANCE OF STANDARDS BY THEINFORMATION COMMUNITY, BUT ALSO THE NECESSARY COMMITMENT AND INVOLVEMENTCRITICAL TO SUCCESSFUL STANDARDISATION.
4304|THE USBC AND CONTROL OF THE BIBLIOGRAPHIC DATABASE.     A NUMBER OF PROBLEMS HAVE ARISEN BY THE USE OF ISBN FOR COMPUTERISEDBIBLIOGRAPHIC RECORDS. THE NEED FOR A CONTROL NUMBER THAT IS NOT SUBJECT TOMISAPPLICATION EITHER BY HUMAN ERROR OR THROUGH FAULTS IN ITS STRUCTURE HASLED TO THE CONCEPT OF THE UNIVERSAL STANDARD BOOK CODE (USBC). THE STRUCTUREAND FUNCTION OF USBC IS DESCRIBED BRIEFLY AND THE ABILITY OF USBC TO DETECTDUPLICATES IN DATA BASES IS HIGHLIGHTED.
4305|OCLC-MARC TAPES AND COLLECTION MANAGEMENT.     OCLC-MARC SUBSCRIPTION SERVICE TAPES CAN BE USED AS A CONVENIENT SOURCE OFSTATISTICAL DATA FOR COLLECTION MANAGEMENT. NEW ACQUISITIONS CAN BE ANALYSEDBY USING MONTHLY AND ANNUAL CUMULATIVE TAPES. INFORMATION OBTAINABLE INCLUDESGENERAL STATISTICS SUCH AS NUMBERS OF NEW TITLES ADDED BY SUBJECTS, TYPES OFMATERIALS, LANGUAGES OF THE TEXT, AND INTELLECTUAL LEVELS. USING BOOLEANOPERATORS, IT IS POSSIBLE TO GENERATE STATISTICS SUCH AS THE NUMBER OFCHEMISTRY HANDBOOKS PUBLISHED AFTER 1970|, ART HISTORY BOOKS WRITTEN IN THESPANISH LANGUAGE FILMSTRIPS TREATING AMERICAN HISTORY SUITED FOR CHILDREN,ETC.
4306|CENTRAL STOCK ACQUISITION FOR PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN 1982|.     THIS PRACTICE, CARRIED OUT BY THE CZECH MINISTRY OF CULTURE AND NOW WELLESTABLISHED, DOES NOT REPLACE PUBLIC LIBRARIES STOCK ACQUISITION, BUT ISINTENDED TO HELP IN THOSE FIELDS WHERE THE LIBRARIES ARE TO BE INSTRUMENTAL INREALISATION OF THE STATE CULTURAL POLICY. THE FUNDS ARE NOT SMALL; THE SUMINVOLVED IS MORE THAN 3| MILLION CROWNS. THE SELECTION OF TITLES AND READERSSERVICES CONCERNING THIS LITERATURE ARE EXPLAINED.
4307|USE OF A CATALOGING CENTER'S BIBLIOGRAPHIC RECORDS AS A MEANS TO CHECK ANDBALANCE ACQUISITIONS ACTIVITIES AT AN ACADEMIC HEALTH SCIENCES LIBRARY.     THE ACQUISITIONS STAFF AT WAYNE STATE UNIVERSITY'S SHIFFMAN MEDICAL LIBRARYHAS DEVELOPED A VALIDATION SYSTEM BASED ON THE REQUESTS FOR CATALOGUING FROMTHE 5| TEACHING HOSPITALS WHICH ARE MEMBERS OF THE DETROIT COOPERATIVECATALOGING CENTER (DC3|). DC3| PROVIDES DATA ON MEMBERS' ACQUISITION ACTIVITESWHICH HAVE ASSISTED IN POINTING UP DEFICIENCIES IN SHIFFMAN'S BOOK BUDGET, ANDIN ASSESSING THE ADEQUACY OF SELECTIVE PURCHASING IN THE FACE OF FISCALCONSTRAINTS. THIS SYSTEM IS BEING USED TO GENERATE THE KIND OF INFORMATIONNEEDED BY BOTH ACQUISITIONS LIBRARIANS AND LIBRARY ADMINISTRATORS IN ORDER TOMAKE INFORMED COLLECTION DEVELOPMENT DECISIONS.

ANALYSES COLLECTION-DEVELOPMENT POLICIES AND PRACTICES IN 7| US ACADEMICLIBRARIES, DRAWING ON 2| THEORETICAL PERSPECTIVES-ANALYSES OF THE STRUCTURE ANDFUNCTION OF COMPLEX ORGANISATIONS AND ANALYSES OF RESOURCE ALLOCATION. 340|ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS, FACULTY MEMBERS, AND COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITYADMINISTRATORS WERE INTERVIEWED, FIELD OBSERVATIONS WERE MADE, AND MATERIALWAS COLLECTED FROM STATISTICAL SUMMARIES AND REPORTS. THIS WORK IS INTENDED TOMAKE A BASIC CONTRIBUTION TO THE SOCIAL SCIENCE STUDY OF COMPLEXORGANISATIONS.
4310|MEETING THE INFORMATION NEEDS OF THE PRINT HANDICAPPED-MORE THAN RAMPS ANDSLIDING DOORS.     PRESENTS THE VIEW THAT THE INFORMATION NEEDS OF THE HANDICAPPED ARE EQUAL INSCOPE TO THOSE OF OTHER PEOPLE AND THAT LIBRARIANS SHOULD DEVELOP COLLECTIONSIN THE FORMATS NECESSARY TO MEET THOSE NEEDS. FOCUSES ON THE BASIC COMPONENTSNECESSARY TO BUILDING AND ORGANISING COLLECTIONS AS WELL AS THE LIMITATIONS TOBE ENCOUNTERED.
4311|THE AMERICAN TRUST FOR THE BRITISH LIBRARY.     THE AIMS OF THE AMERICAN TRUST FOR THE BRITISH LIBRARY WERE ORIGINALLY TOENABLE THE BL TO AUGMENT ITS HOLDINGS OF AMERICAN PUBLICATIONS FROM THE 1880|STO THE 1950|S AND TO REPLACE BOOKS STILL MISSING FROM WORLD WAR 2| LOSSES. THEROLE OF ATBL IN THE PROMOTION OF AMERICAN STUDIES IN THE UK IS DISCUSSED.
4312|EFFECT OF ONLINE SERVICES ON PURCHASE OF A PRINTED INDEX.     REVIEWS THE TREND OF PURCHASING OF A PRINTED INDEX (2|INDEX MEDICUS1|) WITHINTHE SOUTH WEST THAMES REGIONAL HEALTH AUTHORITY (UK). SHOWS THAT AS THEMACHINE READABLE COUNTERPART (MEDLINE) HAS BECOME MORE EASILY ACCESSIBLE THEPURCHASE AND USE OF 2|INDEX MEDICUS1| HAS INCREASED RATHER THAN DIMINISHED.
4313|REQUIREMENTS FOR ESTABLISHING A REGIONAL INFORMATION NUCLEUS IN NORTH EASTBRAZIL.     TO DEMONSTRATE THE PROBLEMS OF ESTABLISHING A REGIONAL INFORMATION NETWORK,THE EXISTING INFORMATION RESOURCES IN BRAZIL'S NORTHEAST WERE INVESTIGATED.DATA OBTAINED FROM THE 2|BRAZILIAN STATISTICAL ANNUAL1| AND THE BRAZILIAN2|NATIONAL UNION CATALOGUE OF PERIODICALS1| SHOWED THAT COMPARED TO OTHERREGIONS, ALTHOUGH RELATIVELY WELL ENDOWED WITH LIBRARIES, THE NORTHEAST ISINADEQUATELY SUPPLIED WITH PERIODICALS, AND THAT THE MAJORITY OF COLLECTIONSARE INCOMPLETE OR DUPLICATED. A PLANNED ACQUISITION PROGRAMME FOR SERIALS,BACKED BY AN ORGANISED INTERLIBRARY LOAN POLICY, IS RECOMMENDED, TOGETHER WITHINVESTIGATIONS TO ESTABLISH USER NEEDS AND PERIODICAL USAGE, AS ESSENTIALPRELIMINARIES FOR NETWORK PLANNING.
4314|USE FOR ELECTRONIC MAIL FOR ILL.     THE USE OF ELECTRONIC MAIL BY THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST BIBLIOGRAPHIC CENTER TOTRANSMIT INTERLIBRARY LOAN REQUESTS TO AND FROM MEMBER LIBRARIES IS DESCRIBED.
4315|ON THE INTERLIBRARY LOAN MAP.     IN QUESTIONNAIRE REPLIES, FEW READERS AT THE OPOCHKA REGIONAL LIBRARY KNEW OFTHE INTERLIBRARY LOANS SYSTEM, (ILS). THE REGIONAL LIBRARY'S DEPARTMENT OFAGRICULTURAL LITERATURE BIBLIOGRAPHERS PRODUCE INFORMATION LISTS ON NEWACCESSIONS, SO THE REASON CANNOT BE LACK OF INFORMATION ON AGRICULTURALPUBLICATIONS. INDIVIDUAL WORK WITH READERS IS NECESSARY TO DISCOVER THEIR TRUEREQUIREMENTS. UNFORTUNATELY SOME LIBRARIES CONSIDER THE ILS AN OPTIONALBURDEN. UNDER ILS RULES FICTION AND EDUCATIONAL BOOKS ARE DISPATCHED ONLY FORSCIENTIFIC AND PRODUCTIVE WORK. PROBLEMS ARISE IN DEFINING 'EDUCATIONAL'BOOKS. FROM JULY 81| A STATE STANDARD WILL APPEAR CONCERNING A UNIFIED ILS ANDINTRODUCING CERTAIN CHANGES.
4316|THE IMPACT OF THE OCLC INTERLIBRARY SUBSYSTEM ON A SCIENCE ORIENTED ACADEMICLIBRARY.     ANALYSIS AND STATISTICS ARE PRESENTED FOR 1| YEAR OF THE CALIFORNIA INSTITUTEOF TECHNOLOGY LIBRARY'S USE OF OCLC AS A BORROWER, AS WELL AS A LENDER. THEKNOWLEDGE OF LOCATION OF ITEMS IN A WIDE RANGE OF LIBRARIES HAS MADE INTERLOANREQUEST COMMUNICATIONS FOR BOOKS EASIER, QUICKER, AND MORE PRECISE. REQUESTSBY CALTECH FOR JOURNAL ARTICLES, REPORTS, ETC. ARE NOT HANDLED VIA OCLC.REQUESTS RECEIVED FROM OTHER LIBRARIES SHOW SOME LACK OF DISCRIMINATION BYSPECIFYING ITEMS NOT SHOWN AS AT CALTECH OR BY ASKING FOR RECENTLY PUBLISHEDBOOKS. HOWEVER, THE VOLUME OF SUCH REQUESTS IS SMALL.
4317|AUTOMATED INTERLIBRARY LOANS.     BEN AN SSSR, (USSR ACADEMY OF SCIENCES NATURAL SCIENCES LIBRARY), (ASNS), USESFOR INTERLIBRARY LOANS THE NATURAL SCIENCES STOCK OF 50| MOSCOW LEARNEDLIBRARIES; THIS NECESSITATED AN AUTOMATED PROCESS. ASNS HAS AUTOMATED ITSSERVICE CONTROLLING THE FLOW OF REQUESTS, THEIR PROCESSING, AND OVERDUES. ACOMPUTER PROVIDES INFORMATION ON THE PROGRESS OF LOAN REQUESTS AND STATISTICALDATA ON INTERLIBRARY LOANS. A SPECIAL TRIPLICATE ORDER FORM PERMITS THEINTRODUCTION OF INFORMATION INTO THE COMPUTER WITHOUT PRE-MACHINE PROCESSING.A MACHINE CALENDAR SCANS LOAN PERIODS. OWING TO COMPUTERISATION ASNS HASELIMINATED 2| CARD INDEXES RECORDING INTERLIBRARY LOANS, (60|,000| CARDS P.A.),AND FREED STAFF FOR OTHER WORK. ASNS PLANS TO INTRODUCE AUTOMATION INTO OTHERSECTIONS.
4318|NO GRANDFATHER CLAUSE: REAPPRAISING ACCESSIONED RECORDS.     EVERY PUBLIC RECORDS REPOSITORY HAS ON ITS SHELVES RECORDS WHICH, IF OFFEREDTODAY, WOULD BE UNACCEPTABLE, AND YET SHELF SPACE IS STILL PROVIDED FOR THEM.FOR SUCH RECORDS THERE SHOULD BE NO 'GRANDFATHER CLAUSE'. DISCUSSES THEREASONS FOR THE KEEPING OF RECORDS OF QUESTIONABLE VALUE, AND SUGGESTS AREAPPRAISAL PROCEDURE, WITH AN INTERVAL OF REAPPRAISAL OF PERHAPS 20| TO 30|YEARS. DISCUSSES APPRAISAL METHODS, STRESSING THE CARE THAT MUST BE TAKEN IFUNIQUE AND IMPORTANT RECORDS ARE NOT TO BE DESTROYED.
4319|SAMPLING IN ARCHIVES' AN ESSAY ILLUSTRATING THE VALUE OF MATHEMATICALLY BASEDSAMPLING AND THE USAGE OF TECHNIQUES OTHER THAN SIMPLE RANDOM SAMPLING WITHINARCHIVES; OR, COPING WITH 10|,000| FEET OF INVOICES BEFORE RETIREMENT.     DISCUSSES WHAT SAMPLING IS, REFUTING THE CLAIM THAT ARCHIVAL SAMPLING ANDMATHEMATICAL SAMPLING ARE DISTINCT AND SEPARATE METHODS; ADDRESSES THE PROBLEMOF IMPLEMENTATION, IN PARTICULAR TO SUGGEST AN ALTERNATE TECHNQIUE TO SIMPLERANDOM SAMPLING; AND DEMONSTRATES THE LEGITIMACY OF SAMPLING BY REPORTING THERESULTS OF IT CARRIED OUT ON A TYPICAL ARCHIVAL RECORD GROUP, OF KNOWN VALUES.

A STUDY OF THE FUTURE OF CONSERVATIONOF LIBRARY AND ARCHIVE MATERIALS AS VIEWED BY 2| GROUPS OF EXPERTS-PEOPLECURRENTLY ACTIVE IN THE FIELD OF CONSERVATION AND REGULAR LIBRARY SCHOOLFACULTY MEMBERS. ASKS WHETHER PRESERVATIONISTS AND LIBRARY EDUCATORS SEE THEFUTURE IN SIMILAR FASHIONS AND WHETHER THEIR FUNDAMENTAL VIEWS ARE HELDSTRONGLY ENOUGH TO AFFECT THEIR ROLES IN PROVIDING CONSERVATION TRAINING.
4321|ST INTERNATIONAL SEMINAR ON THE PROBLEMS OF CONSERVATION AND RESTORATION INNATIONAL LIBRARIES.G     IVES A BRIEF ACCOUNT OF THE 1|ST INTERNATIONAL SEMINAR ON THE 'PROBLEMS OFCONSERVATION AND RESTORATION OF NATIONAL LIBRARY COLLECTIONS' HELD 16|-21| JUNE80| AT THE DEUTSCHE BUCHEREI IN LEIPZIG. SPECIALISTS FROM EASTERN EUROPE ANDTHE USSR MET TO DISCUSS CURRENT NATIONAL POLICIES ON THE PRESERVATION OFNATIONAL LIBRARY COLLECTIONS AND METHODS OF CONSERVATION AND RESTORATION OFBOOKS, PERIODICALS AND NEWSPAPERS. A RESOLUTION WAS ADOPTED TO INCREASEINTERNATIONAL COOPERATION IN THESE FIELDS. IN PRACTICE THIS WILL MEAN HOLDINGREGULAR MEETINGS AND A SYSTEMATIC EXCHANGE OF THE LATEST RESEARCH RESULTS ANDTECHNOLOGY AMONG THE MEMBERS OF THE COMECON. GREATER PARTICIPATION IN RELEVANTINTERNATIONAL ORGANISATIONS, ESPECIALLY IFLA, IS ALSO IMPORTANT.
4322|FIRST IMPRESSIONS OF THE CHIEF CONSERVATION OFFICER' THE CHALLENGE IS IMMENSE.     DISCUSSES BRIEFLY THE MAIN CONSERVATION NEEDS OF THE HUMANITIES RESEARCHCENTER AT THE UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN, AND DESCRIBES WHAT HAS BEEN DONE SOFAR TO MEET THEM, INCLUDING THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A CONSERVATION COMMITTEECOMPRISED OF VARIOUS DEPARTMENTS AT THE CENTER, AND THE INITIATION OF ATRAINING PROGRAMME FOR THE CONSERVATION OF LIBRARY AND ARCHIVAL MATERIALS.
4323|GRANT FUNDS PROVIDE IMPETUS FOR COMPREHENSIVE CONSERVATION PROGRAM.     RESEARCH LIBRARIES EVERYWHERE FACE THE PROBLEM OF CONSERVATION OF LIBRARYMATERIALS. FUNDING FROM FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS, IN THE PAST FEW YEARS,STIMULATED RESEARCH, SPECIAL PROJECTS, AND PROGRAMMES SUCH AS THE NATIONALCONSERVATION ADVISORY COUNCIL AND THE NATIONAL PRESERVATION PROGRAM IN THEUSA. MORRIS LIBRARY, AT THE UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS, HAS EMBARKED UPON ACOMPREHENSIVE CONSERVATION PROGRAMME FOR ITS COLLECTIONS WITH GRANT FUNDS FROMSEVERAL FUNDING BODIES. ITS PROGRAMME IS DESCRIBED IN DETAIL. COMMITTED TOCONSERVATION ON A BROAD SCALE, THE UNIVERSITY AND MORRIS LIBRARY SUPPORTEFFORTS AIMED AT PRESERVING AND MAINTAINING RESEARCH MATERIALS VITAL TO THEUNIVERSITY'S EDUCATIONAL AND RESEARCH PROGRAMMES, AND THE SCHOLARLY COMMUNITYAT LARGE.
4324|EITHER WE MOVE OR ELSE WE STOP ACCEPTING MORE BOOKS.     DESCRIBES THE DEPOSIT LIBRARY AND ITS SPACE PROBLEMS. UNLESS THE LIBRARY MOVESFROM ITS PRESENT ACCOMMODATION IN THE BASEMENT OF THE LIBRARY SCHOOL WITHINHALF A YEAR, IT WILL HAVE TO START REFUSING BOOKS FROM PUBLIC LIBRARIES. THELIBRARY'S PURPOSE IS TO STORE BOOKS WHICH HAVE BEEN CULLED FROM PUBLICLIBRARIES AND TO LEND OR GIVE THEM TO OTHER LIBRARIES, AND THEREFORE IT MUSTNECESSARILY GROW AT A TIME WHEN OTHER LIBRARIES CONTRACT. THE LIBRARY BEGAN IN1968| WITH 1400| SQ.M.; LATER A FURTHER 175| SQ.M. WERE ADDED FOR SHELVING AND1000| SQ.M. IN A WAREHOUSE ELSEWHERE. A SUITABLE BUILDING OF 7700| SQ.M. IS NOWAVAILABLE CHEAPLY. WITH AN INCREASE OF 25|,000| VOLUMES A YEAR, THIS WOULDSECURE ENOUGH SPACE UNTIL THE 90|S. RUNNING COSTS WILL BE 5|.1| MILLION KR. IN 82|AS COMPARED TO THE PRESENT 3|.6| MILLION KR., AND COST OF ESTABLISHMENT WILL BE2|.7| MILLION KR. THE DANISH LIBRARY ASSOCIATION, THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OFLOCAL AUTHORITIES AND THE LIBRAR Y COUNCIL HAVE NOW RECOMMENDED THAT THE MONEYSHOULD COME FROM THE PUBLIC LIBRARIES' DISPOSITION FUND, NOT OTHERWISE USEDFOR SUCH PURPOSES, AS THE SOURCE OF THE LIBRARY'S FINANCE, THE PUBLICLIBRARIES' JOINT APPROPRIATION, WOULD BE UNABLE TO COPE. THE LIBRARY IS A LASTRESORT, AFTER THE CENTRAL LIBRARIES, FOR ORDINARY PEOPLE FOR THE LENDING OFOLDER BOOKS AND MEETS 55|% OF ENQUIRIES, A FIGURE WHICH WOULD BE HIGHER IF ACATALOGUE OF HOLDINGS EXISTED.
4325|TURNKEY SYSTEMS FOR LIBRARY CIRCULATION CONTROL' AN INTRODUCTION.     REVIEWS THE HISTORICAL BACKGROUND TO COMPUTERISED CIRCULATION CONTROL ANDGENERAL CHARACTERISTICS OF TURNKEY SYSTEMS AS AN INTRODUCTION TO A DETAILEDDISCUSSION OF 5| TURNKEY SYSTEMS (P.87|-125|).
4326|THE ISSUE CONTROL IS RIDDLED WITH ERRORS.     STATEMENTS BY THE DANISH LIBRARIANS' UNION SHOW THAT LIBRARIANS KNOW NOTHINGABOUT WORK IN THE TECHNICAL DEPARTMENTS AND ISSUE DESKS, WHERE OFFICE TRAINEDSTAFF, NOT LIBRARIANS, WORK; THEY THEREFORE TEND TO REJECT AUTOMATION IN THESEAREAS. THEY ARE, ON THE OTHER HAND, TRAINED IN BIBLIOGRAPHICAL SERVICES ANDHENCE APPROVE OF AUTOMATION OF THESE. THE FACT IS, HOWEVER, THAT PRESENTMANUAL ISSUE CONTROL SYSTEMS ARE WORKING VERY POORLY' BOOKS ARE BEING RECALLEDWHICH ARE ALREADY RETURNED OR HAVE NEVER BEEN BORROWED. REFERS TO A NEGLECTEDREPORT OF 1979| BY A COMMITTEE OF HEADS OF ISSUE DESKS, WHICH RECOMMENDSEXPERIMENTS WITH AUTOMATED ISSUE CONTROL SYSTEMS AND IN PARTICULAR SUPPORTS ANAUTOMATIC RECALL SYSTEM. THE ISSUE DESK STAFF OF THE AUTOMATED OLSTYKKELIBRARY HAVE ALSO EXPRESSED POSITIVE VIEWS ON THEIR AUTOMATIC SYSTEM, VIEWSFOR WHICH THEY HAVE BEEN REPRIMANDED BY THE LIBRARIANS' UNION.
4327|COMPUTERISED CIRCULATION.     REPORT OF A 1980| STUDY VISIT TO 11| AMERICAN UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES ANALYSING THEPROBLEMS INVOLVED IN INSTALLING AN AUTOMATED LOAN SYSTEM.

4328|EFFICIENT FINDING AIDS' DEVELOPING A SYSTEM FOR CONTROL OF ARCHIVES ANDMANUSCRIPTS.     DESCRIBES SOME GENERAL PRINCIPLES AND PRACTICES THAT CONTRIBUTE TO THE EASEAND EFFICIENCY WITH WHICH ARCHIVAL FINDING AIDS CAN BE PRODUCED, MAINTAINEDAND USED. A CONTEMPLATION OF POTENTIAL FUTURE AUTOMATION MIGHT BE A WAY TOBRING SUCH PRACTICES INTO FOCUS AND DEVELOP A RATIONALE FOR THEIR SYSTEMATICAPPLICATION.
4329|FINDING AIDS' A MULTI-MEDIA, SYSTEMS PERSPECTIVE.     COMPREHENSIVE DISCUSSION OF FINDING AIDS FOR ARCHIVAL MATERIAL. THETRADITIONAL ASSUMPTION THAT THE FINDING AID IS PREPARED BY AN INDIVIDUALREPOSITORY IS TOO INSULAR. THE PERSPECTIVE MUST EXPAND TO INCLUDE FINDING AIDSRELATED TO ACCUMULATIONS OF PHOTOGRAPHS, MACHINE-READABLE FILES, ORAL HISTORYTAPES AND TRANSCRIPTS, MOTION PICTURES AND SIMILAR MEDIA, AND NOT MERELYTRADITIONAL PAPER RECORDS. EXAMINES THE POSSIBILITY OF DEVELOPING SUCHMULTI-MEDIA FINDING AIDS.
4330|ON SOME PROBLEMS OF SUBJECT CATALOGUING AT THE WISMAR COLLEGE OF ENGINEERINGLIBRARY.     THE WISMAR COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING LIBRARY USES A CLASSIFIED CATALOGUE FORSUBJECT CATALOGUING WHICH WAS INTRODUCED IN 1970|. IT IS BASED ON THEHIERARCHIC UNIVERSAL CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM OF THE ROSTOCK UNIVERSITY LIBRARY.THIS IS SUITABLE FOR THE STOCK OF THE WISMAR LIBRARY WHICH COVERS A VERY WIDERANGE OF SUBJECTS. THE SYSTEMATIC CATALOGUE HAS A FLEXIBLE NOTATION SYSTEMWHICH CAN COVER COMPLEX TERMS EXTENDING TO 6| COLUMNS AND ALSO HAS KEYWORDS'GENERAL, GEOGRAPHICAL, CHRONOLOGICAL, LINGUISTIC AND LITERATURE. THESYSTEMATICS WORK AT THE WISMAR LIBRARY HAS SEVERAL OBJECTIVES' TO ADAPT THEROSTOCK UNIVERSITY LIBRARY'S UNIVERSAL CLASSIFICATION TO THE SPECIALISEDWISMAR COLLECTION; TO OVERCOME THE PROBLEMS ARISING FROM SCIENTIFICDEVELOPMENTS BY EXPANDING AND BRINGING UP TO DATE THE SCHEDULES; AND TO WORKOUT NEW SYSTEMS IN CASES WHERE THE LIMITS OF EXISTING ONES ARE REACHED. WHERETHIS HAS BEEN NECESSARY 2| C ATALOGUES HAVE SOMETIMES BEEN IN EXISTENCESIMULTANEOUSLY TO AVOID LOSS OF INFORMATION FOR THE USER.
4331|DOCUMENTARY ANALYSIS OF VISUAL RESOURCES' THE METHODS USED TO DATE.     A COMPREHENSIVE ACCOUNT, BASED ON RECENT LITERATURE COVERING' DIFFICULTIES INANALYSING IMAGES FOR DOCUMENTATION PURPOSES; CATALOGUING AND SUBJECT HEADINGS,WITH REFERENCE TO LISTS AND ILLUSTRATED CATALOGUES PREPARED BY SPECIALLIBRARIES; THE CLASSIFICATION OF IMAGES, IN RELATION TO THE INADEQUACY OFCONVENTIONAL SYSTEMS, SYSTEMS DEVELOPED FOR SLIDE COLLECTIONS, ARCHIVALCLASSIFICATIONS, AND CLASSIFICATION OF PHOTOGRAPHIC TECHNIQUES; AND INDEXINGPROCEDURES USED BY SPECIAL LIBRARIES IN THE FIELDS OF PETROLEUM, MANAGEMENTAND URBAN PLANNING, MEDICINE, EDUCATION, ARCHAEOLOGY AND THE HISTORY OF ART,THE PLASTIC ARTS, AND METHODS DEVELOPED TO TAKE ACCOUNT OF THE SEMIOLOGICALCONNOTATIONS OF IMAGES. BIBLIOGRAPHICAL REFERENCES ARE PROVIDED FOR ALLMETHODS AND SYSTEMS REFERRED TO. THE NEED FOR FURTHER RESEARCH TO DEVELOPWHOLLY SATISFACTORY TECHNIQUES IS EMPHASISED.
4332|ON THE ACCESS TO CARTOGRAPHIC COLLECTIONS IN GDR LIBRARIES.     SUITABLE CATALOGUING AND CLASSIFICATION OF CARTOGRAPHIC COLLECTIONS OFFERS THEUSER EASIER ACCESS TO THESE MATERIALS AND OFFERS THE LIBRARIAN A FUNDAMENTALBASIS FOR PROVIDING INFORMATION AND PROMOTING OPTIMAL USE OF HIS COLLECTIONS.HERE, THE METHODS OF CLASSIFICATION WHICH ARE USED IN EAST GERMANY ARELINEATED USING EXAMPLES FROM THE MOST SIGNIFICANT MAP COLLECTIONS.
4333|AUTHORITY CONTROL' UNNECESSARY DETAIL OF NEEDED SUPPORT?.     AUTHORITY CONTROL IS THE SET OF PROCEDURES WHICH DETERMINES THE USE OFCONSISTENT NAMES AND TERMINOLOGY, CHANGING RELATIONSHIPS AMONG SCHOLARLYDISCIPLINES, CORPORATE BODIES, AND GOVERNMENT AGENCIES. GIVES EXAMPLES OFAUTHORITY WORK FOR PERSONAL NAMES, CORPORATE NAMES, GOVERNMENT AGENCIES,SERIES TITLES AND SUBJECT HEADINGS. SUGGESTS THAT AUTHORITY CONTROL ISESSENTIAL BECAUSE' CATALOGUES ARE GROWING AND BECOMING MORE DIFFICULT TO USESO THE USER MAY EASILY GET LOST WITHOUT AN AUTHORITY STRUCTURE TO PROVIDEGUIDANCE; AND IF LIBRARIES FOLLOW GENERALLY THE SAME STANDARDS IN ESTABLISHINGBIBLIOGRAPHIC RECORDS, THE TASK OF MATCHING RECORDS AMONG LIBRARIES WILL BEMADE CONSIDERABLY EASIER.
4334|THE MALAYSIAN MARC (MALMARC) PROJECT.     THE MALAYSIAN MARC (MALMARC) PROJECT, WHICH IS ONE OF 5| COOPERATIVE PROGRAMMESINVOLVING THE 5| UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES AND THE NATIONAL LIBRARY OF MALAYSIA,CONSTITUTES ONE OF THE COMPONENTS OF THE DEVELOPING MALAYSIAN RESEARCH LIBRARYNETWORK. THE PROJECT BEGAN IN OCT 77| AS AN EXPERIMENT AS A RESULT OF AFEASIBILITY STUDY, AND BECAME AN OPERATIONAL SYSTEM IN JULY 79|. DURING THEEXPERIMENTAL PERIOD, COSTING STUDIES WERE UNDERTAKEN AND THESE REVEALED THATFOR ALL THE PARTICIPATING INSTITUTIONS, AN AUTOMATED CATALOGUING SYSTEM WASCHEAPER THAN THE MANUAL SYSTEM. THE MALMARC SYSTEM IS CURRENTLY BEING OPERATEDBY THE MALMARC COORDINATING CENTRE AT THE UNIVERSITI SAINS MALAYSIA. DETAILSOF THE SYSTEM TOGETHER WITH FLOWCHARTS ARE PROVIDED.

4337|NETWORK SERVICE CENTERS AND THEIR EXPANDING ROLE.     THE GROWTH OF OCLC AS AN AUTOMATED LIBRARY RESOURCE-SHARING SYSTEM HAS BEENMADE POSSIBLE IN PART BY INTERMEDIARY ORGANISATIONS, OR NETWORKS, THATFUNCTION AS MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTING AGENTS FOR OCLC SERVICES. AS THEY HAVEGROWN, THE NETWORKS HAVE TAKEN ON OTHER ROLES. THE RESULTS OF A SURVEY OF THEDIRECTORS OF THE NETWORKS REVEAL PATTERNS OF SERVICE BEYOND OCLC, AND INDICATETHAT THE NETWORKS PROVIDE, OR PLAN TO PROVIDE, AUTOMATED LIBRARY SUPPORTSYSTEMS THEMSELVES. SURVEY RESULTS ALSO REVEAL BROKERAGE OF OTHER AUTOMATEDSERVICES, NETWORKS' REVENUE SOURCES, STAFF SIZE AND GROWTH, AND FUTURE PLANS.
4338|ENTRY OF LOCAL DATA ON OCLC' THE OPTIONS AND THEIR IMPACT ON THE PROCESSING OFARCHIVAL TAPES.     THE OCLC SYSTEM ALLOWS FOR A GREAT DEAL OF FLEXIBILITY IN ENTERING INSTITUTIONSPECIFIC DATA FOR AN ITEM. IN THE PAST, POLICIES FOR ENTERING LOCAL DATA HAVEBEEN FORMULATED IN MANY LIBRARIES ON THE BASIS OF CATALOGUE CARD APPEARANCE,BUT THE INCREASING USE OF OCLC TAPE PRODUCTS REQUIRES REEXAMINATION OF MANY OFTHE LOCAL DATA PRACTICES NOW IN USE. A SURVEY WAS CONDUCTED BY THEBIBLIOGRAPHICAL CENTER FOR RESEARCH IN ORDER TO DETERMINE THE EXTENT OFVARIATIONS FOR ENTERING LOCAL DATA ON THE PART OF BCR OCLC LIBRARIES. THERESULTS ARE PRESENTED HERE, ALONG WITH A DISCUSSION OF ALTERNATIVE PRACTICESAND THEIR IMPACT ON THE PROCESSING OF OCLC TAPES.

4344|PROBLEMS IN APPLYING AACR2| TO MUSIC MATERIALS.     SUCCESSIVE REVISIONS IN CATALOGUING CODES HAVE POSED SPECIAL PROBLEMS FORMUSIC MATERIALS PRIMARILY BECAUSE THE ECONOMICS OF MUSIC PUBLISHING HAVEDICTATED TRADITIONAL DEPARTURES IN BIBLIOGRAPHIC PRESENTATION. THE ADOPTION OFAACR2| ADDITIONALLY FOCUSES ON THE UNIQUE PROBLEM OF PARTICIPATORY CREATION INMUSIC; THE PERFORMER AS AUTHOR. STUDIES THE IMPACT OF THESE PHENOMENA ONCERTAIN MATTERS OF DESCRIPTION, ACCESS POINTS, AND UNIFORM TITLES.
4345|AUTHORS AND NAMES' MULTIPLE PSEUDONYMS IN AACR2|.     THE HISTORY OF CATALOGUING PSEUDONYMS IS REVIEWED. AACR2| REVERSES ACENTURY-LONG CATALOGUING PRACTICE BY ALLOWING AUTHORS WHO USE SEVERALPSEUDONYMS TO BE ENTERED IN THE CATALOGUE UNDER EACH NAME. THIS VIOLATES THECATALOGUE'S OBJECTIVES AS FORMULATED BY LUBETZKY AND IS CONTRADICTORY TOAACR2|'S OWN INTERNAL LOGIC. THE NUMBER OF DISADVANTAGES TO THIS RULE FAROUTWEIGH ANY ADVANTAGES. IT SHOULD BE REPLACED.
4346|REMARKS ON THE PRE-PRINT OF RAK-WB.

CONSIDERS THESIGNIFICANCE OF 2| OF THE STUDY'S FINDINGS' (1|) THAT A RELATIVELY HIGHPROPORTION OF PEOPLE WORKING IN THE PROFESSION WANT TO GET OUT; AND (2|) THATCOMPARED WITH THE PROPORTION OF SUCH GROUPS IN OTHER PROFESSIONS, LIBRARIANSAND INFORMATION WORKERS SEEMED TO DISPLAY A FAIRLY HIGH LEVEL OF AMBIVERTMOTIVATION, WHICH INDICATES A BALANCED AND ROUNDED MOTIVATION AND TYPE OFPERSONALITY. ALSO CONCLUDES THAT THE PUBLIC IMAGE OF THE LIBRARIAN IS IN THEPROCESS OF CHANGE.
4464|MEANINGS OF THE INFORMATION NOTION-A DEBATABLE AND TOPICAL PROBLEM.     ANALYSES THE CONCEPT OF 'INFORMATION' AND THE MEANINGS WHICH THE TERM HASACQUIRED. AFTER A DISCUSSION OF THE VARIOUS DEFINITIONS OF INFORMATION,SUGGESTS THAT THE DEFINITION OF THE CONCEPT SHOULD BE A SYNTHETIC AND POSITIVEEXPRESSION-AN ESSENTIAL ENTITY WHICH IS GENERATED IN THE CONTEXT OF THESEMIOTIC SITUATION, IS ESTABLISHED IN THE FIELD OF SIGNS AND/OR SIGNALS ANDBECOMES THE SUBSTANCE AND ESSENCE OF ANY COMMUNICATION.
4465|INFORMATION, THOUGHT AND LANGUAGE.     DEBATES CONCERNING THE CONCEPT OF 'INFORMATION' EMPHASISE SEVERAL IMPORTANTASPECTS OF THE THOUGHT/SPEECH RELATIONSHIP, PLEADING FOR THE REFRESHMENT OFSCIENTIFIC LANGUAGE. ANALYSES CONTRADICTORY OPINIONS REGARDING THEORTHOLOGICAL STATUS AND THE MEANING OF THE TERM 'INFORMATION', AND INDICATESCERTAIN DELIMITATIONS, UNDERLINING THE INTRICATE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEENINFORMATION AND ITS SIGNIFICANCE, AND BETWEEN INFORMATION AND THOUGHT. ARGUESAGAINST THE USE OF THE TERM INFORMATION IN THE MATHEMATICAL SENSE, CONSIDERINGIT TERMINOLOGICALLY CONFUSING.

BY USING THE COMPUTER TO COMPARE SOCIOECONOMIC AND PROFESSIONALCHARACTERISTICS OF ALA EXECUTIVE BOARD AND COUNCIL MEMBERS BETWEEN 1876| AND1917|, IDENTIFIES A COLLECTIVE PROFILE OF BOTH GROUPS IN ORDER TO TEST THEHYPOTHESIS THAT THE COUNCIL WAS MORE 'DEMOCRATIC' THAN THE EXECUTIVE BOARD.TEST RESULTS REVEAL CONSIDERABLE HOMOGENEITY THROUGHOUT THE 41|-YEAR ANALYSISPERIOD, BUT THE PERIOD FROM 1900|-1917| DOES DEMONSTRATE SEVERAL HETEROGENEOUSAREAS WORTHY OF FURTHER STUDY.
4467|THE WORK MARKET.     ARGUES FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF LIBRARIANSHIP TRAINING PROGRAMMES THAT WILLTRULY PREPARE THE PROFESSIONAL TO MEET THE NEEDS OF A WORK MARKET DETERMINED,IN BRAZIL, BY THE SOCIAL CONDITIONS OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. THERE IS NOW ANINCREASING DEMAND FOR LIBRARIANS, BUT LIBRARY SCHOOLS DO NOT GEAR THEIRPROGRAMMES TO PROVIDE TRAINING FOR ACTUAL SOCIAL SITUATIONS. ONCE THE NATUREOF THE MARKET NEEDS IS UNDERSTOOD, TRAINING POLICIES CAN BE ADAPTEDACCORDINGLY.

AFTER A SHORT OUTLINE OF THE PRE-1978| AUSTRIAN LIBRARYEDUCATION, CONCENTRATES ON THE DESCRIPTION OF THE NEW SYSTEM IN OPERATION FROM1979|. TRAINING IN LIBRARIANSHIP, DOCUMENTATION AND INFORMATION SCIENCE IS NOTPROVIDED BY ANY ACADEMIC INSTITUTION IN AUSTRIA AND IS THEREFORE CARRIED OUTBY LIBRARIES AND INFORMATION CENTRES. LIBRARY EDUCATION IS DIVIDED INTOCATEGORIES A, B, AND C ACCORDING TO THE LEVEL OF GENERAL EDUCATION OFSTUDENTS. A-UNIVERSITY EDUCATION, B-SECONDARY SCHOOL CERTIFICATES,C-UNCERTIFIED SECONDARY SCHOOL LEAVERS. 5| MAIN DISCIPLINES TAUGHT ARE' LAW,LIBRARY ORGANISATION, HISTORICAL BIBLIOGRAPHY AND AUDIO-VISUAL MATERIALS,PROCESSING, AND THE STORAGE AND DISSEMINATION OF INFORMATION.

4472|INTRODUCTION.     CONTRIBUTION TO A THEMATIC ISSUE ON LIBRARY TRAINING. THE PRESENT CONTENT,LEVEL AND FRAMEWORK OF HUNGARIAN LIBRARY TRAINING IS UNSATISFACTORY'CURRICULUM UNITS ARE NOT BUILT UPON EACH OTHER; THE SUBJECTS STUDIED ARE NOTSEPARATED ENOUGH ON EACH LEVEL AND ARE NOT ADEQUATELY COORDINATED; AND THECOMBINATION OF SUBJECTS DOES NOT REFLECT THE DEMANDS MADE ON LIBRARIES. THENUMBER OF STUDENTS WHO GO ON TO WORK IN LIBRARIES IS NOT KNOWN. THEAUTHORITIES HAVE ASKED FOR SUGGESTIONS FOR IMPROVING EDUCATION FORLIBRARIANSHIP.
4473|CHRONOLOGY OF THE CHANGES IN HUNGARIAN LIBRARY TRAINING AND EXTENSION TRAINING.     CONTRIBUTION TO A THEMATIC ISSUE ON LIBRARY TRAINING. LISTS IN CHRONOLOGICALORDER THE CHANGES IN HUNGARIAN LIBRARY TRAINING SINCE 1947|.
4474|SCIENTIFIC LIBRARIAN? LIBRARY SCIENTIST? SCIENTIFICALLY TRAINED LIBRARIAN? ORDEVELOPING TRAINING DEMANDS OF A DEVELOPING PROFESSION.     CONTRIBUTION TO A THEMATIC ISSUE ON LIBRARY TRAINING. LASZLO MATRAI HASSUGGESTED THAT LIBRARY SCIENCE DOES NOT EXIST AND THAT A LIBRARIAN SHOULD BE ASCIENTIST OF THE SUBJECT FIELD CARED FOR AND SERVED BY HIM, BUT BY NO MEANS ALIBRARY SCIENTIST. THUS LIBRARY SKILLS SHOULD BE ATTAINED BY PRACTICE. THEAUTHOR FEELS THAT THE TRANSMISSION OF INFORMATION IN A LIBRARY IS A COMPLEXOPERATION, REQUIRING TRAINING AT A HIGHER EDUCATION LEVEL. THIS TRAINING,INCORPORATING UP-TO-DATE KNOWLEDGE, IS THE ESSENCE OF THE LIBRARY PROFESSIONAND IS ESSENTIAL IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND NETWORKS.
4475|LIBRARY CAREER, PROCESS OF CHANGES, DEVELOPMENT TENDENCIES.     CONTRIBUTION TO A THEMATIC ISSUE ON LIBRARY TRAINING. THE ACCELERATEDDEVELOPMENT OF CULTURE, SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY HAS RESULTED IN A NEW TYPE OFLIBRARY USER. THE USER NOW REQUIRES NOT ONLY LIBRARY MATERIAL, BUT ALSOANALYSED, EVALUATED INFORMATION. THIS IN TURN HAS GIVEN RISE TO NEWPROFESSIONAL BRANCHES OF LIBRARIANSHIP AND INFORMATION SCIENCE. SUMMARISES THEESSENTIAL ELEMENTS WHICH FORM AND SHAPE CAREERS IN THIS FIELD.
4476|LIBRARY TRAINING BASED ON INFORMATICS.     CONTRIBUTION TO A THEMATIC ISSUE ON LIBRARY TRAINING. INVESTIGATES THETHEORETICAL FOUNDATION OF UNIVERSITY LIBRARY TRAINING AND PROPOSES TRAININGBASED ON INFORMATICS.

4477|USE OF INFORMATION-SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT-LIBRARY TRAINING.     CONTRIBUTION TO A THEMATIC ISSUE ON LIBRARY TRAINING. COMPLETES TIBORHORVATH'S CONCEPTION, OUTLINING THE NECESSARY KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE USER ANDUTILISATION OF INFORMATION. THE THEMES OUTLINED ARE THE ESSENCE OF INFORMATIONUSE; THE OBJECTIVE INFORMATION NEEDS OF SOCIETY; THE SUBJECTIVE INFORMATIONDEMAND; THE PROCESS OF INFORMATION USE; GUIDANCE IN INFORMATION USE; ANDSERVING INFORMATION DEMANDS.
4478|SOME QUESTIONS OF LIBRARY TRAINING, RELATION OF UNIVERSITY AND HIGH SCHOOLTRAINING.     CONTRIBUTION TO A THEMATIC ISSUE ON LIBRARY TRAINING. LIBRARY TRAINING SHOULDBE BASED ON THE PROFESSION AND NOT ON THE SCOPE OF ACTIVITIES. GENERALPROFESSIONAL TRAINING SHOULD BE OFFERED RATHER THAN SPECIALIST TRAINING. THESUBJECTS COVERED SHOULD BE LINKED WITH EACH OTHER AND THE PROFESSION'SOBJECTIVES. HIGH SCHOOL AND UNIVERSITY TRAINING SHOULD BE SEPARATE, BUTCONNECTED IN SUCH A WAY THAT CROSSING FROM 1| TO THE OTHER IS MADE EASIER.

SUMMARISES THE AUTHOR'SEXPERIENCES AT THE SCHOOL OF LIBRARY SCIENCE, KENT STATE UNIVERSITY, OHIO (SHEIS A HOLDER OF THE GOMBOCZ SCHOLARSHIP). TO CARRY OUT EFFECTIVE AND ECONOMICHIGH-LEVEL LIBRARY WORK, SPECIALISTS MUST BE PREPARED TO MANAGE GENERALLIBRARY PROCESSES AS WELL. US LIBRARY SCHOOLS PAY SPECIAL ATTENTION TOTEACHING THE ANALYSIS, PLANNING AND ORGANISATION OF SUCH PROCESSES.
4482|NEW TRENDS IN LIBRARIANSHIP AND INFORMATION SCIENCE STUDIES.     THE DEPARTMENT OF LIBRARIANSHIP AND INFORMATION SCIENCE AT THE FACULTY OFPHILOSOPHY WITHIN THE COMENIUS UNIVERSITY IN BRATISLAVA HAS BEEN IN EXISTENCEFOR 30| YEARS. AT PRESENT, BOTH FULL-TIME AND PART-TIME UNDERGRADUATE ANDPOSTGRADUATE COURSES ARE OFFERED. IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE NEW IDEAS IN THECZECHOSLOVAK SYSTEM OF HIGHER EDUCATION, CURRICULA HAS RECENTLY BEEN SUBJECTEDTO PROFOUND AND SOMETIMES CONTROVERSIAL CHANGES. THE DURATION OF UNDERGRADUATECOURSES HAS BEEN REDUCED FROM 5| TO 4| YEARS. IT WILL CONCENTRATE ONLIBRARIANSHIP AND/OR INFORMATION SCIENCE AS WELL AS ON CLOSELY RELATEDSUBJECTS. THE AIM OF EQUIPPING STUDENTS WITH THE BASIC KNOWLEDGE IN THE FIELDOF THEIR PROSPECTIVE TYPE OF LIBRARY HAS BEEN ABANDONED. ALTHOUGH IT FELLSHORT OF EXPECTATIONS, THE EXTENSION OF THE DEPARTMENT'S BUILDING WILLNEVERTHELESS ENABLE THE TEACHING AND OTHER STAFF TO BUILD UP RESOURCES OFAUDIO-VISUAL AIDS AND OTHER ILLUSTRATIVE MATERIALS,  AND ALSO TO INVOLVE THEIRSTUDENTS IN RESEARCH PROJECTS.
4483|NEW ERA OF THE SCHOOL OF LIBRARIANSHIP IN BRATISLAVA.     THE SCHOOL OF LIBRARIANSHIP IN BRATISLAVA WAS FOUNDED IN 1953|, SIMULTANEOUSLYWITH SIMILAR SCHOOLS IN PRAGUE AND BRNO. AFTER OVERCOMING CONSIDERABLEDIFFICULTIES OF VARIOUS KINDS IN THE 1|ST 10| YEARS OF ITS HISTORY, THE SCHOOLHAS CONCENTRATED IN EDUCATING AND TRAINING PROSPECTIVE NON-GRADUATE LIBRARIANSAND INFORMATION SCIENTISTS. SO FAR ABOUT 3|,000| STUDENTS HAVE COMPLETED THEIRFULL-TIME OR PART-TIME COURSES. ALMOST 90|% OF THEM WORK IN LIBRARIES AND INCENTRES OF SCIENTIFIC, TECHNICAL AND ECONOMIC INFORMATION. COMMENCING IN THEACADEMIC YEAR 1984|-85|, NEW SYLLABUSES WILL COME INTO FORCE. THE COURSESOFFERED WILL BE FULL-TIME ONLY. AFTER 2| YEARS WITH A COMMON CURRICULUM,STUDENTS WILL TAKE UP EITHER LIBRARIANSHIP OR INFORMATION SCIENCE FOR THEREMAINING 2| YEARS, WHEN FINAL EXAMINATIONS OF A THEORETICAL AND PRACTICALNATURE WILL BE HELD. THE NEW PROJECT, WORKED OUT UNDER THE AUSPICES OF THERESEARCH INSTITUTE FOR VOCATIONAL EDUCATION AND  TRAINING IN PRAGUE, WILLBECOME A FURTHER STEP TOWARDS PROVIDING LIBRARIES AND INFORMATION CENTRES WITHCAPABLE STAFF.

SINCE 1976|, THESAID CONCEPT HAS ENJOYED OFFICIAL BACKING BY REGULATIONS ISSUED BY THE SLOVAKMINISTRY OF CULTURE. THE REGULATIONS ARE BINDING ON ALL CENTRAL AND OTHERMAJOR LIBRARIES. SO FAR, THE MOST IMPORTANT TRAINING PROJECTS HAVE BEENLAUNCHED BY MATICA SLOVENSKA AND BY THE SLOVAK TECHNICAL LIBRARY. IN-SERVICECOURSES SHOULD NOT ONLY INCLUDE LECTURES, BUT ALSO WORK IN SEMINARS ANDSMALLER GROUPS. VISITS TO SELECTED LIBRARIES AND DISCUSSIONS WITH THEIR STAFFSTIMULATE THE EXCHANGE OF VIEWS AND IDEAS. FILMS AND OTHER ILLUSTRATIVEMATERIALS MUST BE USED MORE FULLY. GRADUATES, CONTINUING THEIR STUDIES ABROAD,MUST BE ENCOURAGED TO CONCENTRATE ON TOPICAL PROBLE MS, AND TO AIM AT POSTSWITH RESPONSIBILITY. USERS OF LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SERVICES HAVE TO BEEDUCATED AND TRAINED, TOO, TO MAKE THE BEST OF THE RESOURCES AVAILABLE.STARTING WITH UNDERGRADUATES, THE SCHEME MUST BE EXPANDED TO INVOLVE THE WHOLENATION IN FUTURE.
4486|CONTINUING EDUCATION OF LIBRARIANS THROUGH PRIVATE STUDY.     REPORT ON A 2|-YEAR-SCHEME INTRODUCED BY THE CENTRAL REGIONAL LIBRARY IN RUSE,TO ENCOURAGE CONTINUING EDUCATION OF LIBRARIANS IN THE REGION THROUGH PRIVATESTUDY. INITIALLY, 75| TOPICS WERE OFFERED, AND 94|% OF FULL-TIME LIBRARIANS TOOKPART IN THE SCHEME. EVEN PROFESSIONAL LIBRARIANS WITH 10|, 15| AND MORE YEARS OFSERVICE WERE NOT EXCLUDED FROM THEORETICAL, CONTROVERSIAL AND/OR INNOVATIVETHEMES. THEY ALSO WIDELY EXPLORED SOVIET PERIODICALS AND LITERATURE INRUSSIAN. THE ATTITUDE AND RESPONSE OF BEGINNERS AND SOME LIBRARY ASSISTANTSAPPEARED TO BE LESS ENTERPRISING AND ENTHUSIASTIC, IN SOME CASES EVEN FORMAL.IT IS HOPED, HOWEVER, THAT THEIR PROFESSIONAL ETHICS WILL IMPROVE IN FUTURE.REGULAR MEETINGS WITH THEIR TUTORS, RESULTING IN THE INEVITABLE EXCHANGE OFVIEWS AND OPINIONS WERE OF BENEFICIAL INFLUENCE IN THE STUDY. A POSITIVEEVALUATION OF THE SCHEME MUST BE FOLLOWED BY FURTHER EXPERIMENTATION,SEARCHING AND STRIVING FOR IMPROVE MENT.

4491|ARCHIVAL EDUCATION AND TRAINING IN THE UNITED STATES, 1937| TO PRESENT.     FROM ALMOST ITS INCEPTION IN 1937|, ARCHIVAL EDUCATION AND TRAINING HAS BEENPRIMARILY A POST-EMPLOYMENT EFFORT. THIS IS ATTRIBUTED TO THE INDIFFERENCE OFTHE PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATIONS IN BOTH THE FIELDS OF LIBRARIANSHIP AND HISTORY,THE 2| MAIN DISCIPLINES FROM WHICH MANUSCRIPT LIBRARIANS AND ARCHIVISTS AREDRAWN. BETWEEN 1937|-40| AND 1967|-70|, THE AMERICAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION BECAMEPERIPHERALLY INTERESTED. THE HISTORY PROFESSION HAS BECOME MORE ACTIVE SINCETHE EARLY 1970|S IN ITS SEARCH FOR ALTERNATIVE CAREERS FOR ASPIRING HISTORIANS.INDIVIDUAL LIBRARY SCHOOLS ALSO HAVE BEEN OFFERING ARCHIVAL MANAGEMENT COURSESSINCE THE EARLY 1960|S PARTICULARLY. BY LACKING ACADEMIC STATUS, THE AMERICANLITERATURE IN THE ARCHIVAL FIELD HAS ALSO BEEN UNDERDEVELOPED, AND THIS HASCONTRIBUTED TO THE SLOWNESS IN DEVELOPING ADEQUATE INTELLECTUAL CONTROL OFARCHIVAL/MANUSCRIPT SOURCES. AN ATTEMPT IN 1967|-70| TO DEVELOP AN ARCHIVALMANUAL WITHI N A.L.A. DIED ABORNING AND THE HISTORICAL ASSOCIATIONS ANDSOCIETY OF AMERICAN ARCHIVISTS HAVE JUST BEGUN TO COPE WITH THE PROBLEMINDEPENDENTLY.

THE BASIC THEMEWAS DISCUSSED WITH REFERENCE TO INDIVIDUAL COUNTRIES IN AFRICA, ASIA AND LATINAMERICA, WHERE MANY CHILDREN ATTEND SCHOOL ONLY BRIEFLY OR NOT AT ALL, SO THEYREMAIN ILLITERATE. MANY PARENTS ARE ALSO ILLITERATE SO READING IN LEISUREHOURS IS NOT ENCOURAGED. WHAT SCHOOL BOOKS AND LESSONS THERE ARE EXIST ONLY INAN OFFICIAL LANGUAGE, GENERALLY THAT OF A COLONISING POWER. THERE IS A LACK OFPUBLISHED MATERIAL IN LOCAL LANGUAGES, SOME OF WHICH HAVE NEVER EVEN BEENWRITTEN DOWN. IN THESE COUNTRIES A LIBRARY NETWORK MUST BE ESTABLISHED AND THEGROWTH OF READING ENCOURAGED WITH THE HELP OF PROFESSIONAL AND VOLUNTARYSTAFF. LIBRARY SERVICE FOR THE HANDICAPPED POSE SPECIAL PROBLEMS.

IN PRE-COLONIALTIMES EDUCATION IN MALI WAS PROVIDED WITHIN THE FAMILY; IN THE COLONIALPERIODS, THE MEDIAEVAL BERBERS AND 19|TH CENTURY FRENCH ESTABLISHED SOMESCHOOLS AND LIBRARIES. BETWEEN 1960| AND 1980|, AFTER INDEPENDENCE, THEEDUCATION SYSTEM WAS REFORMED AND A LITERACY CAMPAIGN PROMOTED IN THECOUNTRY'S 4| MAIN LANGUAGES. SINCE THE 1970|S 46| PUBLIC LIBRARIES HAVE BEENOPENED, EACH OF WHICH CONTAINS A CHILDREN'S DEPARTMENT. KEYPOINTS IN THEDEVELOPMENT OF CHILDREN'S LIBRARIES ARE THE PRODUCTION OF SUITABLE LITERATURE,STOCK EXPANSION AND STAFF TRAINING, A PROGRAMME COORDINATED BY THE CENTRALLIBRARY FOR CHILDREN'S LITERATURE IN BAMAKO. LIBRARIANS, AUTHORS ANDPUBLISHERS ARE WORKING TOGETHER TO MAKE COLLECTIONS OF NATIONAL LEGENDS ANDSTORIES, ORGANISE CULTURAL EVENTS AND ENCOURAGE LIBRARY USE.

PROVIDES A PLAN TO STANDARDISE DEVELOPMENT IN THESTATE-CONTROLLED PUBLIC AND SCHOOL LIBRARIES IN MALTA, OVER A 10|-YEAR PERIOD,IN LIGHT OF THE FAILURE OF THE 7|-YEAR MALTA DEVELOPMENT PLAN TO MENTIONLIBRARY DEVELOPMENT. STRESSES THE FACT THAT MALTA HAS A SUFFICIENTLY WELLEDUCATED AND APPRECIATIVE POPULATION TO EMBARK ON SUCH A PROGRAMME OFINTEGRATED SERVICE AND PROVISION.
4574|SCHOOL LIBRARIES-A DREAM OF THE 1970|S.     EDUCATIONAL REFORM CANNOT TAKE PLACE WITHOUT THE INCLUSION OF THE BASICCULTURAL TECHNOLOGY. PARTICULAR SUCCESS IN THIS FIELD HAS BEEN SHOWN IN THE 3|COMBINED SCHOOL AND PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN HANOVER, WHICH CONTAINS A WIDE RANGEOF MATERIAL AND EQUIPMENT FOR CLASS AND INDIVIDUAL STUDY AND FOR LEISUREACTIVITIES. IF PURCHASING, PROCESSING AND CONTROL OF SCHOOL LIBRARY MEDIASTOCKS ARE TO BE INTEGRATED INTO CENTRALISED PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVICES, THERIGHT TO FINANCIAL PROVISION MUST BE GUARANTEED. MORE CLARITY IS NEEDEDREGARDING THE CALCULATION OF PROCESSING COSTS; STAFFING COSTS SHOULD BE BORNEBY LOCAL GOVERNMENT, MATERIAL AND BINDING COSTS BY THE SCHOOLS. SOME PROBLEMSCONCERNING THE ORGANISATION OF USE PROCEDURES, E.G. TICKET WRITING AND FINECOLLECTION, REMAIN UNSOLVED.
4575|THE MINISTER HAS BEEN LED ASTRAY.     THE CONTRIBUTION BY A MEMBER OF THE DANISH LIBRARY ASSOCIATION'S EXECUTIVECOMMITTEE TO A DEBATE ON SCHOOL LIBRARIES HELD AT THE DANISH SCHOOL LIBRARYASSOCIATION'S ANNUAL MEETING, OCT 81|. ARGUES THAT THE MINISTRY OF CULTURE INITS LIBRARY BILL HAS DISREGARDED THE LIBRARY COMMISSION'S PROPOSALS FOR SCHOOLLIBRARIES. ALTHOUGH RESEARCH LIBRARIES WERE NOT INCLUDED IN THE 1964| LIBRARYACT, A UNIFIED LIBRARY SYSTEM WAS BROUGHT ABOUT WITH THE INCLUSION OF SCHOOLLIBRARIES. THE IDEAL OF UNITY IS NOW BEING SET ASIDE. BUT IF THE SCHOOLLIBRARIES ARE TO BE TRANSFERRED TO THE SCHOOLS, THE MINIMUM DEMAND TO ENSURETHEIR EXISTENCE MUST BE BY-LAWS GOVERNING THEIR RELATIONSHIP TO PUBLICLIBRARIES AND A SEPARATE BUDGET. THESE REQUIREMENTS WERE CONFIRMED BY THEMINISTER OF CULTURE. YET THE LIBRARY BILL MAKES NO MENTION OF THEM AND REDUCESTHE SEPARATE BUDGET TO AN ACCOUNTING ITEM IN THE LOCAL AUTHORITY FINANCES. THEBILL IS, THEREFORE, TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE TO THE DANISH LI BRARY ASSOCIATION.
4576|SCHOOL LIBRARIES IN LOWER SAXONY.     LECTURE GIVEN TO THE CONFERENCE OF LIBRARIANS IN LOWER SAXONY, CELLE, APR 81|.SINCE 1979| THE SCHOOL LIBRARY CENTRE IN HANOVER HAS PROVIDED CENTRALISEDPURCHASING, PROCESSING AND ADVISORY SERVICES FOR THE SCHOOL LIBRARIES IN ITSAREA. THE QUESTION AS TO WHETHER SCHOOL LIBRARIES SHOULD BE RUN BY LIBRARIANSOR TEACHERS IS STILL DISPUTED. SCHOOL LIBRARIES ARE PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT IN'THE REFORMED GRAMMAR SCHOOL, WHERE THEY PROMOTE INDEPENDENT STUDY ANDCOOPERATION BETWEEN TEACHERS AND PUPILS; SCHOOLS OPEN ALL DAY, WHERE THELIBRARY BECOMES A COMMUNICATION CENTRE CATERING FOR LEISURE AS WELL ASACADEMIC ACTIVITY; VOCATIONAL TRAINING SCHOOLS, WHERE THEY CATER FOR STUDENTSFROM ALL LEVELS OF SECONDARY EDUCATION, PROVIDE SPECIAL HELP FOR FOREIGNSTUDENTS WITH LANGUAGE PROBLEMS AND DEVELOP POSSIBILITIES FOR JOB FLEXIBILITY.CLEAR, PREFERABLY BINDING, REGULATIONS ON COOPERATION BETWEEN SCHOOL ANDPUBLIC LIBRARIES ARE NEEDED.
4577|THE DEVELOPMENT OF SCHOOL LIBRARIES IN THE CZECHOSLOVAK SOCIALIST REPUBLIC.     SCHOOL LIBRARIES IN CZECHOSLOVAKIA CAME TO LIFE AT THE BEGINNING OF THE LASTCENTURY, BUT THEIR FULL DEVELOPMENT BEGAN AFTER WORLD WAR II. IN 1976| AREORGANISATION TOOK PLACE AIMED AT TEACHING PUPILS TO FIND OUT REQUIREDINFORMATION INDEPENDENTLY AND CREATIVELY. THE IMPLICATION OF THIS WITH ITSRESULTING TASKS FOR SCHOOL LIBRARIES IS DISCUSSED.
4578|DANISH SCHOOL LIBRARY ASSOCIATION ANNUAL MEETING 1981|.     REPORT OF A PAPER GIVEN AT THE 1981| ANNUAL MEETING OF DENMARK'S SCHOOL LIBRARYASSOCIATION BY LISE OSTERGAARD. THE CONTROVERSY OVER THE TRANSFER OFRESPONSIBILITY FOR DANISH SCHOOL LIBRARIES TO THE MINISTRY OF EDUCATION FROMTHE MINISTRY OF CULTURE IS REVIEWED. IT IS THE TASK OF THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES,HOWEVER, TO ENSURE THE OPERATION AND DEVELOPMENT OF PUBLIC AND SCHOOLLIBRARIES, SO THAT THEY WORK TOGETHER IN PROMOTING CULTURAL, INFORMATIONAL ANDEDUCATIONAL ACTIVITIES. THE CHANGE IN THE LAW GOVERNING SCHOOL LIBRARIES IS ASTEP FORWARD, STRENGTHENING COOPERATION BETWEEN THE VARIOUS TYPES OF LIBRARYCONTROLLED BY CENTRAL GOVERNMENT AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES. PRODUCTION OF BOOKSFOR CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE IS IMPORTANT AND HAS INCREASED GREATLY INDENMARK OVER THE LAST 10|-20| YEARS, LARGELY DUE TO THE EXPANSION OF CHILDREN'SLIBRARIES. 80|% OF ALL DANISH CHILDREN'S BOOKS ARE PURCHASED BY PUBLIC, SCHOOLAND INSTITUTIONAL LIBRARIES. THE FUT URE OF SUCH BOOKS DEPENDS ON THEWILLINGNESS OF LOCAL AUTHORITIES, IN SPITE OF BUDGETARY PROBLEMS, TO PROVIDEYOUNG PEOPLE WITH A BROAD RANGE OF LITERATURE.
4579|SCHOOL LIBRARIES AND BASIC EDUCATION IN FIRST AND SECOND GRADE SCHOOLS IN THESTATE OF SAO PAULO, BRAZIL.     DISCUSSES THE ROLE OF THE LIBRARY IN ELEMENTARY AND JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOLS ASPRESCRIBED BY BRAZILIAN STATE LEGISLATION, AND SUGGESTS CLOSER INTEGRATION OFSCHOOL AND LIBRARY TASKS. DETAILS ARE GIVEN OF THE STRUCTURE OF SCHOOLORGANISATION, WHICH ASSIGNS THE LIBRARY TO THE CATEGORY OF TECHNICAL SUPPORTFOR TEACHING PROGRAMMES AND DESIGNATES IT AN EXTRA-CURRICULAR ACTIVITY.CRITICISES THIS AS AN INADEQUATE CONCEPTION OF THE LIBRARY'S ROLE, AND ARGUESFOR ACTIVE COLLABORATION IN THE TEACHING PROCESS, AS A BACK-UP MULTI-MEDIARESOURCE CENTRE. EXAMINES THE OFFICIAL FUNCTIONS OF THE LIBRARY, AND SHOWS HOWINSUFFICIENT RESOURCES ARE PROVIDED FOR THE FULFILMENT OF EVEN ITS NOMINALTASKS. IN CONCLUSION A RESTRUCTURING OF THE SCHOOL SYSTEM IS PROPOSED,PERMITTING TOTAL INTEGRATION OF LIBRARY AND TEACHING PROGRAMMES AT ALL LEVELS.
4580|LIBRARIES IN TANDEM. THE COMPLEMENTARY FUNCTIONS OF SCHOOL AND PUBLICLIBRARIES.     DESCRIBES, BRIEFLY, THE FUNCTIONS OF SCHOOL LIBRARIES, SCHOOL LIBRARY CENTRESAND PUBLIC LIBRARIES AND THEIR INTERACTION AND COOPERATION IN NEW ZEALAND.
4581|THE DEVELOPMENT OF SCHOOL LIBRARIES IN PAPUA NEW GUINEA.     (MLS DISSERTATION.) EXAMINES THE DEVELOPMENT OF SCHOOL LIBRARIES IN PAPUA NEWGUINEA THROUGH A DISCUSSION OF THE GEOGRAPHICAL AND HISTORICAL BACKGROUND, ASTATE OF THE ART REVIEW OF THE CURRENT SCHOOL LIBRARY SITUATION, AND A SUMMARYOF THE EDUCATIONAL AND CULTURAL BACKGROUND. STRESSES THE NEED FOR ARECOGNITION OF THE VALUE OF RESOURCE-BASED EDUCATION, AND SUGGESTS A STRATEGYFOR CHANGE, PROPOSALS FOR A COURSE FOR TEACHER-LIBRARIANS, AND RECOMMENDATIONSFOR SCHOOL LIBRARY STANDARDS.
4582|THE TEACHER AND THE MEDIA CENTRE-PROBLEMS AND DISTURBANCES IN USE.     THE FUNCTIONS AND ORGANISATION OF SCHOOL LIBRARIES/MEDIA CENTRES ASINDISPENSIBLE PREREQUISITES FOR THE REALISATION OF EDUCATIONAL AIMS HAVE BEENDISCUSSED SINCE THE 1970|S, BUT LIBRARIANS' HIGH EXPECTATIONS HAVE GENERALLYNOT BEEN REALISED. EVEN IN COMPREHENSIVE SCHOOLS, MEDIA CENTRES ARE STILL ONLYON THE FRINGE OF SCHOOL LIFE. THE USE OF A MEDIA CENTRE AS A FOCAL POINT OFSCHOOL ACTIVITIES DEMANDS RADICAL CHANGES IN SCHOOL STRUCTURE AND THETEACHER'S ROLE. MANY OF THE MEDIA PROVIDED ARE UNSUITED TO THE SCHOOL LEARNINGSITUATION. TEACHERS HAVE TO SPEND MUCH TIME PLANNING THE DEVELOPMENT OFINDEPENDENT STUDY PROGRAMMES; CLOSE COOPERATION WITH SCHOOL LIBRARIANS WOULDPROVE HELPFUL HERE. ADMINISTRATION OF CENTRALLY STORED MEDIA IS EFFECTIVE ANDECONOMICAL BUT SINCE MUCH TIME IS WASTED WHEN CHILDREN MOVE BETWEEN CLASSROOMAND MEDIA CENTRE, FLEXIBLE TIMETABLES SHOULD BE DEVELOPED.
4583|A DAY IN THE MEDIA CENTRE AT THE BUDENBERG SCHOOL, HAIGER.     THE SCHOOL CATERS FOR ABOUT 90| EDUCATIONALLY SUBNORMAL CHILDREN. THE MEDIACENTRE IS RUN BY TEACHERS WITH AN ASSISTANT ON CIVILIAN SERVICE DUTY; IT ISHOUSED IN A MULTI-PURPOSE ROOM OF ABOUT 300| SQ. M. THE CENTRE OPENS AT 7|.30|A.M. SO THAT CHILDREN CAN USE IT FOR LEISURE AND READING ACTIVITIES UNTILLESSONS START AT 8| A.M. THE CENTRE CONTAINS BOOKS, WITH AN EMPHASIS ONPICTORIAL MATERIAL, RECORDS, VIDEO GAMES AND CASSETTES. PUPILS ARE GIVENINSTRUCTION ON USING THE CENTRE. THE SCHOOL IS THE REGIONAL CENTRE FOR THELOAN OF TEXTBOOK SETS. DANCING AND FILM SESSIONS ARE ALSO HELD IN THE CENTREAND PUPILS CAN COME IN AGAIN FOR LEISURE ACTIVITIES WHEN LESSONS FINISH,BEFORE GOING HOME AT 1| P.M. DURING AFTERNOONS AND EVENINGS THE CENTRE IS USEDFOR CONFERENCES, PARENTS' MEETINGS AND SENIOR CITIZENS' ACTIVITIES.
4584|HAS THE DISCUSSION ABOUT SCHOOL LIBRARIES FINISHED?.     SINCE THE EARLY 19|TH CENTURY, THE VALUE OF A CENTRALLY SITUATED SCHOOL LIBRARYOPEN TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC AND ENCOURAGING A LIFE-LONG LEARNING PROCESS HASBEEN WIDELY DISCUSSED. THE DISCUSSION RECEIVED FRESH IMPETUS AFTER 1970| WITHTHE DEVELOPMENT OF USA, UK AND SCANDINAVIAN SCHOOL MEDIA CENTRES AND RENEWEDINTEREST IN THE SOCIAL AND EDUCATIONAL FUNCTIONS OF SCHOOL LIBRARIES.CLASSROOMS MUST BE CLOSELY CONNECTED WITH THE SCHOOL MEDIA CENTRE; THEIREVOLUTION INTO CLASS MEDIA CENTRES HAS ONLY OCCURRED SO FAR IN PRIMARYSCHOOLS, A CHANGE DEMANDING GOOD ORGANISATION AND CLOSE LINKS WITH THE PUBLICLIBRARY SYSTEM. THE TRIANGULAR RELATIONSHIP CLASSROOM-SCHOOL MEDIACENTRE-PUBLIC LIBRARY CAN BE EQUATED WITH EMUNDS' '3|-TIER' LIBRARY SYSTEM;EACH COMPONENT MUST HAVE ITS TASKS CLEARLY DEFINED.
4585|THE EVOLVEMENT OF SCHOOL LIBRARY RESOURCE CENTRES IN KENYA.     (MA DISSERTATION.) AIMS TO HELP THE KENYAN EDUCATIONAL AUTHORITIES AND OTHERSTO UNDERSTAND THE VALUE OF A SCHOOL LIBRARY RESOURCE CENTRE IN THE EDUCATIONALPROCESS AND IN THE SCHOOL PROGRAMME, AND THUS EMBARK ON A PLAN TO DEFINE ITSOBJECTIVES AND UNDERTAKE A PROGRAMME OF CONSTRUCTION FOR THEIR REALISATION.
4586|LIBRARY WORK WITH HANDICAPPED CHILDREN IN A BRANCH LIBRARY.     THE LIBRARIAN AT A BRANCH LIBRARY IN POTSDAM WORKS CLOSELY WITH TEACHERS ATTHE SPECIAL SCHOOL NEARBY, DISCUSSING SUITABLE LIBRARY MATERIAL AND ARRANGINGSPECIAL EVENTS SUCH AS AUTHORS' VISITS. CHILDREN FROM THE LOWER FORMS AREBROUGHT INTO THE LIBRARY TO SAMPLE THE BOOKS AND LEARN ABOUT THE LIBRARYSERVICE; THE CHILDREN ENJOY THEIR VISITS AND OFTEN RETURN AGAIN DURING LEISUREHOURS. STOCKS MOST USEFUL TO THEM ARE LARGE PRINT BOOKS AND PICTORIALMATERIAL. THE LIBRARIAN HAS ACQUIRED A GOOD KNOWLEDGE OF INDIVIDUAL READERSAND THEIR INTERESTS. THROUGH CLOSE COOPERATION WITH OTHER LIBRARIES,HANDICAPPED READERS FROM OTHER AREAS OFTEN COME TO USE THIS LIBRARY. GOODCONTACTS WITH PARENTS ARE ALSO VALUABLE; A MEETING IS PLANNED TO INTRODUCEPARENTS TO LITERATURE ON DIFFERENT KINDS OF HANDICAP.
4587|THE AFRICAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION OF SOUTH AFRICA-ITS ROLE ON THE BLACK LIBRARYSCENE.     THE AFRICAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION OF SOUTH AFRICA HAS BEEN IN EXISTENCE FOR 17|YEARS. DURING THIS PERIOD IT HAS CONCERNED ITSELF WITH THE PROMOTION OF THEREADING HABIT AMONG BLACKS AND WITH THE UPGRADING OF THE QUALITY OF PERSONSENGAGED IN LIBRARY WORK BY MEANS OF VACATION SCHOOLS AND SEMINARS. IT HAS MADEREPRESENTATIONS TO LOCAL AUTHORITIES AND THE GOVERNMENT AND ALL THOSECONCERNED WITH THE PROVISION OF LIBRARY SERVICES FOR BLACKS, EITHER TO STARTLIBRARY SERVICES WHERE THESE WERE NOT IN EXISTENCE OR TO IMPROVE THE EXISTINGONES FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE LOCAL INHABITANTS.
4588|PUBLIC LIBRARY NEEDS FOR BLACKS' A PERSONAL VIEW.     IN SOUTH AFRICA IT OFTEN IS ALLEGED THAT BLACKS REQUIRE THE PUBLIC LIBRARY TOOFFER SERVICES BY WHICH THEY CAN ADVANCE THEIR KNOWLEDGE AND CAPABILITIES. ONTHE MASLOW PYRAMID THIS COULD BE CONSIDERED A NEED AT THE BASIC LEVEL, WHILETHE READING OF RECREATIVE WORKS COULD BE CONSIDERED TO LIE AT A HIGHER LEVEL.IN FACT IT IS FOUND THAT 72|% OF BOOKS BORROWED BY BLACKS CONSIST OF FICTION.IT MAY NOW BE QUESTIONED WHETHER THE BLACK COMMUNITY HAS ALREADY PASSED THEBASIC READING LEVEL, OR WHETHER RECREATIONAL READING FORMS PART OF THAT LEVEL.AS SOME 66|% OF THE BLACK MEMBERSHIP OF A LIBRARY MAY CONSIST OF CHILDREN, THEHIGH PERCENTAGE OF FICTION CIRCULATED RAISES DOUBTS ABOUT WHETHER THESECHILDREN SEE LIBRARIES PRIMARILY AS SOURCES OF INFORMATION, AND ABOUT THESUITABILITY OF NON-FICTION PROVIDED. ONLY ABOUT 5|% OF BLACKS USE AVAILABLELIBRARY FACILITIES. IT SHOULD BE INVESTIGATED WHETHER THE EDUCATIONAL APPROACHIS NOT BEING OVER-STRESSED IN BLACK PUBLIC LIBRARIES.
4589|ASPECTS CONCERNING THE PROGRESS IN THE USE OF THE SOURCES OF INFORMATION (INENGLISH AND RUMANIAN).     PRESENTS CONCLUSIONS FROM A STUDY OF USERS' INFORMATION HABITS CONCERNING THEDEGREE OF USE OF SOME TYPES OF INFORMATION SOURCE IN 3| STAGES' THEDISCIPLINE-ORIENTED; THE GOAL ORIENTED; AND THE PROBLEM-ORIENTED. THECHARACTERISTIC FEATURE OF THE STAGES IS THE PROCESS OF GRADUAL UNDERSTANDINGOF INFORMATION WHICH MODIFIES THE INFORMATION SEEKING PATTERNS OF THE USERS.SOME RECOMMENDATIONS ARE MADE CONCERNING THE APPROACH OF SECONDARY INFORMATIONSOURCES TO THE CONCRETE INFORMATION REQUIREMENTS OF USERS CONFRONTED WITHPRACTICAL PROBLEMS.
4590|USER FLUCTUATION AS THE TOTALITY OF USER MOVEMENT.     STATISTICS PRODUCED BY KOPENICK DISTRICT LIBRARY IN BERLIN BETWEEN 1969|-79|SHOW THAT EACH YEAR A CONSIDERABLE NUMBER OF NEW USERS ARE REGISTERED ALTHOUGHTHE TOTAL NUMBER OF READERS GROWS ONLY SLOWLY. THESE FIGURES REFLECT NATIONALTRENDS. THE USE OF THE TERM FLUCTUATION IN THIS CONTEXT IS DISCUSSED. USERSMAY LEAVE A LIBRARY FOR VARIOUS REASONS' UNAVOIDABLY, THROUGH ILLNESS ORDEATH; FROM SOCIAL NECESSITY, AS WHEN TRANSFERRING FROM THE CHILDREN'S TO THEADULT LIBRARY; FOR SOCIALLY ACCEPTABLE REASONS, E.G. MOVING HOUSE, MILITARYSERVICE; UNDESIRABLY, BECAUSE THEY FIND THE LIBRARY SERVICE UNSATISFACTORY.ANALYSIS OF ALL AVAILABLE STATISTICS SHOWS THAT 2|/3| OF THE KOPENICK RESIDENTSDO NOT USE THE LIBRARY AT ALL, WHICH AGAIN REFLECTS A NATIONAL TREND.
4591|USER STUDIES' A REVIEW OF IDEAS.     BRAZILIAN LIBRARY SCHOOL COURSE WORK PREPARED IN 1979|, BASED ON A REVIEW OFTHE LITERATURE. RECENT STUDIES HAVE TENDED TO ADOPT A SOCIOLOGICAL APPROACH'THE MOST COMMONLY USED SURVEY TECHNIQUES ARE OUTLINED, AND THEIR LIMITATIONSCRITICISED. SIGNIFICANT RESULTS OF STUDIES OF USERS OF SCIENTIFIC ANDTECHNICAL INFORMATION ARE SUMMARISED, TO ESTABLISH A BASIS FOR DISCUSSING HOWUSERS INTERACT WITH INFORMATION SYSTEMS. THE CHIEF FACTORS DETERMINING USERBEHAVIOUR ARE ISOLATED, AND THE NEED FOR FURTHER RESEARCH EMPHASISED.CONSIDERS THE SITUATION IN BRAZIL WITH SPECIFIC REFERENCE TO PUBLIC LIBRARIES,AN AREA HITHERTO VIRTUALLY UNRESEARCHED. THE IMPORTANCE OF KNOWING MORE ABOUTPOTENTIAL USERS HERE IS OF PRIMARY IMPORTANCE.
4592|THE MEETING OF READING RESEARCH SPECIALISTS.     REPORTS ON THE PROCEEDINGS OF THE 4|TH MEETING OF READING RESEARCH SPECIALISTSFROM EASTERN EUROPE, USSR AND CUBA THAT TOOK PLACE IN BERLIN 18|-21| NOV 80|. THEASPECTS OF READING RESEARCH DISCUSSED INCLUDED' METHODOLOGY OF COMPARATIVEREADING ANALYSIS, DYNAMICS OF READING AND READING REQUESTS IN PUBLICLIBRARIES, THEORY OF EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION WITH REGARD TO RESEARCH RESULTSAND INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION, THE SCIENCE OF READING AND ITS HISTORY,READER-LIBRARIAN RELATIONSHIP, PRINCIPLES OF THE STUDY OF READING AND THE USEOF LIBRARIES, WORK WITH YOUNG READERS IN LIBRARIES AND THE STUDY OF READERS'INTERESTS. OTHER PAPERS REPORTED ON THE STATE OF THE ART OF READING INPARTICULAR LOCATIONS, BOTH NATIONAL AND LOCAL.
4593|THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF WALTER HOFMANN AND RUDOLF ANGERMANN TOWARDS THEDEVELOPMENT OF USER RESEARCH METHODS, PART I.     HOFMANN AND ANGERMANN CARRIED OUT THEIR RESEARCH AT THE BEGINNING OF THISCENTURY, DURING THE PERIOD OF THE MOVEMENT FOR POPULAR EDUCATION. THEY FELTTHAT LIBRARY STAFF SHOULD KNOW ABOUT EACH READER'S REQUIREMENTS FROM ANDMOTIVATION TOWARDS READING SO THAT THE LIBRARY COULD PERFORM EFFECTIVELY ITSEDUCATIVE FUNCTION. HOFMANN ADVOCATED THE IMPORTANCE OF PERSONAL CONTACTBETWEEN STAFF AND READERS AND OF TYPOLOGICAL GROUPING OF READERS WITH THE AIDOF LOAN FREQUENCY STATISTICS. HIS NEW CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM FOR SUBJECTINDEXES WAS USED IN COMPILING CATALOGUES OF THE LEIPZIG BUCHERHALLE. HOFMANNALSO FAVOURED THE USE OF SELECTIVE INDEXES AIMED AT TARGET GROUPS IN ADDITIONTO THAT OF GENERAL CATALOGUES.
4594|THE USE OF PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN QUEBEC IN RELATION TO CERTAIN INBUILT VARIABLES.     REPORT OF A STUDY CARRIED OUT AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MONTREAL IN 1980|-81|, TOINVESTIGATE UNDER-USAGE, AND THE EFFECTS OF SUCH ELEMENTS IN THE INTERNALSYSTEM OF LIBRARY ORGANISATION AND OPERATION AS THE NUMBER OF DOCUMENTSAVAILABLE, STAFFING ARRANGEMENTS, AND HOURS OF OPENING. DATA WERE COLLECTEDFROM A SAMPLE OF THE TOTAL POPULATION OF POTENTIAL USERS BY INTERVIEW ANDQUESTIONNAIRE, AND ANALYSED MANUALLY. DETAILS ARE GIVEN OF CALCULATIONS TOESTABLISH THE RATE OF UNDER-USE, AND THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE EFFECT OF THEVARIABLES TESTED. FINDINGS SHOWED HOURS OF OPENING TO HAVE THE GREATESTINFLUENCE ON USE. CONCLUDES THAT ULTIMATELY THE LEVEL OF STAFFING IS CRUCIALIN PROMOTING LIBRARY USE, AND RECOMMENDS THAT GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS ONLIBRARY PERSONNEL TAKE THIS INTO ACCOUNT.
4595|LIBRARIES AND DOCUMENTATION CENTRES IN SECONDARY TEACHING. RESULTS OF RECENTAMERICAN AND CANADIAN RESEARCH.     EXTRACT FROM A PROJECT FOR A THESIS IN EDUCATION SCIENCES PREPARED FOR THEUNIVERSITY OF MONTREAL. AMERICAN THESES FROM 1976|-77| TO 1980|-81| ON SECONDARYSCHOOL LIBRARIES HAVE FOCUSSED ON THE TOPICS OF MEDIA PROGRAMMES, PERSONNEL,AND USE, WHEREAS IN QUEBEC INTEREST HAS BEEN CONCENTRATED CHIEFLY ON USE. THERESULTS OF RESEARCH ON USE ARE SUMMARISED, AND THE SITUATION IN THE USA INGENERAL COMPARED WITH QUEBEC. QUEBEC SHOWS LITTLE CHANGE, AND IS FAR FROMMOVING TOWARDS THE AMERICAN CONCEPTION OF THE LIBRARY AS CENTRAL TO ALLTEACHING. FURTHER RESEARCH IS PROPOSED TO ESTABLISH THE REASONS FOR THISDEVELOPING CRISIS.
4596|THE CONTRIBUTION OF THE UNIVERSITY LIBRARY TOWARDS THE EDUCATION AND TRAININGOF STUDENTS.     THE RESULTS ARE PRESENTED OF A PILOT SURVEY CARRIED OUT AT THE HUMBOLDTUNIVERSITY IN BERLIN. THE 60| STUDENTS INTERVIEWED STRESSED THAT PERSONALCONTACT BETWEEN LECTURER AND STUDENT WAS THE MOST IMPORTANT AID TO EDUCATION,WHEN ADVICE ON READING AND WORK METHODS COULD BE GIVEN; THEY ALSO VALUEDREADING SUGGESTIONS FROM OTHER STUDENTS. AT LEAST 1|/2| THE STUDENTS INTERVIEWEDFOUND THE LIBRARY STAFF HELPFUL IN PROVIDING GUIDANCE ON LITERATURE STUDY. THELIBRARY WAS A GOOD PLACE FOR WORKING, ALTHOUGH DELAYS IN OBTAINING BOOKSSOMETIMES HELD UP THE STUDY PROGRAMME. SOME STUDENTS FELT THAT CONCENTRATIONON EXAMINATIONS IMPEDED THE GROWTH OF CREATIVE ABILITY. CLOSE CONTACT BETWEENLECTURERS AND LIBRARIANS IS ESSENTIAL FOR THE IMPROVEMENT OF STOCKS AND STUDYMETHODS.
4597|THE PRINCIPLE OF ECONOMIC EFFICIENCY IN ORGANISATION OF THE HIGHER EDUCATIONLIBRARIES AND IN THEIR SPECIALISED INFORMATION ACTIVITY (IN ENGLISH ANDRUMANIAN).     THE PROMPT SUPPLY OF SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION REQUIRED BY EDUCATION, RESEARCHAND PRODUCTION, AND REDUCTION OF RESEARCH TIME ARE THE ULTIMATE AIMS OF HIGHEREDUCATION LIBRARIES. PROPOSES THE REDUCTION OF 'DEAD TIME' IN SCIENTIFICRESEARCH BY' IMPROVEMENT OF THE READING CONDITIONS BY PROMPT SERVING OF THEREADER; KEEPING SPECIALISED STOCK IN SPECIALISED LIBRARIES; SHORTENING TIMEDEVOTED TO BIBLIOGRAPHY DEVELOPMENT. SUGGESTS THE MOST APPROPRIATE MEANS OFOBTAINING MAXIMUM EFFICIENCY IN MINIMUM TIME AND WITH MINIMUM EFFORT.
4598|WHAT ABOUT THE NON-USERS OF THE PUBLIC LIBRARY?.     THE CONTROVERSY CONCERNING THE RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF THE PUBLIC LIBRARY OFTHE USER 2|VERSUS1| THE NON-USER OF THE LIBRARY SERVICE IS CONSIDERED. THEIMPLICATION IS THAT THE LIBRARY CAN BE EFFECTIVE ONLY IF IT APPLIES ITSRESOURCES TOWARDS MEETING THE CULTURAL NEEDS OF THE WHOLE COMMUNITY. SOUTHAFRICA IN THE MAIN LACKS RESEARCH ON COMMUNITY NEEDS RELEVANT TO LIBRARYSERVICES. RESEARCH ON THE NON-USER IN THE UK, THE USA AND SOUTH AFRICA ISBRIEFLY REVIEWED. THE LIBRARY SHOULD MEET CULTURAL NEEDS FROM THE VIEWPOINT OFTHE USER AND NOT OF THE LIBRARIAN. THIS MAKES THE PUBLIC LIBRARY THE MOSTCOMPLEX OF ALL LIBRARY TYPES BECAUSE OF ITS DIVERSE USER TYPES. AN EXAMPLE ISGIVEN OF HOW THE CAPE TOWN CITY LIBRARIES CHANGED ITS POLICY IN SELECTINGCHILDREN'S BOOKS TO SATISFY ITS USERS' NEEDS MORE ADEQUATELY.
4599|THE PROPORTION OF READERS IN THE ELDERLY POPULATION OF QUEBEC AND OF CANADA.     PRESENTS STATISTICAL DATA COMPARING QUEBEC WITH CANADA AS A WHOLE, ON THEPROPORTION OF READERS IN THE ADULT POPULATION; AND ON THE PROPORTION OFREADERS OF VARIOUS TYPES OF MATERIAL IN THE ELDERLY (OVER 65|) POPULATION. THEPOSITION OF THE ELDERLY POPULATION IS THEN COMPARED WITH THAT OF THE TOTALADULT POPULATION, AND IN CONCLUSION DISCUSSES THE PROBABILITY THAT THE NUMBEROF ELDERLY READERS, AND PUBLIC LIBRARY USERS, WILL INCREASE, NECESSITATINGEXPANSION OF LIBRARY FACILITIES TO MEET THEIR DEMANDS.
4600|UTILIZATION OF SOME INFORMATION SOURCES BY STUDENTS IN TERMS OF THE PURPOSEFOR WHICH THE INFORMATION IS USED.     STUDY OF THE INFORMATION SOURCES USED BY STUDENTS, IN RELATION TO THEIRINFORMATION NEEDS. FOR COURSE MATERIAL THEY USE HANDBOOKS, TEXTS ANDSTANDARDS, BUT FOR STUDY OF NEW DEVELOPMENTS THEY USE JOURNAL ARTICLES. OTHERRESULTS ARE PRESENTED, AND CONCLUSIONS DRAWN FOR THE ORGANISATION OF LIBRARYAND INFORMATION CENTRES IN THE HIGHER EDUCATION FIELD.
4601|THE INDIVIDUAL AND COLLECTIVE READER.     THE RUSSIAN PEOPLE EVINCE A GROWING DEMAND FOR BOOKS. BUT WHERE WILL THE PAPERFOR MULTI-MILLION EDITIONS COME FROM? TRANSITION TO AN URBAN LIFE STYLE HASLED TO A GREATER DEMAND FOR BOOKS. MANY, WHO ARE NEW TO BOOK CULTURE, CONSIDERBOOKS AS PROUD POSSESSIONS, NOT FOR USE. THE DEMAND FOR BOOKS IS BEGINNING TORESEMBLE THAT FOR THE MASS MEDIA. BESTSELLERS EXACERBATE LIBRARIES' PROBLEMSITUATION. BESTSELLER TEXTS SHOULD IN FUTURE BE TRANSLATED TO ANOTHERINFORMATION CARRIER AND BE DISSEMINATED BY LIBRARIES OR THE TRADE. HOMES ANDLIBRARIES WILL STILL NEED THOSE BOOKS THAT ARE INTENDED FOR THE INDIVIDUALREADER.
4602|INVESTIGATION OF EFFICIENCY WITH FEEDBACK CARDS.     IN ORDER THAT AN INFORMATION SYSTEM SHOULD COMPLY WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OFRELEVANCE, PERTINENCE, CURRENCY AND OFFER COMPLETE INFORMATION, CONSTANTCONTROL AND ASSESSMENT REPORTS FROM USERS ARE NEEDED. THIS CAN BE ACHIEVED BYTHE ESTABLISHMENT OF FEEDBACK. NOWADAYS, IN THE FIELD OF MANUAL SERVICES THESIGNIFICANCE OF FEEDBACK IS GROWING. AFTER DESCRIBING SOME METHODS OF FEEDBACKAND FEEDBACK CARDS, INTRODUCES A SUBJECT FIELD OBSERVING SERVICE OFFERINGBIBLIOGRAPHIC DATA WHICH IS CARRIED OUT BY THE HUNGARIAN MEDICAL INFORMATIONINSTITUTE AND LIBRARY. DESCRIBES AN EXPERIMENT TO FIND OUT, WITH THE HELP OFFEEDBACK CARDS, THE SUBSCRIBERS' OPINION ON SERVICES.
4603|WHAT CAN THE PUBLIC LIBRARY DO TO INCREASE LITERACY?.     THE PUBLIC LIBRARY IS TRADITIONALLY REGARDED AS A RESOURCE FOR CULTURALLYADVANCED AND LITERATE PEOPLE. SOUTH AFRICA HAS BOTH DEVELOPED AND DEVELOPINGCOMMUNITIES. WHILE THE PUBLIC LIBRARY USUALLY FOCUSES ON THE NEEDS OFESTABLISHED READERS, THERE IS A SUBSTANTIAL CASE FOR PROVIDING INNOVATIVEFORMS OF SERVICE TO ILLITERATE AND NEO-LITERATE COMMUNITIES, AND FOR ACTUALLYPROMOTING LITERACY THROUGH THE LIBRARY. THE CONCEPT OF LITERACY IS DISCUSSEDIN TERMS OF THE DEVELOPED AND DEVELOPING SECTORS, AND LITERACY IS PLACED INITS CULTURAL CONTEXT.

4662|PLANNING SCHOOL LIBRARIES.     A SCHOOL LIBRARY IS A LIBRARY FIRST AND FOREMOST AND MUST ALLOW THE SMOOTHPROCEDURE OF BIBLIOGRAPHIC WORK IN AN ATTRACTIVE SETTING SUITED TO USERS'NEEDS. A MAJOR PROBLEM IN OLDER SCHOOL BUILDINGS IS THE LOCATION OF ACENTRALLY SITUATED ROOM OF SUITABLE SIZE. CAREFUL PRELIMINARY PLANNING BYADMINISTRATORS, TEACHERS, LIBRARY AUTHORITIES, SCHOOL LIBRARIANS AND THEARCHITECT IS ESSENTIAL; THEY MUST ESTABLISH THE LIBRARY'S ROLE IN THE SCHOOL,TEACHERS' REQUIREMENTS AND WHETHER THE GENERAL PUBLIC WILL USE THE LIBRARY.QUESTIONS TO BE CONSIDERED INCLUDE BUILDING MATERIALS, FURNITURE, LIGHTING,FLOORING AND COLOUR SCHEMES. THEN THE ARCHITECT CAN PREPARE PLANS FOR WHICH,AFTER FURTHER DISCUSSION, ESTIMATES CAN BE MADE.

PAPER PRESENTED AT THE 1|ST AUSTRIAN-SOVIET SEMINAR ON THE ROLE OF LIBRARIES INA COUNTRY'S SOCIO-ECONOMIC AND CULTURAL LIFE, HELD AT THE LENIN STATE LIBRARY,20|-22| MAR 79|. THE REFORM OF AUSTRIAN RESEARCH LIBRARIES STARTED WITH THEESTABLISHMENT IN 1970| OF THE FEDERAL MINISTRY OF SCIENCE AND RESEARCH UNDERWHOSE JURISDICTION NOW BELONGS 60|% OF RESEARCH LIBRARIES. THE CENTRALISATIONHAS PROVED BENEFICIAL FOR LIBRARY DEVELOPMENT PLANNING. IN 1975| THE LAW ONUNIVERSITY ORGANISATIONAL STRUCTURE WAS PASSED RESULTING IN THE REORGANISATIONOF ACADEMIC LIBRARIES WITH THE AIM OF BUILDING A COORDINATED AND INTEGRATEDLIBRARY SYSTEM BASED ON UNIFIED PRINCIPLES. ORGANISATIONAL STRUCTURE,FUNCTIONS AND POLICIES OF THE SYSTEM ARE DISCUSSED IN DETAIL. CONCLUDES WITH AREVIEW OF OTHER LAWS RELATED TO LIBRARY DEVELOPMENT.
4665|LOCAL LIBRARY PERIODICALS.     COOPERATION AND COORDINATION FOR THE IMPROVEMENT OF LITERATURE SUPPLY ARE THEESSENTIAL ASPECTS OF THE LOCAL LIBRARY SYSTEMS WHICH WERE SET UP IN THEINDIVIDUAL LIBRARIES IN THE WAKE OF THE UNIVERSITY REFORM. HOWEVER, THE NEWSTRUCTURES REQUIRE A DEGREE OF CURRENT AND CONTINUOUS EXCHANGE OF INFORMATIONBETWEEN THE VARIOUS PARTS OF LIBRARY SYSTEMS. LOCAL LIBRARY JOURNALS CANCONTRIBUTE CONSIDERABLY TO COMMUNICATION ON THE PREMISES. THEY MAKE THELIBRARY SYSTEMS INTELLIGIBLE AND THEY SERVE CONTINUING EDUCATION ANDSTRENGTHEN THE CONTACTS BETWEEN LIBRARIES. AS THEY PROMOTE COOPERATION BY THEINTERLOCKING AND SUPPLY OF ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESSES, THEY PROVIDE FURTHERRATIONALE FOR COOPERATION IN LOCAL LIBRARY SYSTEMS.

NETWORKING HAS RESULTED IN INCREASEDSERVICES TO LIBRARY USERS AND IN INCREASED EFFICIENCIES IN LIBRARY OPERATIONS.IT HAS ALSO INTRODUCED A WHOLE SET OF NEW PROBLEMS THAT MUST BE DISCUSSED INTHE FORUM PROVIDED AS A RESULT OF THE COOPERATIVE ARRANGEMENTS AND THE NEED TOEXTEND THEM INTO THE FUTURE.
4671|THE PLACE OF THE NATIONAL LIBRARY IN THE SWEDISH LIBRARY AND INFORMATIONSYSTEM.     PAPER PRESENTED AT THE 1|ST SWEDISH-SOVIET SEMINAR ON 'THE NATIONAL LIBRARYWITHIN A COUNTY'S LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SERVICES' DEVELOPMENT PROSPECTS'HELD IN MOSCOW, 21|-22| NOV 78|.

67| MILLION FOR THE CONSTRUCTIONOF A NEW LIBRARY. THE BUILDING WHICH IS DUE FOR COMPLETION IN 1974| WILL HOUSETHE COMBINED PROVINCIAL AND CITY LIBRARIES TOGETHER WITH THE ZEELAND CENTRALMUSIC LIBRARY. LACK OF SPACE IN THE PRESENT LIBRARY BUILDINGS AND THE NEED FORCLOSER COOPERATION BETWEEN THE PROVINCIAL AND CITY LIBRARIES LED TO THEDECISION TO COMBINE THEIR SERVICES.

CONSIDERS THEIRACTUAL STATE AT PRESENT' HOUSED IN SUBSTANDARD BUILDINGS, UNDER-RESOURCED,STAFFED BY UNTRAINED PERSONNEL, AND USED MAINLY BY STUDENTS. THE IMPORTEDMODEL OF THE PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVING THE NEEDS OF ALL THE COMMUNITY ISINAPPROPRIATE TO THE SOCIAL REALITY IN BRAZIL, WHERE SOCIAL STRUCTURE IS BASEDON CLASS DIVISION. STATISTICS ARE PRESENTED TO SHOW THE EXTENT OF POTENTIALDEMAND, BUT DESPITE RECENT EXPANSION OF SERVICES, AND THE GROWTH OFPUBLISHING, THE POPULATION OF NON-USERS REMAINS CONSTANT, AND READINGCONTINUES TO BE AN ELITE LEISURE ACTIVITY. THE INITIATION OF A CULTURAL POLICYTO BREAK THE CHAINS OF SOCIAL DEPENDENCE AND DEVELOP PLANS FOR SOCIETY AS AWHOLE IS ADVOCATED.
4675|THE STRUGGLE FOR FULL IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PUBLIC LIBRARIES LAW-1975| (INHEBREW).     WHEN THE LAW WAS PASSED, IT WAS GENERALLY UNDERSTOOD THAT THE GOVERNMENT WOULDFINANCE 75|% OF PUBLIC LIBRARY BUDGETS. THE SITUATION OVER THE PAST SEVERALYEARS HAS BEEN THAT AN EVER-GROWING PERCENTAGE OF THE BUDGET IS COVERED BYLOCAL AUTHORITIES. THIS HAS NOT ONLY BROUGHT ABOUT A DETERIORATION OF PUBLICLIBRARY SERVICES, BUT MAY LEAD TO A SITUATION IN WHICH THE LIBRARIES SECTIONOF THE MINISTRY OF EDUCATION AND CULTURE WILL BE UNABLE TO ENFORCE THE HIGHSTANDARDS IT HAS SET, SINCE IT WILL NOT HAVE THE NECESSARY FUNDS TO PASS ON TOLOCAL AUTHORITIES. DOCUMENTS THE ACTIONS AND EFFORTS OF THE COMMITTEE ON THEFULL IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PUBLIC LIBRARIES LAW SINCE ITS FORMATION IN JUNE78|. THESE INCLUDE CORRESPONDENCE AND MEETINGS WITH SENIOR GOVERNMENT ANDPARLIAMENTARY OFFICIALS AND A PUBLIC EFFORT TO ACHIEVE IMPLEMENTATION, THEHEIGHT OF WHICH WAS A NATIONAL LIBRARIANS' DEMONSTRATION BEFORE THE MINISTRYOF E DUCATION AND CULTURE IN JERUSALEM IN JAN 80|.
4676|ARCHIVAL LEGISLATION 1970|-1980|.     REVIEWS THE LEGISLATIVE DEVELOPMENTS RELATING TO ARCHIVES IN 58| COUNTRIESDURING THE PERIOD 1970|-80|.

DISCUSSES POLITICIANS' EXPECTATIONS OF THELIBRARY AND ITS STAFF. COOPERATION BETWEEN LOCAL POLITICIANS AND LIBRARIANS ISOFTEN HAMPERED BY THE LIBRARIANS' PREFERENCE FOR CENTRALLY IMPOSED NORMSINSTEAD OF ADAPTATION TO LOCAL NEEDS. BUT IMPOSITION OF OBLIGATIONS TAKES AWAYSPONTANEITY. OBJECTS TO SELF-APPOINTED MORALISTS GUIDING THE PEOPLE'S CULTURALNEEDS IN A CERTAIN IDEOLOGICAL DIRECTION. COMPREHENSIVENESS, ONE OF THELIBRARY OBJECTIVES, CANNOT BE ON THE BASIS OF A PARTICULAR BOOK, WHICH MUSTNECESSARILY PRESENT A PARTICULAR VIEWPOINT, BUT MUST BE AN OVERALL GUIDELINE.THE LIBRARY LAW, LIKE MODERN EDUCATION AND SOCIAL LAWS, SHOULD SPECIFY ANOBLIGATION TO DEVELOPMENT PLANNING IN THE INDIVIDUAL AUTHORITY, NOT LAY DOWNEXTERNAL STRUCTURAL NORMS WITHOUT REGARD TO LOCAL CONDITIONS. THE LEADINGLIBRARIAN AND THE LEADING HEAD TEACHER MUST HAVE EQUAL  SAY ON THE CULTURALCOMMITTEE TO SECURE LIBRARIES' INDEPENDENCE FROM AN ADMINISTRATIVE LEADER FROMTHE EDUCATION SERVICE. LIBRARIES MUST NOURISH THE QUALIFIED DOUBT AND SUPPLYTHE MEANS FOR CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM OF EXPERT KNOWLEDGE NECESSARY IN THEDEMOCRATIC DECISION MAKING PROCESS. LIBRARIES AND LOCAL POLITICIANS MUSTCOOPERATE IN KEEPING ART AND CULTURE INDEPENDENT OF POLITICAL AND COMMERCIALINFLUENCE.
4682|SUBJECT DEPARTMENTS IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES ABROAD' A FEW LESSONS OF ANINTERNATIONAL SURVEY.     THE HUNGARIAN CENTRE FOR LIBRARY SCIENCE AND METHODOLOGY CONDUCTED ANINTERNATIONAL SURVEY BY QUESTIONNAIRE IN 1979|/80| OF 47| SUBJECTDEPARTMENTALISED PUBLIC LIBRARIES. ON THE BASIS OF THE REPLIES RECEIVED, THEFOLLOWING CONCLUSIONS WERE MADE' UNDER 3|,000| SQ.M. BASIC AREA AND 300|,000|VOLUMES IT IS NOT WORTHWHILE ESTABLISHING FULL SUBJECT DEPARTMENTS; MOVING TOA NEW BUILDING GENERALLY ENCOURAGES THE ESTABLISHMENT OF SUBJECT DEPARTMENTS;THE MAJORITY OF LIBRARIES DEVELOP THE NEW STRUCTURE NOT IN 1| STEP BUTGRADUALLY; SUBJECTIVE STANDPOINTS PREVAIL OFTEN IN THE DEMARCATION OF SUBJECTDEPARTMENTS; WHEN SELECTING SPECIAL STAFF THOSE WITH LIBRARY QUALIFICATIONSHAVE THE ADVANTAGE OVER SPECIALISTS WHO ARE NOT LIBRARIANS.
4683|DECISION TABLE' A TOOL OF SYSTEMS STUDY.     DESCRIBES THE PURPOSE AND USE OF DECISION TABLES. DECISION TABLES CAN BEEFFECTIVE INSTRUMENTS FOR COMMUNICATION BETWEEN LIBRARIANS AND COMPUTERPROGRAMMERS. THIS TABULAR APPROACH CAN BE USED NOT ONLY TO EXPRESS THEDECISION LOGIC IN ITS SIMPLEST FORM, BUT CAN ALSO BE OF IMMENSE HELP IN THEANALYSIS OF A DECISION PROBLEM.
4684|THE UNIVERSITY LIBRARY AND SYSTEMS THEORY.     OUTLINES THE BASIC PRINCIPLES OF SYSTEMS THEORY AND APPLIES THEM TO UNIVERSITYLIBRARY ORGANISATION, AS PART OF THE GENERAL UNIVERSITY SUPRA-SYSTEM. ANALYSISCOVERS THE OBJECTIVES OF THE LIBRARY; THE PRODUCTION INPUTS, I.E. BOOKS ANDPERIODICALS; MAINTENANCE, TECHNICAL, SUPPORT AND ADAPTATION SUBSYSTEMS; ANDTHE OUTPUTS, I.E. SERVICES.
4685|MANAGEMENT-BY-OBJECTIVES APPLIED IN A SOUTH AFRICAN INDUSTRIAL LIBRARY.     MANAGEMENT-BY-OBJECTIVES IS SUGGESTED AS A MEANS TO JUSTIFY THE EXISTENCE OFAN INDUSTRIAL LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SERVICE. THE PREREQUISITES ARE THAT THEINDUSTRIAL LIBRARIAN MUST GRASP THE SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER WHICH ASERVICE FUNCTION OPERATES IN INDUSTRY AS WELL AS THE ATTITUDES TOWARDS THESEFUNCTIONS. HE MUST ALSO ACQUAINT HIMSELF WITH THE OBJECTIVES OF THEORGANISATION HE SERVES AND ARRANGE HIS SERVICES TO MAKE A DEFINABLECONTRIBUTION TOWARDS THE ACHIEVEMENT OF THESE ORGANISATIONAL OBJECTIVES. THEOBJECTIVES OF THE DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS MUST BE USED AS PREMISES FORDETERMINING WHERE THE LIBRARY AND INFORMATION FUNCTION SHOULD OPERATE AND HOWITS SERVICES SHOULD BE PRESENTED. THE INFORMATION SERVICE (WHICH CONSISTS OF 3|SECTIONS, A LIBRARY, TRANSLATION BUREAU AND INFORMATION DISSEMINATION) OF THESOUTH AFRICAN IRON AND STEEL INDUSTRIAL CORPORATION (ISCOR) IS USED AS AWORKING EXAMPLE. THE USE OF MBO BY ISC OR IS BRIEFLY DISCUSSED AND THEOBJECTIVES OF ISCOR AND ITS GENERAL MANAGER ARE MENTIONED. FROM THESEOBJECTIVES AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY ARE DERIVED AND IDENTIFIED IN THE FORM OFTHE DIFFERENT ISCOR DEPARTMENTS.
4686|LIBRARIANS AS POLITICAL ACTIVISTS.     DESCRIBES HOW LIBRARIANS AT BERKELEY, CALIFORNIA SUCCEEDED IN ENABLING THEIRLIBRARIES TO MAINTAIN THEIR POSITIONS, OR EVEN GROW, IN SPITE OF THE GENERALSHRINKAGE OF LOCAL BUDGETS IN THE STATE. THIS WAS ACCOMPLISHED BY THEINFLUENCE OF DIRECT POLITICAL ACTION AT THE LOCAL COMMUNITY LEVEL.
4687|GERMAN LIBRARIES' THE FINANCIAL CRISIS AND ITS CONSEQUENCES.     LECTURE GIVEN TO A MEETING OF MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT IN BERLIN. GERMANS AREPROUD OF THEIR RIGHT TO THE FREE EXPRESSION OF OPINION IN SPEECH AND INWRITING, YET THIS VERY FREEDOM CAN CAUSE CONFUSION. SINCE INFORMATION CAN BEUNSCRUPULOUSLY MANIPULATED A RESPONSIBLE ATTITUDE MUST BE MAINTAINED.INTER-LIBRARY COOPERATION FOR STOCK PURCHASE AND LOANS IS ESSENTIAL TO KEEPCOSTS DOWN. LIBRARIES OFTEN RANK LOW IN LISTS OF CULTURAL PRIORITIES OWING TOA LACK OF INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR PROBLEMS AND A LACK OF PUBLIC INTEREST;MARKET ECONOMY CRITERIA CANNOT BE APPLIED TO THEM. THE PROVISION OFINFORMATION AND LITERATURE MUST BE PLANNED RATIONALLY. MANY LIBRARIES HAVE HADTO ACCEPT CUTS IN THEIR BUDGETS ALTHOUGH THE PRICES OF BOOKS AND PERIODICALSHAVE RISEN; COOPERATION BETWEEN LIBRARIES AND THE BOOK TRADE MUST BE IMPROVED.
4688|LIBRARY NEWS.COVE     RS SOME OF THE MAJOR ITEMS OF U.S. NATIONAL NEWS AFFECTING LIBRARY FUNDING ANDSUPPORT DURING 1980|.
4689|THE FINANCING OF THE PUBLIC LIBRARY.     THE DEVELOPMENT OF FINANCING METHODS FOR SOUTH AFRICAN PUBLIC LIBRARIES ISSKETCHED, FROM THE SUBSCRIPTION LIBRARY TO THE PARTNERSHIP SYSTEM IN WHICHCOSTS OF LOCAL LIBRARIES ARE SHARED BETWEEN THE PROVINCIAL LIBRARY SERVICESAND THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES. THE VARIOUS APPROACHES FOLLOWED IN THE 4| SOUTHAFRICAN PROVINCES ARE INDICATED. A GREAT NEED EXISTS FOR FURTHER RESEARCH ONTHE FINANCING OF PUBLIC LIBRARIES. PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN THE LARGE CITIESESPECIALLY ARE SUFFERING BECAUSE OF INADEQUATE FINANCING.
4690|SOME PROMISES KEPT' THE PETERBOROUGH TOWN LIBRARY.     TRACES THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE PUBLIC LIBRARY IN PETERBOROUGH, NEW HAMPSHIRE,THE OLDEST TAX-SUPPORTED LIBRARY IN THE WORLD. DESCRIBES THE FINANCING OF THELIBRARY SINCE ITS FOUNDATION IN 1833|, AND DISCUSSES ITS BUDGET FOR 1981|,APPROXIMATELY 80|% OF WHICH IS ACCOUNTED FOR BY TAX SUPPORT.
4691|ZZZZ.     DESCRIBES THE CAMPAIGN BY PUBLIC LIBRARIANS IN VIRGINIA TO INCREASE STATE AIDWITH THE HELP OF A LOBBYIST. THE GREATEST VICTORY WAS THE CREATION OF A JOINTSUBCOMMITTEE ON THE FUNDING OF LIBRARIES.
4692|THE PRINCIPLE OF THE 'FREE' PUBLIC LIBRARY.     FOR VARIOUS REASONS IT IS BECOMING MORE AND MORE DIFFICULT FOR PUBLICLIBRARIES TO OBTAIN SUFFICIENT FUNDS FROM THEIR AUTHORITIES, IN COMPETITIONWITH OTHER MORE ESSENTIAL SERVICES. FREE PUBLIC LIBRARIES ORIGINATED IN THE UKDURING THE MIDDLE OF THE LAST CENTURY, THEIR MAIN FUNCTION BEING THE UPLIFTINGOF THE UNEDUCATED. TODAY PUBLIC LIBRARIES MAINLY CONCENTRATE ON THE SUPPLYINGOF LIGHT READING MATTER, ESPECIALLY NOVELS, OF WHICH THE MAJORITY ARE, FROM ALITERARY POINT OF VIEW, OF A DUBIOUS NATURE. THE ARGUMENTS USED DURING THELAST CENTURY TO DEFEND THE PRINCIPLE OF FREE SERVICES ARE NO LONGER VALIDTODAY. THE FUNCTIONS OF THE MODERN PUBLIC LIBRARY ARE NEITHER FULLY PART OFTHE WORLD OF EDUCATION NOR THE WORLD OF RECREATION, WITH THE RESULT THAT ITSIMAGE TO THE OUTSIDE WORLD IS OBSCURE. CONSIDERS THAT, ALTHOUGH CONTINUEDFINANCING OF PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVICES BY THE SOUTH AFRICAN GOVERNMENT ISNECESSARY, NO VALID OBJECTION CAN BE FOUND TO CHARG E USERS FOR THOSE SERVICESWHICH ARE NOT ESSENTIAL FOR THE AIMS WHICH THE PUBLIC LIBRARY PURSUES.
4693|CAN LOCAL AUTHORITIES STILL AFFORD FREE PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVICES?.     THE VIEWS THAT VARIOUS MEMBERS OF A SOUTH AFRICAN COMMUNITY MAY HAVE ON THEPROVISION OF A FREE PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVICE BY THE LOCAL AUTHORITY AREEXPLORED. IDENTIFIES 3| GROUPS OF LIBRARY USERS' RATE-PAYER/LIBRARY MEMBERS,RESIDENT NON-RATEPAYERS AND NON-RESIDENT LIBRARY MEMBERS, AND LOOKS AT THEJUSTIFICATION FOR A FREE LIBRARY SERVICE TO EACH GROUP. HE CONCLUDES THAT THE1|ST GROUP IS THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN JUSTIFIABLY BE GIVEN A FREE PUBLIC LIBRARYSERVICE BY A LOCAL AUTHORITY.
4694|A COMPARISON BETWEEN MOBILE AND STATIONARY LIBRARIES IN RURAL AREAS WITHREFERENCE TO COSTS AND PERFORMANCE.     THERE IS STILL DISAGREEMENT OVER WHETHER MOBILE OR STATIONARY LIBRARIESPROVIDE THE BEST SERVICE FOR RURAL AREAS WITH POPULATIONS UNDER 5|,000|. MOBILELIBRARIES PERMIT FLEXIBLE ORGANISATION AND CAN COME CLOSE TO USERS' HOMES;THEY ARE OPERATED BY PROFESSIONAL STAFF WHO BRING A LARGE AND VARIED BOOKSTOCK SUPPLEMENTED BY CENTRAL RESERVES. SINCE THEY ARE ONLY IN 1| PLACE FOR ASHORT TIME, HOWEVER, THEY CANNOT EASILY BECOME CULTURAL CENTRES. SMALLSTATIONARY BRANCH LIBRARIES IN RURAL AREAS HAVE SMALL, RESTRICTED STOCKS ANDARE RARELY SERVED BY PROFESSIONAL STAFF. A COMPARISON OF INITIAL AND RUNNINGCOSTS FOR MOBILE AND SMALL STATIONARY BRANCH LIBRARIES IN MIDDLE FRANCONIAREVEALS THAT MOBILE LIBRARY PROVISION IS THE CHEAPER METHOD AND A COMPARISONOF PERFORMANCES, THAT IT IS THE MORE EFFICIENT.
4695|LIBRARY SERVICE IN GREAT BRITAIN' STANDING FAST.     EXAMINES THE EFFECT ON LIBRARIES IN THE UK OF THE ENFORCEMENT OF LOCALGOVERNMENT SPENDING CUTS. COMPARES THE SITUATION IN TOWER HAMLETS ANDLANCASHIRE, WHERE DRASTIC REDUCTIONS IN LIBRARY SPENDING HAVE TAKEN PLACE,WITH THAT IN CAMDEN, WHERE SPENDING HAS NOT BEEN CUT, BUT WHERE RATEPAYERS AREHAVING TO BEAR AN INCREASING LEVEL OF TAXATION FOR LIBRARIES AND OTHERSERVICES. DESCRIBES HOW PROBLEMS HAVE BEEN OVERCOME IN 2| AUTHORITIES' INSUTTON WHERE REVENUE-RAISING ACTIVITIES SUCH AS VIDEO GAMES HAVE BEENINTRODUCED; AND IN BRENT, WHERE THE COMMUNITY BASED LIBRARY SERVICE, BECAUSEOF ITS MAJOR COMMITMENT TO OUTREACH AND COMMUNITY BASED PROGRAMMES HAS BEENTREATED MORE FAVOURABLY THAN OTHER DEPARTMENTS. NOTES THE RESPONSE OF THEUNIONS AND THE LIBRARY ASSOCIATION TO THE SPENDING CUTS.
4696|THE CULTURAL POLICY OF LOCAL AUTHORITIES.     THE TEXT OF A TALK GIVEN TO A CONFERENCE ON LIBRARIES IN THE ICY WIND OFCULTURAL POLICY, HELD IN JARFALLA, MAY 81|. IN ORDER TO INFLUENCE CULTURALPOLICY THE CULTURAL PRODUCERS MUST INFORM THEMSELVES OF THE WHOLE SPHERE OFLOCAL POLITICS. LOCAL AUTHORITIES HAVE NO LEGAL OBLIGATION TO PROVIDE CULTURALACTIVITIES AND LEGISLATION LAYING DOWN MINIMUM STANDARDS FOR SUCH ACTIVITIES,AS IN FINLAND, SHOULD BE ENACTED. AFTER THE BOOM IN THE 60|S AND 70|S, THE LOCALAUTHORITIES HAVE TO MAKE CUTS; AS THEY CANNOT REDUCE PREVIOUS CAPITALINVESTMENT THEY CUT CURRENT EXPENDITURE ON CULTURAL ACTIVITIES SUCH AS SCHOOLSAND LIBRARIES, ALTHOUGH MONEY SEEMS ALWAYS AVAILABLE FOR SPORT, BUREAUCRACYAND DATA TECHNOLOGY. THE REAL POWER OF DECISION-MAKING LIES NOT WITH THECULTURAL, BUT WITH THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE, WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR BUDGETING.CULTURAL CONSUMERS SHOULD BE AS POLITICALLY ACTIVE AS THE PRESSURE GROUPS FORSPORT AND TRY TO INFLUENCE LOCAL POLITICIANS,  IF A CATASTROPHE FOR CULTURE ISTO BE AVERTED.
4697|ZERO-BASE BUDGETING FOR LIBRARIES' A SECOND LOOK.     ZERO-BASE BUDGETING (ZBB) WAS GIVEN CONSIDERABLE ATTENTION IN THE MANAGEMENTLITERATURE DURING THE LATTER 1970|S. ZBB OFFERS MANY CONCEPTS AND BUDGETINGTECHNIQUES THAT MAY PROVE ESPECIALLY USEFUL TO LIBRARY ADMINISTRATORS IN THEBUDGET-TIGHT 1980|S. INCLUDES A BRIEF REVIEW OF THE KEY FEATURES OF ZBB AS ABUDGETING/PLANNING SYSTEM, A DISCUSSION OF THE APPLICATIONS OF ZBB REPORTED INTHE LITERATURE, AND A SUMMARY OF THE SPECIAL BENEFITS AND PROBLEMS FORLIBRARIES THAT USE OF CONCEPTS DERIVED FROM ZBB, IF NOT ZBB ITSELF, MIGHTPROVIDE.
4698|FUTURE LIBRARIES' THE ELECTRONIC ENVIRONMENT.     ARGUES THAT THE LIBRARY, AND ITS ABILITY TO HANDLE INFORMATION EFFICIENTLYCOULD WELL BE AT THE CENTRE OF CHANGE AS THE NEW ELECTRONIC TECHNOLOGY BEGINSTO HAVE A MAJOR EFFECT ON THE INFORMATION ENVIRONMENT. CONCLUDES THATELECTRONIC TECHNOLOGY HOLDS THE POTENTIAL TO MAKE THE LIBRARY A MOREHUMANISTIC INSTITUTION BY ROUTINISING JOBS FORMERLY DONE BY PROFESSIONALS,THEREBY MAKING THE LIBRARY MORE EFFICIENT AND FREEING THESE PROFESSIONALS TOINTERACT MORE CLOSELY WITH THE USERS OF INFORMATION.
4699|DEVELOPING COMPUTER-BASED LIBRARY SYSTEMS.     AIMS TO PROVIDE PRACTICAL GUIDANCE FOR THE LIBRARIAN, UNTRAINED IN SYSTEMSDEVELOPMENT AND POSSIBLY UNFAMILIAR WITH COMPUTERS, WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FORDEVELOPING A COMPUTER BASED SYSTEM.
4700|AUTOMATION OF LIBRARY-BIBLIOGRAPHICAL PROCESSES ON THE PAGES OF PROFESSIONALPUBLICATIONS IN THE CAPITALIST COUNTRIES.     ACHIEVEMENTS IN LIBRARY AUTOMATION IN WESTERN COUNTRIES ARE REVIEWED ON THEBASIS OF PUBLISHED MATERIALS. ASPECTS COVERED ARE' DEVELOPMENT OF COMPUTERISEDDATA BASES IN LIBRARIES, COMPUTERISED CIRCULATION SYSTEMS, ACQUISITION SYSTEMSAND INTEGRATED SYSTEMS APPLIED IN LIBRARIES IN VARIOUS COUNTRIES.BIBLIOGRAPHICAL PROCESSING IS AN AREA WHERE COMPUTERS HAVE MOST OFTEN BEENUTILISED. SEVERAL SYSTEMS, INCLUDING MARC, AND AUTOMATED INFORMATION RETRIEVALSERVICES AND ON-LINE SYSTEMS ARE MENTIONED. COOPERATION CONNECTED WITH THE USEOF COMPUTERS IN LIBRARIES AND THE RESULTING ECONOMICALLY EFFECTIVE PROCESSINGARE FACTORS OF A GREAT INTEREST TO SOVIET LIBRARIANS.
4701|MARKS OF INSUFFICIENCY: LESSONS OF A MEETING AND OF A THEMATIC ISSUE OF AJOURNAL.     THE PROFESSIONAL MEETING HELD IN AUTUMN 81| IN KECSKEMET AND THE THEMATIC ISSUEOF THE PERIODICAL INFORMACIO/ELEKTRONIKA (16| (5|) 1981|) DEALING WITH LIBRARYMECHANISATION HAVE RAISED A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS CONCERNING HUNGARIANINFORMATION AND DOCUMENTATION. THE PROBLEMS RESULT FROM CHANGES IN THEDESCRIPTION OF DOCUMENTS AND FROM THE DRAWING UP OF CATALOGUES FOLLOWING FROMTHEM. ON THE BASIS OF THEIR EXAMINATION, POINTS TO THE FACTS HINDERINGDEVELOPMENT' FOREIGN RESULTS OF AUTOMATION ARE TAKEN OVER WITH DIFFICULTY;LIBRARY MECHANISATION IS UNCOORDINATED; THE THEORY OF CLASSIFICATION ISUNDEVELOPED AND TERMINOLOGY IS NOT CLEAR.
4702|THE PUBLIC LIBRARY IN THE TECHNOLOGICAL EIGHTIES.     THE HISTORY OF COMPUTERISATION IN THE EAST LONDON PUBLIC LIBRARY (SOUTHAFRICA) IS OUTLINED. AN EVALUATION OF THE CURRENT STATUS SHOWS THAT THE SYSTEMIS DATED IN RELATION TO NEW TECHNOLOGY. A CHANGE TO AN ON-LINE SYSTEM ISFORESEEN. SINCE AACR2| AND SAMARC WERE NOT IN EXISTENCE AT THE TIME OF INITIALCOMPUTERISATION, THE PRESENT SYSTEM IS INCOMPATIBLE WITH THEM-A FACTOR THATWILL AFFECT COOPERATION WITH OTHER LIBRARIES IN A POSSIBLE FUTURE NETWORK. THEPOSSIBLE USE IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES OF COMPUTERS AND OTHER TECHNOLOGICALADVANCES, SUCH AS READING AIDS FOR THE BLIND, IS DISCUSSED AND PUBLICLIBRARIANS ARE URGED TO BE FORWARD-LOOKING AND ENTERPRISING IN ADOPTINGINNOVATIONS.
4703|AUTOMATION IN THE LIBRARY OF THE UNILEVER RESEARCH LABORATORY IN VLAARDINGEN.     THE LIBRARY OF THE UNILEVER RESEARCH LABORATORY AT VLAARDINGEN IN THENETHERLANDS SERVES APPROXIMATELY 450| LABORATORY STAFF.

NEITHER THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS NOR MOST MICROPUBLISHERS FULLYANALYSE THESE COLLECTIONS. INDIVIDUAL LIBRARIES CANNOT AFFORD TO DO SO EITHER.BUT WITHOUT AUTHOR AND TITLE ACCESS, THESE COLLECTIONS ARE NOT VERY USEFUL.FULL ANALYTICS FOR MICROFORM COLLECTIONS HAVE BEEN CALLED FOR BUT NO EFFORTYET HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL. SUGGESTS THAT LIBRARIES ABANDON FULL CATALOGUING INFAVOUR OF INDEXING, USING THE INFORMATION PROVIDED BY MICROPUBLISHERS. WHILE ANATIONAL INDEX TO THE CONTENTS OF MICROFORM COLLECTIONS WOULD BE BEST, ANALTERNATIVE FOR LOCAL LIBRARIES WOULD BE TO CREATE THEIR OWN COM INDEX.

A 6|-MONTH EXPERIMENTAL SDI SERVICE WAS UNDERTAKEN AT THE UNIVERSITY OF NATALLIBRARY, PIETERMARITZBURG SOUTH AFRICA, AS PART OF A PLAN TO MAKE SUBJECTLIBRARIANS MORE SERVICE ORIENTATED, AND IN THE KNOWLEDGE THAT RESEARCH TIMEFOR ACADEMICS WAS AT A PREMIUM. A METHODOLOGY WAS DEVISED AND 21| LECTURERSFROM ACROSS THE ACADEMIC SPECTRUM SUBMITTED 27| PROFILES. REFERENCES WERESUPPLIED FROM JOURNALS AND MONOGRAPHS AND FROM ABSTRACTING TOOLS WHERE THELIBRARY HAD POOR LITERATURE COVERAGE. AT THE END OF THE 6| MONTHS, FEEDBACKREVEALED THAT 93|% OF THE REFERENCES ASSESSED (82|%) WERE RELEVANT OR APPARENTLYRELEVANT, SHOWING THAT BIBLIOGRAPHIC RATHER THAN TERMINOLOGICAL SKILLS WERETHE SALIENT FACTOR. ACADEMIC RESPONSE WAS UNANIMOUSLY IN FAVOUR OF ACONTINUATION OF THE SERVICE, WHILE A FEW RESPONDENTS WANTED MINORIMPROVEMENTS. THE SUBJECT LIBRARIANS FOUND THAT THE SERVICE INCREASED JOBSATISFACTION AND ALLOWED THEM TO LOOK MORE CRITICALLY AT LIBRARY STOCK. INTERMS OF  TIME AND FINANCIAL COST THE SDI SERVICE WAS EASILY ABSORBED INTO THEEXISTING WORK STRUCTURE OF THE LIBRARY. IT WAS FOUND TO BE PARTICULARLYRELEVANT TO INTERDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH, AND IT RELIED UPON A WELL-DEVELOPEDSUBJECT LIBRARIAN STRUCTURE. ITS SUCCESS, HOWEVER, DEPENDED ON AN ACTIVECAMPAIGN BY LIBRARIANS DIRECTED AT POTENTIAL PARTICIPANTS.

THROUGH THE USE OFACTIVE LISTENING, MORE PRECISE COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE PATRON AND REFERENCELIBRARIAN CAN BE ESTABLISHED AND BETTER REFERENCE SERVICE GIVEN.
4816|JOB MOTIVATION AND SATISFACTION OF REFERENCE STAFF IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES.     ARGUES THAT DESPITE AUTOMATION, LIBRARY WORK WILL REMAIN LABOUR INTENSIVE; ITIS THEREFORE ESSENTIAL TO CONSIDER THE HUMAN ASPECT OF THE SITUATION,PARTICULARLY IN REFERENCE WORK, WHERE IN GENERAL THE QUALITY IS LOW. TOINVESTIGATE THE RELATION BETWEEN JOB MOTIVATION AND SATISFACTION, A SURVEY WASCARRIED OUT AMONG ONTARIO REFERENCE LIBRARY STAFF, USING TECHNIQUES OFANALYSIS AND MEASUREMENT ADAPTED FROM THE FIELD OF BUSINESS STUDIES. DETAILSARE GIVEN OF THE METHODOLOGY, QUESTIONNAIRE CONSTRUCTION, AND RATINGTECHNIQUES. RESULTS SHOWED GENERALLY MODERATE SATISFACTION WITH ENVIRONMENTALCONDITIONS, BUT LOW MOTIVATION. THE INITIAL HYPOTHESIS, THAT PROFESSIONALSWOULD EXPRESS GREATER MOTIVATION AND SATISFACTION THAN NON-PROFESSIONALS, WASNOT CONFIRMED.
4817|MISCELLANY. JOSE MARTI NATIONAL LIBRARY.     A REPORT OF ACTIVITIES IN 1980|. AN ACCOUNT IS GIVEN OF 2| EXHIBITIONS OFDOCUMENTARY TREASURES, FROM 1950|-52|, AND FROM 1953|-80|; OUTSTANDING ITEMS AREDESCRIBED IN DETAIL.

LIBRARIANS SHOULD HELP READERS TO APPRECIATEPUSHKIN'S POETRY. THE REGIONAL LIBRARY COULD COMPILE A WORK ON PUSHKIN BASEDON THE MUSEUM'S VISITORS' BOOKS, DATING FROM 1899|. READERS COULD BE ENCOURAGEDTO DESCRIBE HOW THEY DISCOVERED PUSHKIN. PUSHKIN LITERARY EVENINGS SHOULDTREAT ONLY ONE OF HIS WORKS AND ADAPT TO THE AUDIENCE'S AGE GROUP. FOR THESE,LIBRARIANS COULD STUDY VARIANTS OF HIS POEMS, THE SOCIAL LIFE AND POPULARCULTURE OF HIS TIME. THE PUSHKINOGORETS REGIONAL LIBRARY SHOULD BECOME AREPOSITORY OF PUSHKIN AREA LEGENDS. THE MUSEUM STRIVES TO ENCOURAGE A LIVELYPERCEPTION OF HISTORY.
4819|POETRY, COFFEE AND CAKES: POETRY CAFE OSTERGARD.     DESCRIBES THE EFFORTS OF HALMSTAD PUBLIC LIBRARY TO PROMOTE POETRY. SWEDISHPUBLIC LIBRARIES ACQUIRE VERY LITTLE POETRY, AND POETRY EVENINGS ARE ANEXCEPTION. POETRY CAFE OSTERGARD BEGAN IN AUTUMN 80| WITH EVENING GATHERINGSHELD IN HALMSTAD'S BRANCH LIBRARY IN OSTERGARD SCHOOL. THE AIM WAS NOT TOREPLACE HALMSTAD CENTRAL LIBRARY'S AUTHOR EVENINGS, BUT TO COMPLEMENT THEMWITH ACTIVITIES IN A BRANCH LIBRARY. NEW FORMS WERE SOUGHT WHICH INVOLVED THEPARTICIPANTS IN ACTIVE LISTENING AND CONVERSATION. A CAFE ATMOSPHERE WITHCOFFEE AND CAKES WAS CREATED. MANY OF THE POETS LIVED LOCALLY. THE LIBRARYPRINTS POSTERS AND ADVERTISES IN THE LOCAL PRESS AND RADIO PRIOR TO EACHEVENING AND PREPARES FREE FOLDERS WITH POEMS AND INTRODUCTIONS TO THE POETS.EMPHASISES THAT THERE MUST BE CONTINUITY THROUGH REGULAR ACTIVITIES AND THATMORE PERSONAL CONTACT TO PROMOTE THE EVENINGS AND MORE PARTICIPATION BYAMATEUR POETS ARE NEEDED IF THE CAFE IS TO CONT INUE.

4822|THE LITERATURE SEARCH THAT WENT UP IN SMOKE.     SINCE 1977|, THE LIBRARIANS' UNION HAS STRESSED THAT AUTOMATION IN LIBRARIESSHOULD BEGIN WITH BIBLIOGRAPHIC SYSTEMS. BIBLIOTEKSDATA HAS REPLIED THAT THEIRDEVELOPMENT PLANS AGREE WITH THIS PRIORITY, BUT ADDS THAT LOCAL LIBRARIES MUSTBE FREE TO DECIDE WHICH AUTOMATION SYSTEM TO USE. FEARS THAT BIBLIOTEKSDATA,IN EFFECT, IS GIVING PRIORITY TO AUTOMATION OF ADMINISTRATIVE TASKS, SUCH ASISSUES AND ACQUISITIONS, ALTHOUGH THE UNION HAS ARGUED THE NEED FOR TERMINALACCESS FOR LIBRARIES TO THE BIBLIOGRAPHIC DATA BASE. PROVISION OF SUCH ACCESSHAS BEEN HELD UP BY THE FACT THAT THE QUESTION OF THE BEST SUBJECT SEARCHSYSTEM HAS NOT YET BEEN SOLVED. MEANTIME, HOWEVER, ATTEMPTS SHOULD BE MADE TOPROVIDE TERMINAL ACCESS WITH FREE TEXT SEARCHING, SIMILAR SEARCHING ONMICROFORM, AND EXPANSION OF BIBLIOGRAPHIC ENTRIES WITH SUBJECT WORDS. ARGUESTHAT THE LIMITED RESOURCES SHOULD BE CONCENTRATED ON THE MOST IMPORTANT AREA'SERVICES.
4823|BIBLIOTHEKSDATA HAS A PLAN.     A STATEMENTS BY BIBLIOTEKSDATA ON ITS PAST ACHIEVEMENT AND FUTURE PLANS. SINCE1974|, THE LIBRARY CENTRE HAS BEEN BUILDING UP A DATA BASE OF NOW 280|,000|TITLES, INVALUABLE FOR LIBRARIES IN THEIR STOCK REGISTRATION. THE EXPERIENCEFROM THE AUTOMATION OF OLSTYKKE LIBRARY WILL ALSO BENEFIT THE FUTURE SYSTEM.SPECIFICATIONS FOR REGISTRATION OF MATERIALS, ISSUE CONTROL AND CATALOGUESHAVE BEEN DEVELOPED. A PROJECT CONSISTING OF MODULES WHICH LIBRARIES CANACCEPT GRADUALLY HAS NOW BEEN DEVELOPED. THE PROJECT IS DEPENDENT ON' COMPUTERREGISTRATION OF LIBRARIES' STOCK, DECENTRALISED INPUT OF DATA IN OWNTERMINALS, STANDARDISATION, GRADUAL INTRODUCTION OF MODULES AS THEY BECOMEREADY, AND LOCALLY DETERMINED SELECTION OF MODULES. THE CATALOGUING MODULEWILL BE READY AT THE END OF 1982|, THE ISSUE AND ACQUISITIONS MODULES DURING1983|. THE BETA MODULE MAKES IT POSSIBLE TO REGISTER A LIBRARY'S HOLDINGS OFTITLES ALREADY IN THE LIBRARY CENTRE BASE. SUPPLIERS OF HARDWARE ARE TO  BECHOSEN DURING SPRING 82|; RUNNING COSTS CAN, THEREFORE, NOT BE CALCULATED YET.
4824|AUTOMATION IN AUSTRIAN LIBRARIES.     PAPER PRESENTED AT THE 1|ST AUSTRIAN-SOVIET SEMINAR ON THE ROLE OF LIBRARIES INA COUNTRY'S SOCIO-ECONOMIC AND CULTURAL LIFE, HELD AT THE LENIN STATE LIBRARY,20|-22| MAR 79|. DESCRIBES AN AUTOMATED LIBRARY SYSTEM ADOPTED BY THE GRAZUNIVERSITY LIBRARY, SELECTED TO CARRY OUT AN AUTOMATION PROJECT BEFORE THEINTRODUCTION OF COMPUTERISATION IN OTHER AUSTRIAN RESEARCH LIBRARIESADMINISTERED BY THE FEDERAL MINISTRY OF SCIENCE AND RESEARCH. THE SYSTEMCOMPRISES A COMPUTERISED ISSUE SYSTEM BASED ON THE LIGHT PEN AND ON-LINECATALOGUING AND SEARCHING. WHEN THE SYSTEM BECOMES FULLY OPERATIONALTHROUGHOUT ALL LIBRARIES CONCERNED, THE NETWORK WILL BE DIVIDED BY REGIONSINTO SMALLER UNITS AND EACH LIBRARY WILL HAVE ITS MINICOMPUTER. USER SERVICESWILL BE IMPROVED BY THE POSSIBILITY OF INFORMATION RETRIEVAL THROUGH THE LARGEINTERNATIONAL DATA BASES.
4825|COLLECTION PROCESSING AS A TEAM EFFORT.     DESCRIBES THE EXPERIMENT, CARRIED OUT AT THE ARCHIVES OF APPALACHIA, TOCOMPARE THE TEAM APPROACH TO COLLECTION PROCESSING WITH THE MORE TRADITIONALONE. STUDENT-WORKERS WERE EMPLOYED ON REPETITIVE PROCESSING TASKS, INCLUDINGCLEANING/FLATTENING AND TREATMENT FOR MOULDS AND INSECT INFESTATION ANDRESULTS SHOWED THAT THE EXPERIMENTAL COLLECTIONS WERE PROCESSED EXPEDITIOUSLYWITHOUT ANY SACRIFICE IN THE QUALITY OF EITHER ARRANGEMENT OR DESCRIPTION ANDTOTAL MONTHLY OUTPUT FROM THE TEAM WAS 3| TIMES THAT FROM A SINGLE ARCHIVISTWORKING ALONE.
4826|PROPOSAL FOR A COMMON EXCHANGE/COMMUNICATION FORMAT' OPINION PAPER ONSTANDARDIZATION OF MACHINE READABLE BIBLIOGRAPHIC RECORDS.     THE INTERNATIONAL ORGANISATION FOR STANDARDIZATION DEVELOPED ITS STANDARD ISO'2709|-1973| WHICH FORMED THE BASIS FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF SEVERAL MACHINEREADABLE BIBLIOGRAPHIC RECORD FORMATS. OUTLINES A FORMAT GIVING MUCHIMPORTANCE TO THE DATA ELEMENTS AND THEIR CONSTITUENTS, WITH UNIQUEIDENTIFICATION FOR EACH OF THE CONSTITUENTS FOLLOWING A TAGGING SCHEME. AMODEL FORMAT FOR THE BIBLIOGRAPHIC DESCRIPTION OF SIMPLE MONOGRAPHS ISPRESENTED AS ILLUSTRATION WHICH REFLECTS A SINGLY LINKED LIST STRUCTURE, EACHPRECEDING TAG OF A DATA ELEMENT HAVING A FIELD GIVING THE LENGTH OF THEASSOCIATED DATA ELEMENT, WHICH SERVES AS A POINTER TO THE BEGINNING OF THESUCCEEDING TAG AND ITS ASSOCIATED DATA ELEMENT.
4827|UNIMARC.     SEVERAL AGENCIES THAT WERE FORMERLY SATISFIED BY SINGLE CONVERSIONS FROMANOTHER FORMAT ARE BEGINNING TO REQUIRE DATA FROM MULTIPLE AGENCIES. EITHERMULTIPLE CONVERSIONS MUST BE WRITTEN OR A SWITCH TO UNIMARC COULD TAKE PLACE.THE COST SAVINGS WITH UNIMARC ARE OBVIOUS. MULTIPLE CONVERSIONS PROGRAMMESREPRESENT A HIGH INITIAL INVESTMENT AND A TREMENDOUS PROBLEM IN KEEPING UPWITH ALL OF THE CHANGES TO NECESSARILY DYNAMIC NATIONAL FORMATS. THEINTRODUCTION OF AACR2| AND RESULTANT NATIONAL FORMAT CHANGES ARE AT THIS TIMECAUSING SEVERAL AGENCIES TO REWRITE CONVERSION PROGRAMMES. A MAJOR OBSTACLE TOA TRULY INTERNATIONAL UNIMARC EXCHANGE IS THAT THE CHANGE TAKES A JOINTCOMMITMENT SINCE AN AGENCY'S ABILITY TO RECEIVE UNIMARC RECORDS IS USELESS IFTHE SENDING AGENCY CANNOT SEND THEM. IFLA AND ITS MEMBERS NEED TO UNDERTAKE AMAJOR EFFORT TO BRING A UNIMARC PROGRAMME INTO SERVICE.
4828|THE PHILSOM AUTOMATED SERIALS CONTROL SYSTEM' AN INTRODUCTION.     DESCRIBES THE PHILSOM AUTOMATED SERIALS CONTROL SYSTEM DEVELOPED AT THEWASHINGTON UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE LIBRARY AT ST. LOUIS, WHICH PROVIDESAUTOMATED SUPPORT FOR THE FULL RANGE OF SERIALS CONTROL ACTIVITY WITHIN THELIBRARIES PARTICIPATING IN THE PHILSOM NETWORK. THE PHILSOM SYSTEM ATTEMPTS TOPREDICT THE ISSUES WHICH WILL BE RECEIVED BY THE VARIOUS PARTICIPATINGLIBRARIES AND TO PROVIDE THEM WITH RECORDS DESCRIBING EACH OF THESE ISSUES.THE RECORDS FOR CHECKED-IN ISSUES AUTOMATICALLY UPDATE THE HOLDINGS DATA, ANDINTERACT WITH PREVIOUSLY CODED DATA TO PRODUCE CLAIMS AND BINDINGNOTIFICATIONS. THE SYSTEM ALSO PRODUCES ADDITIONAL OUTPUTS TO AID IN SERIALSCONTROL.
4829|FOREIGN LITERATURE ACQUISITIONS IN THE SWEDISH NATIONAL LIBRARY.     PAPER PRESENTED AT THE 1|ST SWEDISH-SOVIET SEMINAR ON 'THE NATIONAL LIBRARYWITHIN A COUNTRY'S LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SERVICES' DEVELOPMENT PROSPECTS'HELD IN MOSCOW, 21|-22| NOV 78|. FOREIGN LITERATURE ACQUISITIONS IN THE ROYALLIBRARY REFLECT THE LIBRARY'S 2| MAIN FUNCTIONS, THAT OF THE SWEDISH NATIONALLIBRARY AND STOCKHOLM'S CENTRAL LIBRARY IN THE FIELDS OF HUMANITIES AND SOCIALSCIENCES. MATERIAL ACQUIRED IN KEEPING WITH THE 1|ST FUNCTION (SUECANAEXTRANEA) IS DIVIDED INTO 4| SECTIONS-FOREIGN TRANSLATIONS OF SWEDISH WRITERS'WORKS, WORKS IN SWEDISH PUBLISHED ABROAD, WORKS ON SWEDEN AND WORKS OF SWEDISHNATIONALS PUBLISHED ABROAD. EXCHANGES OF PUBLICATIONS WITH LIBRARIES IN OTHERCOUNTRIES ARE AN IMPORTANT FACTOR IN ACQUISITIONS ESPECIALLY WITH REGARD TOTHE LIBRARY'S 2|ND FUNCTION.
4830|HOW TO ACHIEVE A RATIONAL STATEMENT, OR THAT IS ON THE NEED TO CHANGE THEACQUISITION AND CONTROL OF BOOK COLLECTIONS.     CONSIDERS IN DETAIL THE PRESENT SITUATION IN POLAND BY WHICH NEW PUBLICATIONSARE ORDERED AND DISTRIBUTED FROM A CENTRALISED STOCK CONTROL. THE SYSTEM WHICHHAS MANY FAULTS IS CRITICISED AND SOME SUGGESTIONS ARE MADE FOR ITSALTERATION.
4831|CENTRALISED DISTRICT SYSTEM OF ACQUISITION.     IN SLOVAK PUBLIC LIBRARIES 3| MODES OF ACQUISITIONS ARE PRACTISED AT PRESENT'THE INDIVIDUAL ONE, IN WHICH EVERY LIBRARY TRIES TO SATISFY ITS USERS' NEEDSFROM ITS OWN STOCK; COMBINED MODE IN WHICH THE DISTRICT LIBRARY PROVIDES SOMELIBRARIES IN THE DISTRICT WITH LITERATURE; TOTAL CENTRALISATION OFACQUISITION, PRACTISED BY 17| DISTRICT LIBRARIES. THE LATTER IS THE MOSTRATIONAL MEANS OF ACQUISITION ON CONDITION THAT THE LITERATURE IS PROCESSED IN1| CENTRE AND THAT A COLLECTIVE CATALOGUE IS KEPT. EACH CENTRAL LIBRARY MUSTFORMULATE ITS ACQUISITION POLICY TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THE REQUIREMENTS OFREADERS/USERS OF THE INDIVIDUAL LIBRARIES.
4832|THE GUIDELINE ON STOCK EXPANSION IN GENERAL PUBLIC LIBRARIES.     IN THE 1976|-80| GUIDELINES ON LIBRARIES IN EAST GERMANY, LONG-TERM STOCKPLANNING WAS ADVOCATED ON A BASIS OF DIFFERENTIAL VALUES FOR STOCK ITEMS PERINHABITANT, SO THAT STOCKS CAN BE ACQUIRED WHICH ALLOW FOR SOCIAL DEMANDS.FUNCTIONAL EQUIPPING OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF LIBRARY IS NECESSARY TO FACILITATEREGIONAL PURCHASING SCHEME DEVELOPMENT. THE STOCK GUIDELINE FOR 1981|-85|EMPHASISES STOCK EXPANSION AND THE PURCHASE OF REPLACEMENT COPIES; OTHERGUIDELINES COVER THE EXPANSION OF AUDIO-VISUAL MEDIA SERVICES, NEW RULES ONTHE PURCHASE OF PERIODICALS AND NEWSPAPERS AND EXTRA PROVISION OF BOOKS INHOLIDAY RESORTS. THE LATEST GUIDELINES SHOULD REMOVE UNJUSTIFIABLE DIFFERENCESIN STOCK STANDARDS.
4833|SELECTED ASPECTS FROM THE CHANGE OF GUIDELINES ON STOCK EXPANSION IN LIBRARIESIN THE LEIPZIG AREA.     IN 1975| THE NUMBER OF STOCK ITEMS PER INHABITANT IN LEIPZIG LIBRARIES WASSLIGHTLY BELOW THE NATIONAL AVERAGE, SO PLANS FOR 1976|-80| EMPHASISED STOCKEXPANSION. VARIABLE PROVISION STANDARDS WERE CALCULATED FOR CENTRAL AND BRANCHLIBRARIES. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS OF RESULTS FOR THIS PERIOD SHOWS A LARGE STOCKBUDGET, SO THAT IN SEVERAL AREAS THE REQUIRED LEVELS OF STOCK PROVISION WEREREACHED OR EVEN EXCEEDED. ONLY SOME OF THE MOST DENSELY POPULATED AREAS FELLBELOW THE REQUISITE STANDARDS. OTHER AIMS FOR 1976|-80| WERE THE EXPANSION ANDQUALITATIVE IMPROVEMENT OF STOCKS IN THE CENTRAL LIBRARY AND THE RAISING OFPERIODICAL SUBSCRIPTION CHARGES. PARTICULAR DIFFICULTY WAS EXPERIENCED WITHSTOCKS FOR RURAL LIBRARIES, ESPECIALLY FOR PART-TIME BRANCH LIBRARIES;GUIDELINES FOR 1981|-85| AIM TO IMPROVE THIS ASPECT OF THE SERVICE.
4834|RUSHMORE AT BERKELEY' THE DYNAMICS OF DEVELOPING A WRITTEN COLLECTIONDEVELOPMENT POLICY STATEMENT.

PROVIDES AN ACCOUNT OF THE DYNAMICSOF THE PROCESS OF COLLECTION DEVELOPMENT DESIGN AND THE COOPERATIVE EFFORTS OF65| BOOK SELECTORS IN RECORDING POLICY DECISIONS AGREED UPON FOR THE COLLECTINGLEVELS IN ALL AREAS OF HUMAN KNOWLEDGE APPROPRIATE TO SUPPORT THE COMPLEXRESEARCH AND INSTRUCTIONAL NEEDS OF A LARGE UNIVERSITY.
4835|AT THE BEGINNING OF THE TITLE SERVICE FOR SCHOOL LIBRARIES.     SINCE 1979| A PROJECT GROUP OF THE DEUTSCHE BIBLIOTHEKSINSTITUT (GERMAN LIBRARYINSTITUTE) COMMITTEE ON SCHOOL LIBRARIES HAS BEEN INVOLVED IN PREPARATORY WORKTOWARDS A BOOK REVIEWING SERVICE SPECIFICALLY FOR SCHOOL LIBRARIES. THESERVICE AIMS TO COVER ALL BOOKS OTHER THAN TEXTBOOKS WHICH ARE SUITABLE FORUSE BY TEACHERS AND PUPILS IN EDUCATIONAL OR LEISURE PURSUITS. THE MATERIALCOVERED WILL CATER FOR ALL CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE AT GENERAL OR VOCATIONALSCHOOLS. A PRELIMINARY SURVEY WAS MADE OF SCHOOLS, LIBRARIES AND EDUCATIONALINSTITUTES IN ORDER TO ASCERTAIN REQUIREMENTS. 1| PILOT EDITION CONTAINING 200|REVIEWS WILL APPEAR IN FEB/MAR 82|, A 2|ND EDITION IS PLANNED FOR THE AUTUMN. IFTHE PROJECT IS REALISED, IT WILL ULTIMATELY COVER 2|,000| TITLES A YEAR.
4836|THE LEGAL DEPOSIT LEGISLATION AS THE BASIS OF THE NATIONAL COLLECTION OFPRINTED MATERIALS IN THE ROYAL LIBRARY.     PAPER PRESENTED AT THE 1|ST SWEDISH-SOVIET SEMINAR ON 'THE NATIONAL LIBRARYWITHIN A COUNTRY'S LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SERVICES' DEVELOPMENT PROSPECTS'HELD IN MOSCOW, 21|-22| NOV 78|. AFTER A SHORT INTRODUCTION INTO THE HISTORY OFLEGAL DEPOSIT LEGISLATION IN SCANDINAVIA, CONCENTRATES ON ITS DEVELOPMENT INSWEDEN. NEW LEGAL DEPOSIT LAW CAME INTO FORCE IN 1979|, THE PREVIOUSLEGISLATION HAVING BEEN PASSED IN 1949|. THE 2| LAWS ARE COMPARED ANDDIFFERENCES BETWEEN THEM AND REASONS FOR THE INTRODUCTION OF THE NEW LAW AREDISCUSSED. THE NEW LAW BRINGS CHANGES NOT ONLY IN THE NUMBER OF COPIESPUBLISHERS WILL NOW HAVE TO DEPOSIT OF BOOKS (NOW 7|, PREVIOUSLY 5|) BUT ALSOWIDENS THE RANGE OF DEPOSIT MATERIALS. ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES CONNECTEDWITH THE DEPOSITS ARE MENTIONED.
4837|TWO YEARS OF DEALING WITH SWEDISH PUBLICATIONS.     DESCRIBES HOW LINKOPING UNIVERSITY LIBRARY COPES WITH THE DEPOSIT COPIES OF200|,000| SWEDISH PUBLICATIONS PER YEAR WHICH IT HAS BEEN RECEIVING SINCE ITBECAME A DEPOSIT LIBRARY ON 1| JAN 79|. BY USING THE LIST OF SWEDISH PERIODICALSSOME PRIOR CATALOGUING COULD BE DONE. A PLAN FOR DISTRIBUTION OF THE MATERIALACCORDING TO SUBJECT TO THE 7| UNITS WHICH CONSTITUTE THE UNIVERSITY LIBRARYWAS DRAWN UP. AFTER 2| YEARS SOME PUBLISHERS ARE STILL NOT AWARE OF THEIR DUTYTO DELIVER, AND ROUTINES FOR CLAIMING HAVE HAD TO BE DEVELOPED. THE MONOGRAPHCOPIES RECEIVED ARE INTENDED AS REGIONAL COPIES FOR DISTRIBUTION TO OTHERINSTITUTIONS WITHIN THE REGION, OR COPIES FOR USE WITHIN THE UNIVERSITY; APOLICY OF WITHDRAWAL WAS DEVELOPED, AS NO ARCHIVAL DUTY EXISTS. PROBLEMS WERECAUSED BY THE NUMBER AND LATE DELIVERY OF PERIODICALS. HANDLING OF LEAFLETSAND OTHER EPHEMERA HAS PROVED MOST COMPLICATED AND TIME CONSUMING, AND THISMATERIAL REMAINS UNCATALOGUED. THE QUESTION OF ITS FUTURE NEEDS URGENTLY TO BEDECIDED.
4838|STUDIES IN THE INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGE OF PUBLICATIONS.     COLLECTION OF PAPERS PRESENTED AT MEETINGS OF THE IFLA SECTION ON THE EXCHANGEOF PUBLICATIONS, (NOW THE SECTION ON EXCHANGE AND ACQUISITION), ON SUBJECTSRELATING TO INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGE OF PUBLICATIONS.

4839|COST-EFFECTIVENESS OF SOVIET SERIAL EXCHANGES.     WHILE THE TRADITIONAL VIEW HAS BEEN THAT SOVIET PUBLICATIONS WERE BESTACQUIRED THROUGH EXCHANGES, A RECENT REVIEW OF SOVIET SERIALS AT DUKEUNIVERSITY LIBRARY SUGGESTS THAT THIS MAY NO LONGER BE AS TRUE AS IT ONCE WAS.THE AVAILABILITY OF SOVIET PUBLICATIONS THROUGH NORMAL TRADE CHANNELS HASINCREASED IN RECENT YEARS. BECAUSE OF THIS FACT, THE IMPORTANCE OF MAINTAININGEQUITABLE EXCHANGES IN ECONOMIC TERMS HAS INCREASED. OUR EXAMINATION HAS SHOWNTHAT IT SHOULD NOT BE ASSUMED THAT SUCH EXCHANGES ARE EQUITABLE. REGULARREVIEWS ARE RECOMMENDED TO SERVE THE NEEDS OF LIBRARIES BEST.
4840|RD MEETING OF SPECIALISTS FROM SOCIALIST COUNTRIES ON UNION CATALOGUES ANDINTERLIBRARY LOANS.R     EPORTS ON THE 3|RD MEETING HELD IN BERLIN 28|-30| OCT 80|.

4844|SURVEY OF THE PERIODICAL STOCK AT THE LIBRARY OF THE INSTITUTE OF PUBLICHEALTH.     THE GROWTH OF THE HUNGARIAN INSTITUTE OF PUBLIC HEALTH'S OBJECTIVES ANDRESEARCH TEAM, THE LACK OF SPACE AND THE RISE IN JOURNAL PRICES INDUCED THELIBRARIANS TO EXAMINE THE USAGE OF JOURNALS. THEY WISHED TO ESTABLISH JOURNALSWHICH NEED NOT BE SUBSCRIBED TO ANY LONGER; JOURNALS WHICH COULD BE PLACED INREMOTE STORAGE; AND JOURNALS WHICH READERS REGULARLY REQUIRE BUT WHICH ARE NOTAVAILABLE IN THE LIBRARY. DATA WERE COLLECTED FROM 1| NOV 77| -30| APR 78|. AS ARESULT OF THE INVESTIGATION IT CAN BE LAID DOWN THAT THE LIBRARY CAN COMPLY,FROM ITS OWN STOCK, WITH A LARGE PART OF READERS' DEMANDS FOR JOURNALS. THESMALLER PART (29|%) OF THE STOCK FULFILS 77|% OF DEMANDS, THE LARGER PROPORTIONIS LITTLE USED. THE NUMBER OF JOURNALS NOT USED AT ALL IS SMALL. JOURNALS USEDLESS WILL BE PUT IN DISTANT STACKS; CURRENT JOURNALS AND OFTEN USED VOLUMESWILL BE STORED IN THE LIBRARY.

REPORTS ON A CONFERENCE ON ON-LINE INFORMATION, ORGANISED BY THE BRITISHLIBRARY AND HELD IN SEPT 81|, WITH THE AIM OF EXAMINING RECENT EXPERIMENTS WITHON-LINE INFORMATION SERVICE IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES, SEEING THEM IN ACTION, ANDDISCUSSING RELATED ASPECTS SUCH AS FEES. DISTINGUISHES BETWEEN DIFFERENT FORMSOF INFORMATION' FACTS; AND INFORMATION ABOUT INFORMATION, SUCH AS PARTICULARBOOKS OR SUBJECTS. TO HANDLE THE STREAM OF INFORMATION, LIBRARIES NEED NEWTECHNOLOGY. ONLY IF INFORMATION IS ELECTRONICALLY REGISTERED CAN ALLINFORMATION BE ACCESSIBLE ON-LINE TO EVERYONE. PROBLEMS THEN ARISE OF ACTUALLYOBTAINING THE INFORMATION AND SELECTING THE AMOUNT NEEDED. STANDARDISATION OFCATALOGUING AND SYSTEMS IS NEEDED. THE HOLDINGS OF DANISH LIBRARIES SHOULD BEELECTRONICALLY REGISTERED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE TO MAKE THEM AVAILABLE ON-LINETO GROUPS WITHIN POLITICS, BUSINESS, AND EDUCATION AND TO INDIVIDUALS. THEBIROS EXPERIMENT IN ENGLAND SHOWS THAT PUBLIC LIBRARIES CAN HANDLE THIS TASK.THE NEW INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY COULD BE THE POINT OF COOPERATION BETWEEN ALLLIBRARIES.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EEC HAD IN 1972| DECIDED TO SET UP A EUROPEANDATA TRANSMISSION NETWORK, EURONET, OPERATED BY THE NATIONAL TELECOMMUNICATIONSERVICES, IN ORDER TO SUPPORT A EUROPEAN INFORMATION INDUSTRY IN THE FACE OFUS COMPETITION. THE 36| HOSTS, ORGANISATIONS AND PRIVATE SERVICE BUREAUX, WHICHOFFER ACCESS TO INFORMATION IN THE FORM OF 271| DIFFERENT DATA BASES AND DATABANKS, ARE GATHERED UNDER THE NETWORK DIANE. DISTINGUISHES BETWEEN DATA BASES,USUALLY STORING BIBLIOGRAPHIC DATA, AND DATA BANKS, MOSTLY WITH INSTANTLYUSABLE DATA. FULL TEXT BASES AND REGISTERS OF ACTIVITIES AND ADDRESSES AREALSO GAINING IN IMPORTANCE. TO SPREAD THE KNOWLEDGE OF EURONET-DIANE'SINFORMATION SERVICES, ADVISORY CENTRES ARE SET UP IN THE INDIVIDUAL COUNTRIES,VIZ. THE DANISH DIANE CENTRE. THE CENTRE HOPES TO ADVISE ON ALL DATA BASES ANDDATA BANKS WH ICH CAN BE USED IN DENMARK, INCLUDING US, EUROPEAN ANDSCANDINAVIAN NETWORKS. THE CENTRE AIMS TO ADVISE ON THE OPTIMAL USE OF ON-LINEINFORMATION SERVICES THROUGH DIRECT ASSISTANCE TO INDIVIDUALS, COURSES ANDPUBLICATIONS.

IN MAR 80| A SURVEY OF READERS' OPINIONS ON THE FOROTHEKWAS CARRIED OUT; INFORMATION FROM 500| QUESTIONNAIRES IS ANALYSED IN DETAIL.MOST PEOPLE LIKED THE FOROTHEK; IT HELPED MANY READERS TO USE THE MAIN LIBRARYMORE EASILY AND TO DISCOVER FRESH INTERESTS.
4921|THE NON-DEPARTMENTAL LIBRARY.     DESCRIBES AN EXPERIMENT WITH A DEPARTMENT COMMON TO ADULTS AND CHILDREN IN THENEW LIBRARY IN EMMABODA, OPENED IN AUTUMN 80|. THE SHAPE OF THE NEW LIBRARYMADE IT DIFFICULT TO DIVIDE IT INTO DEPARTMENTS AND THE POSSIBILITY OF SAVINGSIN ACQUISITION OF MATERIAL SUITABLE FOR BOTH ADULTS AND CHILDREN, OR FOR YOUNGPEOPLE ON THE BORDERLINE OF ADULTHOOD PERSUADED THE LIBRARY TO TRY TOINTEGRATE THE MATERIAL. THE LIBRARY IS DIVIDED INTO FICTION AND NON-FICTION,WITH NON-FICTION BOOKS FOR CHILDREN PLACED AFTER THOSE FOR ADULTS ON THE SAMESHELF; ADULT FICTION AND CHILDREN'S FICTION HAVE THEIR OWN SHELVES, BUT IN THESAME PLACE IN THE HALL. AN AREA IN CONNECTION WITH THE ISSUE DESK CONTAINSPERIODICALS AND PICTURE BOOKS WITH SEATING FOR ALL AGES, INCLUDING HEADPHONESFOR CHILDREN. AFTER A YEAR THE EXPERIENCE HAS PROVED ENTIRELY POSITIVE.
4922|FREE ACCESS TO READING' A NEW POLICY OF OPPORTUNITIES.     CRITICISES THE PUBLIC LIBRARY POLICY OF DIVIDING CHILDREN'S BOOKS ACCORDING TOAGE LEVEL AS CONTRARY TO THE READER'S RIGHT TO SELECT MATERIAL APPROPRIATE TOHIS OWN ABILITIES. DRAWS ON RECENT STUDIES BY BRAZILIAN RESEARCHERS TOESTABLISH THAT FLUENCY IN READING IS A SKILL ACQUIRED PROGRESSIVELY AT ANINDIVIDUAL RATE DETERMINED BOTH BY AN INCREASE IN MECHANICAL FACILITY AND THEPROCESS OF MATURING. THUS THE READER'S AGE DOES NOT NECESSARILY CORRESPOND TOHIS READING CAPACITY, AND ARTIFICIAL DIVISIONS IMPOSED BY LIBRARIESEFFECTIVELY PREVENT ACCESS TO SUITABLE MATERIAL. THE ECONOMIC AND SOCIALADVANTAGES OF PERMITTING FREE CHOICE OF BOOKS ARE DISCUSSED IN RELATION TOPOPULARISING LIBRARIES AND MAXIMISING USE OF THEIR RESOURCES.

4932|USING THE TEXT TELEPHONE-SOMETHING FOR LIBRARIES?.     DESCRIBES THE TEXT TELEPHONE INSTALLED IN LANDSKRONA PUBLIC LIBRARY EARLY IN1981| FOR THE USE OF THE DEAF AND SPEECH IMPAIRED. IT CONSISTS OF 3| UNITS' ANORDINARY TELEPHONE, A KEYBOARD USED TO TYPE THE TEXT, AND A SCREEN MONITOR,WHICH RECEIVES AND TRANSMITS THE TEXT. THE HANDICAPPED PERSON NEEDS ALSO ASIGNAL RELAY, WHICH TRANSFORMS THE AUDIBLE TELEPHONE SIGNALS TO VISUALSIGNALS, AND HE MUST BE ABLE TO TYPE AS THE KEYBOARD IS THAT OF A STANDARDTYPEWRITER. DISABLED PEOPLE CAN CONTACT OTHERS WITH SIMILAR EQUIPMENT, BUTCONTACT TO AN ORDINARY TELEPHONE REQUIRES A TRANSFORMER. THE TELEPHONEDIRECTORY HAS SPECIAL MARKINGS FOR TEXT TELEPHONES. EXPANSION OF THE SERVICE,WHICH PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY TO REACH NEW AND ISOLATED GROUPS, HAS BEENLIMITED BY LACK OF FINANCE.
4933|READING AND SUCCESSFUL LIVING.     PAPER PRESENTED AT THE SYMPOSIUM 'READING AND SUCCESSFUL LIVING' THEFAMILY-SCHOOL PARTNERSHIP', LIBRARY OF CONGRESS, CENTER FOR THE BOOK, NOV 81|.EXAMINES THE ROLE OF READING IN THE WIDEST SENSE OF PROVIDING ADULTS WITH AMEANS OF UNDERSTANDING THE WORLD AND PROVIDING TOOL FOR IMPROVING THE QUALITYOF LIFE.

DESCRIBES A NUMBER OF STUDIES WHICH HAVE SHOWED THAT READERS UNDERSTAND ANDENJOY THEIR READING MORE WHEN THEY SHARE AN AUTHOR'S CULTURAL BACKGROUND,BELIEFS AND ASSUMPTIONS. THE WAY IN WHICH SHARED CULTURAL KNOWLEDGE (OR LACKOF IT) CAN AFFECT READING COMPREHENSION IS DESCRIBED.
4935|LITERATURE AND READING IN THE GERMAN DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC.     STATISTICS FOR THE LAST 10| YEARS IN EAST GERMANY REFLECT THE SUCCESS ACHIEVEDBY THE PUBLISHING INDUSTRY IN STIMULATING PUBLIC INTEREST IN READING AND INTRYING TO SATISFY READERS' NEEDS. THE IMPORTANCE OF PROVIDING THE WIDESTPOSSIBLE RANGE OF MATERIAL ON DIFFERENT SUBJECTS AND IN DIFFERENT LANGUAGES ISRECOGNISED. FOREIGN MATERIAL MOST IN DEMAND IS THAT FROM THE USSR, FOLLOWED BYWORKS FROM OTHER COMMUNIST COUNTRIES AND FROM THE THIRD WORLD. NATURALLY AWIDE RANGE OF CONTEMPORARY DOMESTIC LITERATURE IS ALSO AVAILABLE. IN 1980|,LIBRARY STOCKS TOTALLED 80| MILLION ITEMS AND THE BOOKTRADE TURNOVER HASINCREASED BY 32|% DURING THE LAST 5| YEARS. CLOSE LINKS HAVE BEEN DEVELOPEDBETWEEN AUTHORS, PUBLISHERS AND THE PUBLIC. MORE RESEARCH INTO READING HABITSAND COMMUNICATION THROUGH LITERATURE IS REQUIRED.
4936|A VILLAGE WITH ONLY THREE BOOKS.     DISCUSSES A SHORT STORY BY A CONTEMPORARY BRAZILIAN WRITER DEPICTING AFICTITIOUS BRAZILIAN VILLAGE AT THE TURN OF THE CENTURY WHERE ONLY 3| BOOKS AREAVAILABLE, CONTRASTING THE CULTURAL DEPRIVATION OF THE VILLAGERS WITH THE RICHLITERARY EXPERIENCE OF CHARACTERS DEPICTED IN EUROPEAN FICTION.

IN A MEMORANDUM OF FEB 81| IT WASDECIDED THAT THE CAMPAIGN SHOULD CONSIST OF 2| PROJECTS' A REGIONAL PROJECT, INWHICH NEW METHODS SHOULD BE USED TO STIMULATE INTEREST IN READING AND IMPROVETHE DISTRIBUTION OF BOOKS, AND THE EFFECTS OF THE METHODS EVALUATED; AND ANATIONAL INFORMATION CAMPAIGN WITH THE OBJECT OF GIVING INFORMATION ABOUTBOOKS, AND STIMULATE INTEREST IN THE REGIONAL PROJECT. CONTACT WITH VARIOUSORGANISATIONS WAS MADE, ABOVE ALL THE PUBLIC LIBRARY COMMISSION. IN THEREGIONAL PROJECT THE EMPHASIS WAS TO BE ON LOCAL INVOLVEMENT. THE PROJECT,CALLED THE DALA PROJECT, IS TO START IN THE AUTUMN 81| IN THE KOPPARBERG REGIONAND HAS 4| CORNERSTONES' SCHOOLS, PUBLIC LIBRARIES, STUDY CIRCLES AND MASSMEDIA. THE PROJECT SHOULD LEAD TO COOPERATION AND BETTER USE OF RESOURCES, BUTALSO TO SUGGESTIONS FOR MODELS FOR FUTURE LOCAL LIBRARY  SERVICES AND FOR THEOPINION FORMING ROLE OF THE CULTURAL COUNCIL.
4938|AN EXAMINATION OF BOOK BUYERS AND LIBRARY USERS.     VERY FEW PEOPLE EITHER ONLY BUY THEIR BOOKS OR ONLY OBTAIN THEM FROM A LIBRARYAND MANY PEOPLE BUY BOOKS AS OFTEN AS THEY BORROW THEM. LIBRARY USERS WHOBORROW FEW BOOKS BUY A LARGER PROPORTION OF THEIR BOOKS THAN LIBRARY USERS WHOBORROW MANY BOOKS. HOWEVER, WHEREAS OVER 1|/2| THE POPULATION OF GERMANY BUYBOOKS, ONLY ABOUT 1|/4| USE PUBLIC LIBRARIES. INVESTIGATIONS HAVE REVEALED THATIMPORTANT INFLUENCES ON BEHAVIOUR REGARDING THE USE OF BOOKS INCLUDE THE HOMEBACKGROUND, SCHOOL AND GENERAL SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT. AN INDIVIDUAL'S SENSE OFVALUES ALSO PLAYS ITS PART, OFTEN INFLUENCED BY THE MEDIA AND COMMUNICATIONPOSSIBILITIES. PERHAPS THE MAIN INFLUENCE IS THE SOCIAL LEARNING PROCESS ANDAN INDIVIDUAL'S OWN ATTITUDE TOWARDS IT. THERE ARE STILL NUMEROUS UNEXPLOREDPOSSIBILITIES FOR INFLUENCING CHILDREN AND ADULTS IN THEIR USE OF BOOKS.
4939|WHAT DO CHILDREN KNOW ABOUT CHILDREN'S BOOKS?.     PRESENTS THE RESPONSES OF 8| CHILDREN, AGED BETWEEN 6| AND 11|, TO QUESTIONSABOUT THEIR READING, DESIGNED TO ELUCIDATE THEIR PREFERENCES AND DISLIKES. THEBOOKS CITED ARE MAINLY CONTEMPORARY BRAZILIAN WORKS. NO BIBLIOGRAPHICALDETAILS ARE GIVEN.

A READING CAMPAIGN WAS CARRIED OUT IN CLASS 3|B OF ISLEV SCHOOL IN RODOVRE,DENMARK, IN WHICH THE PUPILS AIMED TO READ AT HOME A TOTAL OF 200| BOOKS FROMTHE SCHOOL LIBRARY IN 9| WEEKS. THE READERS WERE GIVEN A TIME IN WHICH TO READEACH BOOK AND USED A FORM TO REPORT ON THE CONTENT, ILLUSTRATIONS AND EASE OFREADING. THESE COMMENTS WERE READ TO THE CLASS EACH WEEK. THE 1|ST BATCH OFBOOKS WAS CHOSEN BY THE 2| TEACHERS CONCERNED, THE NEXT BY TEACHERS AND PUPILSTOGETHER IN THE LIBRARY, AND THE LAST MAINLY BY THE PUPILS THEMSELVES. IF NOBOOK ATTRACTED A CHILD, HE OR SHE COULD CHOSE 1| FROM THE LIBRARY WITH HELPFROM THE LIBRARIAN. A 'BOOK THERMOMETER' IN THE CLASSROOM SHOWED PROGRESS INREADING THE 200| BOOKS. AN EXHIBITION ON THE PROJECT WAS MOUNTED IN THE LIBRARYAND A TAPE WAS MADE OF SOME OF THE READERS' OPINIONS. THE CAMPAIGN STIMULATEDINTEREST IN READING AND IN BORROWING BOOKS FROM THE SCHOOL LIBRARY AND SOMECHILDREN WHO HAD NEVER READ A BOOK BEFORE NOW DID SO, SOMETIMES AS A RESULT OFTHE RECORDED COMMENTS. THE AIM WAS FULFILLED, ALL 200| BOOKS BEING READ DURINGTHE 9|-WEEK PERIOD.
4941|THE ROMANIZATION OF CYRILLIC SCRIPT.     IN TERMS OF PUBLISHED LITERATURE RUSSIAN LANGUAGE MATERIAL IS 2|ND ONLY TOENGLISH LANGUAGE PRODUCTION. HOWEVER, THERE IS STILL NO GENERALLY ACCEPTEDSCHEME IN THE WESTERN WORLD FOR CONVERTING CYRILLIC CHARACTERS INTO ROMANSCRIPT. TRANSCRIPTION, BY WHICH CYRILLIC CHARACTERS ARE ROMANIZED INTOPHONEMES, GIVES GOOD RESULTS FOR PRONUNCIATION BUT LEADS TO A NUMBER OFALTERNATIVE SPELLINGS, WHILST TRANSLITERATION, BY WHICH A SINGLE ROMANCHARACTER IS SUBSTITUTED FOR EACH CYRILLIC CHARACTER LEADS TO PRONUNCIATIONDIFFICULTIES. WITH THE GROWTH IN SCHEMES FOR CATALOGUE AUTOMATION IT ISESSENTIAL THAT A SOLUTION IS FOUND TO THIS PROBLEM. RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THATTHE ISO STANDARD OFFERS THE BEST SOLUTION ALTHOUGH THIS HAS UNFORTUNATELYFOUND LITTLE FAVOUR IN THE USA AND UK.
4942|THE DEVELOPMENT OF INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION IN THE FIELD OF BIBLIOGRAPHY.     THE DEVELOPMENT OF INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION IN THE FIELD OF BIBLIOGRAPHY ISDIVIDED INTO 3| PERIODS' ORGANISATION AND FORMATION (END OF 19|TH-BEGINNING OF20|TH CENTURY); FOUNDATION OF BIBLIOGRAPHIC ORGANISATIONS AND THE CONDUCT OFTHE FIRST COOPERATED RESEARCH (1919|-1939|); AND WIDE COOPERATION AMONGBIBLIOGRAPHERS IN THE FRAMEWORK OF INTERNATIONAL AND REGIONAL ORGANISATIONSAND THE REALISATION OF INTERNATIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHICAL PROGRAMMES (FROM 1945|). ABRIEF ACCOUNT IS GIVEN OF DEVELOPMENTS WITHIN EACH PERIOD UP TO 1970|S.
4943|COMPUTERISATION OF THE CURRENT NATIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHY.     A SCHEME FOR THE COMPUTERISATION OF THE CURRENT NATIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHY INBULGARIA HAS BEEN IN PROGRESS SINCE 1978| AND ALL MAJOR SCIENTIFIC AND CENTRALREGIONAL LIBRARIES ARE PARTICIPATING IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE SCHEME. 8|SERIES ARE PLANNED, INCLUDING A BIBLIOGRAPHY OF CONTEMPORARY BULGARIANLITERATURE, AND BIBLIOGRAPHIES OF PUBLICATIONS ISSUED BY VARIOUS GOVERNMENTAGENCIES, DISSERTATIONS, GRAMOPHONE RECORDS, AND BULGARIAN PERIODICALS ANDARTICLES IN DAILY PAPERS. THERE WILL ALSO BE A BIBLIOGRAPHY OF FOREIGNLITERATURE ON BULGARIA, TOGETHER WITH 1| OF BULGARIAN BIBLIOGRAPHIES. THEFREQUENCY OF PUBLICATION WILL RANGE FROM 1| WEEK, AS IN THE CASE OF CATALOGUECARDS, THROUGH BI-WEEKLY, MONTHLY AND QUARTERLY BULLETINS TO ANNUAL INDEXES OREVEN CUMULATIVE INDEXES PUBLISHED ONCE EVERY FEW YEARS. THE INTRODUCTION OF ANAPPROPRIATE SYSTEM, INCLUDING MINICOMPUTERS AND VIDEOTERMINI, MUST BEACCOMPANIED BY THE INTRODUCTION OF UPDATED NATIONAL STANDARDS ON BIBLIOGRAPHICDESCRIPTION, COMPILED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS, ISBD(M)AND ISBD(S).
4944|REGIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHIES.     IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE DYNAMIC DEVELOPMENT IN SOCIALIST COUNTRIES, GREATERATTENTION HAS BEEN TURNED TO REGIONAL AND LOCAL PROBLEMS RECENTLY. MEMBERS OFTHE GOVERNING BODIES MUST THEREFORE BE KEPT ABREAST OF THE LATEST INFORMATIONON THEIR REGIONS TO BE ABLE TO RUN THEIR ECONOMY SMOOTHLY AND TO PURSUE THECORRECT CULTURAL AND OTHER POLICIES. THUS DEPARTMENTS OF LOCAL HISTORY INLIBRARIES, AND THOSE IN THE CENTRAL DISTRICT LIBRARIES IN PARTICULAR, HAVE THEDUTY AND RESPONSIBILITY TO BUILD UP APPROPRIATE BIBLIOGRAPHIC RESOURCES. INADDITION TO BOOKS, DAILY PAPERS AND PERIODICALS, NON-BOOK MATERIALS SUCH ASRECORDS, TAPES, DOCUMENTARY FILMS, SLIDES, PHOTOS AND PICTURE POSTCARDS HAVEBECOME RATHER SIGNIFICANT. AS TO CONTENTS, MATERIALS HAVE TO BE SIFTED VERYCAREFULLY TO GIVE A COMPREHENSIVE KNOWLEDGE OF FACTS, EVENTS AND DEVELOPMENTIN THE RELEVANT REGION.
4945|THE CRISIS OF DANISH SPECIALISED BIBLIOGRAPHIES.     ARGUES THAT, WHEREAS THE DANISH NATIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHY IS IN NO DANGER AS IT ISSUBSIDISED THROUGH THE LIBRARY CENTRE AND ACQUIRED WIDELY BY ALL TYPES OFLIBRARY, THE SELECTIVE, SPECIALISED BIBLIOGRAPHIES ARE GIVEN LOW PRIORITY. THENATIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHY HAS TRADITIONALLY FORMED THE BASIS OF COMPILATION OFSELECTIVE BIBLIOGRAPHIES, BUT WITH AUTOMATION IT IS LESS SUITABLE FOR SUBJECTSEARCHES. GIVES EXAMPLES OF SPECIALISED BIBLIOGRAPHIES WHOSE SELECTIONS ARENOT BASED ON THE EVALUATION OF QUALIFIED PEOPLE OF THE TOTAL PRODUCTION WITHINA SUBJECT. THE DANISH JOINT BIBLIOGRAPHIC COMMITTEE SET UP ON THE INSTIGATIONOF UNESCO LACKS INFLUENCE ON THE PRODUCTION OF SPECIALISED BIBLIOGRAPHIES.URGES THE LIBRARY CENTRE AND PUBLIC LIBRARIES TO PAY AS MUCH ATTENTION TO THEANALYTICAL, DANISH SPECIALISED BIBLIOGRAPHIES AS THEY DO TO THE NATIONALBIBLIOGRAPHY.
4946|PHOTOCOPYING EQUIPMENT).D     ISCUSSES SOME OF THE TRENDS IN THE PHOTOCOPIER MARKET, SUCH AS THE GROWTH INPLAIN PAPER COPIERS WITH FALLING PRICES ALONG WITH A REDUCTION IN SIZE ANDWEIGHT AND THE INCLUSION OF REFINEMENTS DUE TO SOLID STATE ELECTRONICS ANDFIBRE OPTICS.

DISCUSSES BRIEFLY THE 1976| US COPYRIGHT LAW WHICHDEALS WITH THE NEW AGE OF ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY AND COMPUTER APPLICATIONS.CONSIDERS SOME OF THE PROPOSALS OF THE WHITFORD COMMITTEE ON COPYRIGHT, ANDARGUES THAT URGENT ACTION IS REQUIRED TO BRING IN A NEW COPYRIGHT STATUTE INTHE UK BEFORE THE SITUATION DETERIORATES ANY FURTHER.
4949|CHILDREN'S CULTURE IN DELHI.     DESCRIBES THE CHILDREN'S BOOK TRUST IN NEW DELHI, A PUBLISHING HOUSE FORCHILDREN, SET UP BY YAMUNA SHANKAR IN 1957| WITH THE AIM OF PRODUCING HIGHQUALITY, LOW PRICED CHILDREN'S BOOKS. BOOKS ARE PUBLISHED IN ENGLISH, HINDIAND 5| OTHER LANGUAGES; LOSSES ARE FINANCED BY OTHER PRINTING BUSINESS. THESUBJECTS ARE MOSTLY INDIAN MYTHOLOGY AND HISTORY, AND, RECENTLY, POPULARSCIENCE. OTHER ACTIVITIES INCLUDE' WRITERS' WORKSHOPS, A MAGAZINE 2|CHILDREN'SWORLD1|, DRAWING COMPETITIONS FOR CHILDREN, FILM FESTIVALS, BOOK FAIRS, AND ADOLLS' MUSEUM. THE TRUST ALSO RUNS A LIBRARY WITH TOYS, GAMES, AND 25|,000|BOOKS FOR CHILDREN AGED 5|-16|. THE EFFORTS OF THE TRUST ARE PRAISEWORTHY, BUTAMOUNT TO LITTLE IN A COUNTRY WHERE POVERTY AND ILLITERACY PREVAIL. MOREUNORTHODOX MEDIA THAN THE WRITTEN WORD SHOULD BE ATTEMPTED.
4950|THE INVOLVEMENT OF MULTINATIONAL COMPANIES IN THE BOOK INDUSTRY IN BRAZIL.     TRANSLATION FROM ENGLISH. MULTINATIONAL COMPANIES HAVE BEEN PROMINENT INBRAZIL IN ALL FIELDS OF INDUSTRY AND COMMERCE SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THECENTURY; THEIR INVOLVEMENT IN PUBLISHING BEGAN TO INCREASE NOTABLY WITH THEEXPANSION OF HIGHER EDUCATION AT THE END OF THE 1950|S. THE PROGRESSIVE STAGESOF GROWTH UP TO THE PRESENT ARE DESCRIBED, WITH DETAILS OF THE VARIOUS WAYS INWHICH SUCH COMPANIES HAVE PENETRATED THE BOOK INDUSTRY AND PROTECTIVELEGISLATION DESIGNED TO ENCOURAGE NATIONAL COMPANIES. BRAZILIAN FIRMS AREMAINLY HAMPERED BY LACK OF CAPITAL; STRATEGIES USED TO CIRCUMVENT THIS PROBLEMARE DISCUSSED.

EACH TITLE CAN BE ASSESSED INRELATION TO THE OTHERS AND THE DATA FOR ALL TITLES CAN BE CUMULATED SO THATDECISIONS CAN BE MADE AT VARIOUS CUTOFF POINTS. SIMPLE RANKING OF TITLES BYRAW USE (RUR) MAY BE INADEQUATE AND SHOULD BE ADJUSTED BY SOME MEASURE TOALLOW FOR HOW MUCH OF THE TITLE IS AVAILABLE TO THE USER AT THE TIME OF THECOLLECTION OF THE USE DATA. IF THE RAW-USE FREQUENCY OF A TITLE IS DIVIDED BYTHE ACTUAL LINEAR SHELF SPACE OF THE TITLE'S FILE, A 'DENSITY-OF-USE'FREQUENCY IS OBTAINED. IF THESE FREQUENCIES ARE THEN RANKED, A 'DENSITY-OF-USERANK' (DUR) IS FORMED. SOME DIFFERENCES BETWEEN RUR AND DUR HAVE BEENANALYSED.

THE INFORMATION SHOULDINCLUDE' THE DATE OF RECORDING; THE PLACE OF RECORDING; NAMES OF PUBLISHERS,ARRANGERS AND STATEMENTS ON ABBREVIATIONS OR DEVIATIONS IN THE SCORE; NAMES OFPERFORMERS; PLAYING TIME FOR EACH SECTION; NAMES OF CONDUCTORS, SOUNDENGINEERS AND PRODUCERS. THE AGREEMENT IS BEING DISCUSSED WITH MANUFACTURERSIN GERMANY, FRANCE, SCANDINAVIA AND THE UK.
5101|ORAL ARCHIVES' SOME REFLECTIONS ON CREATING THEM.DESCRIBES METHODS USED IN THE PRIVATE ARCHIVES DEPARTMENT OF THE FRENCHNATIONAL ARCHIVES FOR RECORDING ORAL TESTIMONIES. DETAILS ARE GIVEN OF THEEQUIPMENT USED, WITH PRACTICAL ADVICE ON CONDUCTING INTERVIEWS TO ENSURE GOODQUALITY RECORDINGS, AND RELEVANT CONTENT WITH MINIMUM FATIGUE FOR THEPARTICIPANTS. THE ESSENTIAL PRELIMINARY DATA TO BE RECORDED ON EVERY TAPE FORARCHIVE IDENTIFICATION ARE LISTED. THE IMPORTANCE OF ORAL TESTIMONIES INSUPPLEMENTING AND EXPLAINING THE CONTENTS OF TRADITIONAL ARCHIVES ISILLUSTRATED HERE WITH REFERENCE TO A SERIES OF INTERVIEWS RECORDED FROMDESCENDANTS OF FRENCH POLITICIANS IN THE COURSE OF A SURVEY OF THEIR PERSONALPAPERS.
5102|LIBRARIES AND COMPUTER MATERIALS.THE SEMINAR HELD AT DORKING, 13|-14| MAR 81|, DISCUSSED THE IMPLICATIONS FORLIBRARIES OF THE RAPID GROWTH IN THE SCOPE AND VARIETY OF COMPUTER MATERIALS,ESPECIALLY MICROCOMPUTER SOFTWARE. EXPLORED THE POSSIBLE CONTRIBUTIONS OF THELIBRARY/INFORMATION PROFESSIONS TO SOLVING THE PROBLEMS OF CATALOGUING,INDEXING AND RETRIEVING INFORMATION ABOUT SUCH MATERIALS.
5103|NORTH AFRICAN JEWISH PERIODICALS AS A FIELD OF STUDY-THE STATE OF THE ART.THE AUTHOR RECENTLY COMPILED AN INVENTORY OF NORTH AFRICAN JEWISH PERIODICALSFOUND IN 4| MAJOR JERUSALEM COLLECTIONS. WHILE PREPARING THIS 1|ST LISTING OF145| TITLES, HE ENCOUNTERED SEVERAL PROBLEMS, WHICH HE SHARES WITH LIBRARIANS.FIRSTLY, THERE WERE OFTEN DISCREPANCIES BETWEEN HOLDINGS LISTED IN THECATALOGUE AND ACTUAL COLLECTIONS, WHICH ONLY A FIRST-HAND CHECK OF EACH ISSUECOULD RECTIFY. MOREOVER, THE CATALOGUE IS NOT A SATISFACTORY SOURCE FORCHANGES OF EDITORS, MANAGERS-OR EVEN SUBTITLES AND OTHER TITLES (OFTENAPPEARING IN OTHER LANGUAGES). THE CENTRAL ZIONIST ARCHIVES POSED A SPECIALPROBLEM' NEWSPAPERS AS A RULE ARE TRANSFERRED TO ITS LIBRARY COLLECTION, BUTSOME ISSUES OF SHORT-LIVED ZIONIST PERIODICALS WERE APPENDED TO CORRESPONDENCEAND REMAIN IN THE ARCHIVAL COLLECTION, WITHOUT BEING LISTED IN THE LIBRARYCATALOGUE.
5104|THE DEVELOPMENT AND DISSEMINATION OF GERMAN AND FOREIGN LANGUAGE LITERATUREFOR CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE; SELECTED EXAMPLES. PART 2|.A DETAILED DESCRIPTION IS GIVEN OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF CHILDREN'S LITERATURE INTHE USA, THE HIGH STANDARDS OF RESEARCH INTO THE SUBJECT AND THE CONCERN TORAISE THE STANDARD OF CHILDREN'S LITERATURE. THE CHILDREN'S SERVICE DIVISIONOF THE AMERICAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION HAS ORGANISED SERVICES TO HELP THEBACKWARD AND UNDERPRIVILEGED BY BRINGING THEM INTO CONTACT WITH GOODLITERATURE. THE BEST BIBLIOGRAPHIES AND OTHER REFERENCE BOOKS ON THE SUBJECTARE DISCUSSED. BRIEFER SURVEYS ARE ALSO INCLUDED ON THE PUBLISHING OFCHILDREN'S LITERATURE, PAST AND PRESENT, AND ON LIBRARY WORK WITH CHILDREN INCANADA, SWEDEN, PANAMA, SPAIN, BRAZIL, CHILE, AUSTRALIA, EGYPT, GHANA, ISRAELAND TURKEY. FOR PART 1|, 2|SEE1| 82|/5467|.
5105|NORMS AND FUNCTIONS IN CITATION' THE VIEW OF JOURNAL EDITORS AND REFEREES INPSYCHOLOGY.THE VIEWS OF PSYCHOLOGY JOURNAL EDITORS AND EDITORIAL ADVISORY BOARD MEMBERSWERE SOUGHT ON THE NATURE AND FUNCTIONS OF CITATION. INFORMATION WAS GATHEREDUSING AN 18| ITEM QUESTIONNAIRE. THE FEELING EMERGED THAT CITATION WAS A SKILLWHICH AUTHORS ACQUIRED OSMOTICALLY. CONSIDERABLE SUPPORT WAS GIVEN TO THE IDEATHAT EDITORS AND REFEREES COULD PLAY A MORE POSITIVE ROLE IN ESTABLISHING ANDENCOURAGING CONSISTENCY IN AUTHORS' CITATION PRACTICES. WHERE APPROPRIATE,REPLIES HAVE BEEN INTERPRETED IN THE LIGHT OF PREVAILING THEORY. PRACTICALREASONS FOR FURTHER RESEARCH IN THIS AREA ARE ALSO CONSIDERED.
5106|THE CODEX CAESAREUS UPSALIENSIS.DESCRIBES A MANUSCRIPT, CONTAINING THE 4| GOSPELS IN LATIN WHICH WAS PRODUCEDIN 1050| BY THE MONASTERY OF ECHTERNACH ON THE ORDER OF EMPEROR HENRY III ANDTHEN SENT TO THE MONASTERY OF GOSLAR; IN 1632|, DURING THE 30| YEARS' WAR, ITWAS TAKEN AS WAR BOOTY TO SWEDEN AND IN 1805| WAS GIVEN TO UPPSALA UNIVERSITY.IN 1971| A FACSIMILE EDITION OF 500| COPIES WAS PRODUCED TO CELEBRATE THE 350|THANNIVERSARY OF UPPSALA UNIVERSITY LIBRARY. A DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THEPRODUCTION METHODS FOR THESE FACSIMILES IS INCLUDED. EACH COPY IS ACCOMPANIEDBY A COMPREHENSIVE ESSAY ON THE MANUSCRIPT BY CARL NORDENFALK, ANINTERNATIONAL AUTHORITY ON MEDIEVAL MANUSCRIPTS.
5107|SOUND CASSETTES IN THE LIBRARY. (IV) RELIGIOUS CASSETTES IN THE LIBRARY.THE RANGE OF CASSETTES ON RELIGIOUS SUBJECTS AVAILABLE ON THE MARKET ISRELATIVELY SMALL. SOME RELIGIOUS MATERIAL IS ONLY AVAILABLE ON RECORDS, WHICHARE LESS USEFUL THAN CASSETTES IN LIBRARIES, BUT THE PRODUCTS OF A FEWIMPORTANT MANUFACTURERS SHOULD FORM THE BASIS OF A LIBRARY'S STOCK.MANUFACTURERS' LISTS PROVIDE THE ONLY SOURCE OF INFORMATION FOR THE LIBRARIANSINCE NO COMPREHENSIVE TOPICAL INDEX OF RELIGIOUS CASSETTES EXISTS. CASSETTEMATERIAL AVAILABLE IN GERMANY CONTAINING BIBLE READINGS AND DRAMATISATIONS,TALKS ON THE CATHOLIC FAITH, THE CHRISTIAN WAY OF LIFE, MEDITATION AND PRAYERIS DESCRIBED. EACH CASSETTE SHOULD BE EXAMINED INDIVIDUALLY CONCERNING ITSSUBJECT CONTENT, AIMS, SUITABILITY FOR THE TARGET GROUP AND THE QUALITY OFMUSIC, LANGUAGE AND TECHNICAL PRODUCTION. (FOR PREVIOUS PARTS, SEE 82|/5287|,82|/5291| AND 82|/5288|).
5108|THE LOMENIE DE BRIENNE COLLECTION AND OTHER FRENCH LEGAL DOCUMENTS AT HARVARD.BRIEFLY DESCRIBES HOLDINGS IN HARVARD UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES OF HISTORICALFRENCH LEGAL DOCUMENTS, INCLUDING THE LOMENIE DE BRIENNE COLLECTION, ANDCATALOGUES OF THE HOLDINGS. SUGGESTS THAT THESE DOCUMENTS SERVED A NEWSFUNCTION AND WERE DISTRIBUTED OUTSIDE LEGAL CIRCLES.
5109|CENTRALISATION AND TREATMENT OF MAIL, DOCUMENTATION, INFORMATION AND ARCHIVES'THE EXPERIENCE OF THE GENEVA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS.AN ACCOUNT OF THE PROCEDURES ADOPTED FOLLOWING THE CONCENTRATION OF ALLSERVICES IN ONE BUILDING. DETAILS ARE GIVEN OF THE SYSTEM EVOLVED FOR HANDLINGBOTH CURRENT AND SPECIAL MAIL, SPECIFYING ROUTINES FOR DEALING WITHCOMMUNICATIONS FROM STATE DEPARTMENTS; THE TASKS ASSIGNED TO THE DOCUMENTATIONCENTRE; AND ARCHIVE OPERATIONS IN RELATION TO SUBJECT FIELDS COVERED, SHOWINGHOW UDC IS USED. ARCHIVE CRITERIA FOR CONSERVATION AND DESTRUCTION OFDOCUMENTS, AND USE OF MICROFILMING, ARE DESCRIBED, AND CATALOGUING TECHNIQUESAND EQUIPMENT USED FOR 16|MM MICROFILMING SPECIFIED. RELEVANT STANDARDDOCUMENTATION RELATING TO ALL ASPECTS OF THE SERVICES IS APPENDED TOILLUSTRATE THE SYSTEM.
5110|AUTHOR COCITATION: A LITERATURE MEASURE OF INTELLECTUAL STRUCTURE.SHOWS THAT THE MAPPING OF A PARTICULAR AREA OF SCIENCE, IN THIS CASEINFORMATION SCIENCE, CAN BE DONE USING AUTHORS AS UNITS OF ANALYSIS AND THECOCITATIONS OF PAIRS OF AUTHORS AS THE VARIABLE THAT INDICATES THEIR'DISTANCES' FROM EACH OTHER. THE ANALYSIS ASSUMES THAT THE MORE 2| AUTHORS ARECITED TOGETHER, THE CLOSER THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THEM. THE RAW DATA ARECOCITATION COUNTS DRAWN ON-LINE FROM SOCIAL SCISEARCH (2|SOCIAL SCIENCESCITATION INDEX1|) OVER THE PERIOD 1972|-79|. COCITATION ANALYSIS OF AUTHORSOFFERS A NEW TECHNIQUE THAT MIGHT CONTRIBUTE TO THE UNDERSTANDING OFINTELLECTUAL STRUCTURE IN THE SCIENCES AND POSSIBLY IN OTHER AREAS TO THEEXTENT THAT THOSE AREAS RELY ON SERIAL PUBLICATIONS.
5111|COINCIDENCE METHODS AND THE TWO-LEVEL CONCEPT.COINCIDENCE METHODS ARE APPLIED TO INVESTIGATIONS INTO RANK DISTRIBUTION INTHE REPORT LITERATURE OF THE INTERNATIONAL NUCLEAR INFORMATION SYSTEM (INIS)AND A 2|-LEVEL CONCEPT USED FOR DISCUSSION OF RESULTS IN THE PRESENT ANDPREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS. TRANSITIONS BETWEEN MACRO AND MICRO INFORMATIONLEVELS, WITH REFERENCE TO CONSTANT FORMS OF COMMUNICATION, ARE COMPARED WITHEACH OTHER AS WELL AS TRANSITIONS BETWEEN DIFFERENT FORMS OF COMMUNICATION ATCONSTANT LEVELS. THE DISAPPEARANCE OF THE 'INFORMATION AVALANCHE' FOR THEHIGHLY SPECIALISED INFORMATION SCIENTIST, THE GREATER EFFECTIVITY OF REPORTLITERATURE AS COMPARED WITH PERIODICAL LITERATURE IN THE FIELDS OF NUCLEARRESEARCH AND THE NONCOMPATIBILITY OF MACRO AND MICRO INFORMATION LEVELS CAN BEQUANTITATIVELY CONFIRMED. THE QUESTION REMAINS, HOW MICROLEVEL DISTRIBUTIONCAN BE CHANGED INTO MACROLEVEL DISTRIBUTION.
5112|PATTERNS OF JOURNAL USE IN A DEPARTMENTAL LIBRARY' A CITATION ANALYSIS.CITATION ANALYSIS OF FACULTY PUBLICATIONS, DOCTORAL DISSERTATIONS, ANDPRELIMINARY DOCTORAL QUALIFYING BRIEFS PRODUCED BY FACULTY AND STUDENTS OF THEBIOLOGY DEPARTMENT, TEMPLE UNIVERSITY, IS USED TO ASSESS JOURNAL USE IN THEBIOLOGY LIBRARY DURING THE YEARS 1975|-77|. THERE ARE 3|,739| CITATIONS TO 336|JOURNALS IN THE COMBINED SOURCES RANKING. THE DISTRIBUTION OF CITATIONS INEACH USER GROUP RANKING AND THE COMBINED SOURCES RANKING TAKES THE FORM OF ABRADFORD DISTRIBUTION. 60| HIGHLY CITED TITLES ARE EXAMINED IN DETAIL.DISSERTATION CITATIONS ARE DEPENDENT ON ACTIVE FACULTY PARTICIPATION IN THEDOCTORAL PROGRAMME. CITATIONS IN QUALIFYING BRIEFS COVER A BROADER RANGE OFTOPICS AND INTERESTS THAN EITHER OF THE OTHER 2| SOURCES. CITATION FREQUENCIESOF VOLUMES PUBLISHED IN THE PERIODS 1960|-69| AND 1970|-77| ARE EXAMINED. SEVERALCOLLECTION MAINTENANCE AND DEVELOPMENT DECISIONS HAVE BEEN MADE, BASED ON THERESULTS OF THIS STUDY. CITATION ANALYSIS IS SHOWN TO BE A USEFUL TOOL INASSESSING ACTUAL AND POTENTIAL JOURNAL USE BY A HETEROGENEOUS CLIENTELE IN ADEPARTMENTAL LIBRARY.
5113|THE USE OF PERIODICAL LITERATURE IN A NORWEGIAN DENTAL LIBRARY.PERIODICAL LOANS, PHOTOCOPY REQUESTS, AND READING ROOM USE OF BACK VOLUMES OFPERIODICALS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF BERGEN DENTAL SCHOOL LIBRARY WERE REGISTEREDDURING A 12| MONTH PERIOD. LOANS WERE SORTED BY TITLE AND YEAR, AND TITLES WEREGROUPED BY SPECIALITY AND LANGUAGE. TOTAL BORROWING WAS 2|,242| AND THE ANNUALAGING FACTOR WAS 0|.89| (HALF-LIFE 5|.8| YEARS). 12| PERIODICALS ACCOUNTED FOR 50|%OF TOTAL BORROWING. WHILE MOST SPECIALISED DENTAL JOURNALS HAD A LOWER AGINGFACTOR THAN DENTAL JOURNALS AS A WHOLE, ORTHODONTIC JOURNALS HAD AN AGINGFACTOR OF 0|.92| (HALF-LIFE 8|.7| YEARS). NON-ENGLISH LANGUAGE JOURNALS ACCOUNTEDFOR 22|% OF BORROWING, SCANDINAVIAN LANGUAGE TITLES (16|% OF BORROWING) HAD ALOWER AGING FACTOR (0|.87|, HALF-LIFE 5|.1| YEARS) AND SEEMED TO BE USED MORE ASNEWS JOURNALS.
5114|BULGARIAN AND FOREIGN LITERATURE ON ENERGY IN THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OFBULGARIA.A CRITICAL APPRAISAL OF LITERATURE ON ENERGY, AVAILABLE AT PRESENT, INBULGARIAN LIBRARIES. ALL POSSIBLE ASPECTS ARE COVERED. FOREIGN PUBLICATIONS INTHIS IMPORTANT FIELD WERE PREDOMINANTLY FRENCH AND GERMAN IN THE 1940|S, BUTNOWADAYS, 60|% IS WRITTEN IN RUSSIAN FOLLOWED BY MATERIALS IN ENGLISH. DURINGTHE PAST 20| YEARS, EVEN THE CENTRAL REGIONAL LIBRARIES HAVE ESTABLISHEDSPECIAL COLLECTIONS ON ENERGY. MAJOR LIBRARIES HAVE SPECIALISED IN 3| AREAS.FIRSTLY, THE CENTRAL TECHNICAL LIBRARY AND THE LIBRARY OF THE BULGARIANACADEMY OF SCIENCES HAVE BUILT UP THEORETICAL COLLECTIONS AND OTHERS OFSPECIALIST INTEREST, E.G. ON NUCLEAR ENERGY. SECONDLY, REFERENCE PUBLICATIONSARE TO BE FOUND MAINLY AT THE CYRIL AND METHODIUS NATIONAL LIBRARY WHILETHIRDLY TECHNICAL COLLEGES AND OTHER ESTABLISHMENTS OF HIGHER TECHNICALEDUCATION CONCENTRATE ON ALL ASPECTS OF ELECTRICAL POWER, INSTALLATIONS,INSTRUMENTS, AND SO ON. IN ALL LIBRARIES, THE STAFF RESPONSIBLE FOR NEWACQUISITIONS MUST BEAR IN MIND THE LATEST TRENDS, E.G. CONVERSION OF CHEMICALENERGY INTO LIGHT, WHERE, SO FAR, THE LITERATURE AVAILABLE IS ALMOSTNEGLIGIBLE.
5115|THE UNIVERSITY IS A SCHOOL OF READING.STUDENTS AT THE STUDENCHESKOE KONSTRUKTORSKOE BYURO AVIAMODELIZMA, (STUDENTS'AIRCRAFT MODELLING CONSTRUCTION BUREAU), START BY READING THE LITERATURE ON APROBLEM; THE ROAD TO SCIENCE STARTS IN THE LIBRARY. THE UNIVERSITY COURSE ONSTUDENTS' EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH WORK INCULCATES THE READING HABIT, INDEPENDENTWORK WITH BOOKS. FOR BEST RESULTS STUDENTS SHOULD ABSTRACT THE IMPORTANT PARTSOF THEIR READING, THINKING IT OVER UNHURRIEDLY. CREATIVE INTERACTION WITH THETEXT IS MOST IMPORTANT. AFTER LECTURES, THE NEXT STAGE IS THE LIBRARY,FOLLOWING UP POINTS MADE IN THE LECTURES. TACTFUL LIBRARIANS HELP READERSCHOOSE A BOOK AT THEIR LEVEL OF COMPETENCE AND, IN A SHORT CONVERSATION, CANAROUSE STRONG INTEREST IN A BOOK OR, CONVERSELY, SWITCH A READER OVER TO ANALTERNATIVE CHOICE.
5116|THE FILMING OF COMPLETE MUSICAL STOCKS OF HISTORICAL IMPORTANCE IN SMALLERLIBRARIES NOT GENERALLY OPEN TO THE PUBLIC, CARRIED OUT BY THE GERMAN MUSICHISTORY ARCHIVE IN KASSEL.MUCH OF THE VALUABLE OLD MANUSCRIPT AND PRINTED MUSIC IN GERMANY IS NOT OWNEDBY THE STATE AND ONLY FOUND IN SMALL ARCHIVES IN CASTLES, MONASTERIES,CHURCHES AND SCHOOLS. WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF THE VOLKSWAGEN FOUNDATION, THEARCHIVE IS WORKING IN NORTH GERMANY, MICROFILMING THESE MUSICAL TREASURES,CATALOGUING THEM AND THEN MAKING THEM AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC. IMPORTANTCOLLECTIONS RECENTLY COVERED INCLUDE' MUSIC IN LUBECK PUBLIC LIBRARY FROM THE17|TH CENTURY NORTH GERMAN SCHOOL OF ORGAN MUSIC AND ITS 18|TH CENTURYSUCCESSORS; 18|TH CENTURY MUSIC BELONGING TO A NOBLE FAMILY IN EUTIN; 17|TH AND18|TH CENTURY MUSIC IN A SCHOOL IN JEVER. THESE COLLECTIONS HAVE BEENMICROFILMED AND ARE NOW BEING CATALOGUED.
5117|THE HANDICAPPED AND MUSIC: THE ROLE OF MUSIC LIBRARIES?.THE DISABLED LIVING FOUNDATION HAS WORKED CLOSELY WITH UK MUSIC LIBRARIES INRECENT YEARS TO PROVIDE AN ADVISORY SERVICE ON MUSIC FOR THE HANDICAPPED;DANISH MUSIC LIBRARIES ARE ALSO ACTIVE IN THIS SPHERE. THE 60| MUSIC LIBRARIESIN GERMANY HAVE SO FAR DONE LITTLE FOR THE HANDICAPPED; THEY SHOULD OBTAIN ALLAVAILABLE INFORMATION FROM THE UK AND DISCUSS WITH LIBRARIANSHIP ANDGOVERNMENT BODIES THE ADAPTATION OF THE UK SCHEME FOR GERMANY. THE GERMANLIBRARY INSTITUTE COULD ORGANISE A PILOT PROJECT FOR 1983|-84|. TOPICS TO BECONSIDERED INCLUDE THE PROVISION OF MUSIC IN HOSPITALS, DAY CENTRES ANDSCHOOLS, THE USE OF MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS BY THE HANDICAPPED, THE PRODUCTION OFBIBLIOGRAPHIES, THE IMPROVEMENT OF SPECIAL LIBRARY SERVICES AND EMPLOYMENTPOSSIBILITIES FOR THE HANDICAPPED IN THE MUSIC INDUSTRY.
5118|WHAT BOOKS DO PEOPLE NEED?.SINCE LIBRARIANS THEMSELVES ARE WELL EDUCATED, THERE IS ALWAYS A DANGER THATTHEY MAY CATER SOLELY FOR THE WISHES OF AN ELITE MINORITY AND, BY EXCLUDINGEPHEMERAL LITERATURE FROM STOCK, DISCOURAGE MANY OTHER PEOPLE FROM USING THELIBRARY. THE WEST GERMAN NATIONAL LIBRARY PLAN OF 1973| STATES CLEARLY THATLIBRARIES MUST CATER FOR EVERYONE, EVEN IF PROBLEMS ARE CAUSED BY LIMITEDBUDGETS. IT IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT EMPHEMERAL LITERATURE HAS A RELAXINGEFFECT ON MANY PEOPLE, IN CONTRAST TO THE STIMULATING EFFECT CAUSED BY MOREDEMANDING WORKS. A POSSIBLE SOLUTION WOULD BE TO EXCLUDE LESS VALUABLEMATERIAL, SUCH AS WORKS INVOLVING PORNOGRAPHY AND VIOLENCE AND THEN TO INCLUDESOME TRIVIA IF CAREFUL ANALYSIS OF READER STRUCTURE DEMANDS IT.
5119|HOW CAN YOUR SON BECOME A READER?.THE MOSCOW AND TUL'SK PAEDAGOGIC INSTITUTES RECENTLY INVESTIGATEDSCHOOLCHILDREN'S WANING INTEREST IN FICTION AND FOUND ELEMENTARYSCHOOLCHILDREN READ LITTLE AND WERE INDIFFERENT TO FICTION. THEEXTRA-CURRICULAR READING PROJECT FOR 1|ST TO 3|RD FORMS EVOLVED. HERE CHILDRENLEARN TO EXAMINE BOOKS CAREFULLY BEFORE DECIDING ON SELECTION. AFTER 6| MONTHSOF THIS INSTRUCTION, 65|% OF 1|ST-FORMERS WERE QUICKLY ABLE TO FIND THE BOOKSREQUIRED. THE METHOD IS SUPPLEMENTED BY READING ALOUD STORIES ABOUT THE TEXT,LITERARY GAMES, COMPETITIONS, ETC. THE AIM IS TO FAMILIARISE 1|ST TO3|RD-FORMERS WITH SOME OF THE BEST RUSSIAN, SOVIET AND FOREIGN LITERATURE.LIBRARIANS SHOULD CONSOLIDATE ON THESE EARLIEST SCHOOL READING HABITS. SCHOOLLIBRARY COORDINATION IS NECESSARY.
5120|POPULATION AND ITS STRUCTURAL COMPOSITION AS THE DETERMINING FACTOR FORLOCATION OF LIBRARIES AND THEIR WORK.A THOROUGH ANALYSIS OF THE 1980| POPULATION CENSUS AS TO CHANGES IN DENSITY,SEX, AGE, EMPLOYMENT AND NATIONALITY, MAINLY IN THE SLOVAK SOCIALIST REPUBLIC,OFFERING IT AS A BASIS FOR THE FUTURE PLANNING OF LIBRARIES.
5121|THE PLANNABLE AND UNPLANNABLE (1|)' LIBRARIES AS THE INFRASTRUCTURE OFPRESERVATION AND CHANGE.LECTURE GIVEN AT THE ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE GERMAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION ANDTHE ASSOCIATION OF LIBRARIANS IN NORTH RHINE-WESTPHALIA, OCT 80|. LIBRARYSERVICES MUST REACT AND DEVELOP IN RELATION TO SOCIAL CHANGE. THEY MUST CATERFOR THE NEEDS OF BOTH URBAN AND RURAL COMMUNITIES, WHERE TOWN AND COUNTRYPLANNING HAS SO OFTEN FAILED. WORKING HOURS ARE SHORTER NOW THAN IN THE PAST,SO LIBRARIES MUST DEVELOP FACILITIES FOR EDUCATIONAL AND RECREATIONAL READINGIN CONJUNCTION WITH THE MASS MEDIA. CHILDREN USE LIBRARIES MORE THAN ADULTSBUT THE BIRTH RATE HAS FALLEN AND THERE ARE MORE ELDERLY PEOPLE IN THECOMMUNITY TODAY THAN BEFORE; THIS, HOWEVER, IS NO EXCUSE FOR A DECLINE INLIBRARY STANDARDS. LIBRARIES MUST BECOME COMMUNICATION CENTRES, IN PARTICULARTO HELP THE MANY PEOPLE LIVING ALONE AND THE 4| MILLION FOREIGNERS IN WESTGERMANY.
5122|THE PLANNABLE AND UNPLANNABLE (II)' LIBRARIES AS THE INFRASTRUCTURE OFPRESERVATION AND CHANGE.LECTURE GIVEN AT THE ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE GERMAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION ANDTHE ASSOCIATION OF LIBRARIANS IN NORTH RHINE-WESTPHALIA, BIELEFELD, OCT 80|.(FOR PART 1|, 2|SEE1| PREVIOUS ABSTRACT). LIBRARIES EXIST TO FULFIL HUMAN NEEDSFOR EDUCATION, INFORMATION, COMMUNICATION AND GENERAL SELF-DEVELOPMENT. FUTURELIBRARY PLANNING MUST PAY MORE ATTENTION TO THE BALANCE OF STATIONARY ANDMOBILE ELEMENTS IN A SYSTEM, TO LOCAL NEEDS AND TO ADULT EDUCATION. BOTHQUALIFIED LIBRARIANS AND VOLUNTARY HELPERS CAN MAKE VALUABLE CONTRIBUTIONS TOLIBRARY SERVICES; STAFF OF HIGH CALIBRE ARE MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE MEDIATHEMSELVES OR ADVANCED TECHNICAL EQUIPMENT. TOO MUCH TECHNOLOGY IN A LIBRARYCAN ALIENATE THE READERS. IT IS DIFFICULT TO GENERALISE ABOUT MINIMUMSTANDARDS; EACH LIBRARY NEEDS ITS OWN IDENTITY.
5123|THE INNOVATION MOVEMENT IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES 1981|-85|.UNDER THE AEGIS OF THE EAST GERMAN MINISTRY OF CULTURE, DAS ZENTRALINSTITUTFUR BIBLIOTHEKSWESEN (CENTRAL INSTITUTE FOR LIBRARY SCIENCE) IS ORGANISING APROGRAMME ENCOURAGING LIBRARY STAFF TO DEVISE NEW TECHNICAL AIDS, WORKPROCESSES AND ECONOMIC MEASURES. EXPERIENCE HAS SHOWN THAT SUCH INNOVATIONSCAN BE APPLIED ON A SCALE MUCH WIDER THAN THAT OF THE ORIGINAL CONCEPT,DETERMINING FACTORS BEING THE CONDITIONS, STRUCTURE AND TECHNICAL LEVEL OFEACH LIBRARY. THE INNOVATION DOES NOT HAVE TO BE A NEW INVENTION BUT SHOULDRATHER BE A BETTER USE OF EXISTING MATERIAL OR IDEAS. THOSE TESTING THEINNOVATIONS MUST HAVE A GOOD KNOWLEDGE OF THEIR SUBJECT. MORE PARTICIPATIONMUST BE ENCOURAGED FROM THE YOUNG STAFF MEMBERS.
5124|A GLOOMY OUTLOOK FOR LIBRARIES?.PUBLIC LIBRARY DEVELOPMENT HAS HALTED AT A POINT WHEN, BECAUSE OF THERECESSION, LIBRARY SERVICES ARE PARTICULARLY NECESSARY. CURRENT ECONOMICMEASURES HAVE HIT LIBRARIES HARD. SOME PEOPLE NOW REGARD INFORMATION ASMERCHANDISE FOR WHICH A SUITABLE MARKET PRICE MUST BE OBTAINED; THIS INCREASESTHE RISK OF INFORMATION SERVICES BEING TAKEN OVER BY PRIVATE COMPANIES, WHICHCOULD LEAD TO REDUCTIONS IN STATE BUDGETS. THE RAPID DEVELOPMENT OFINFORMATION TECHNOLOGY THREATENS TO BYPASS THE LIBRARY SERVICE AND BECAUSE OFTHE COMPETITIVE SITUATION ON THE INFORMATION MARKET LIBRARIES ARE BEING ASKEDTO RESTRICT THEMSELVES TO THEIR TRADITIONAL TASKS. LIBRARIES MUST MOBILISERESERVES HITHERTO UNUSED; REFUSING TO IMPLEMENT NEW METHODS OF LITERATUREPROVISION COULD HAVE DISASTROUS CONSEQUENCES. INITIAL ORGANISATIONAL PROBLEMSCAN BE OVERCOME THROUGH RATIONALISATION, CENTRALISATION AND WIDER USE OFELECTRONIC DATA PROCESSING.
5125|THE LIBRARY UNION IN HAMBURG.IN 1978| A COOPERATIVE SCHEME WAS INAUGURATED BETWEEN THE COMBINED STATE ANDUNIVERSITY LIBRARY AND OVER 100| INSTITUTE AND DEPARTMENTAL LIBRARIES OF THECOLLEGES OF TECHNOLOGY TO PRODUCE A UNION CATALOGUE AND ORGANISE COOPERATIVEPURCHASING OF BOOKS AND PERIODICALS. THE SCHEME HAS ALSO BEEN JOINED BY THETECHNICAL UNIVERSITY AT HAMBURG-HARBURG AND WILL ULTIMATELY INCLUDE OTHERLIBRARIES IN NORTH GERMANY. WORK ON THE UNION CATALOGUE HAS BEGUN WITH THEUNIVERSITY'S PERIODICALS, FOR WHICH ELECTRONIC DATA PROCESSING IS USED.CHANGES IN THE DATA PROCESSING SYSTEM WILL SHORTLY BE MADE AND MORE WORK ISNEEDED ON HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE. MORE SPACE AND MONEY WILL BE NEEDED AS THESCHEME EXPANDS.
5126|A NATIONWIDE NETWORK: WHICH SCENARIO IS BEST?.AN EDITED VERSION OF THE PAPER A NATIONWIDE NETWORK' DEVELOPMENT, GOVERNANCE,SUPPORT. THE PAPER HAS BEEN PREPARED BY THE US LIBRARY OF CONGRESS NETWORKADVISORY COMMITTEE AND IS A WORKING DOCUMENT INVITING COMMENT AND DISCUSSIONTHROUGHOUT THE LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SERVICE. IT OFFERS 3| SCENARIOS FOR THECONSTRUCTION OF A NATIONWIDE LIBRARY AND INFORMATION NETWORK' (1|) ALEGISLATIVE MODEL DEPENDENT ON CONGRESS TO MANDATE THE NETWORK AND PRESCRIBEITS GOVERNING STRUCTURE; (2|) AN EVOLUTIONARY MODEL RESULTING FROM 2|AD HOC1|AGREEMENTS; AND (3|) A PRIVATE SECTOR MODEL DEVELOPING FROM THE NON-PROFIT ANDFOR-PROFIT PRIVATE SYSTEMS IN RESPONSE TO DEMAND FROM THE MARKET PLACE.
5127|REGIONAL COOPERATION' SOME PRACTICAL DEVELOPMENTS.PAPER PRESENTED TO A MEETING OF THE WORKING PARTY ON PROVINCIAL CENTRALLIBRARIES IN DEVENTER, 19| NOV 81|. IN THE NETHERLANDS THE CUTBACKS IN LOCALGOVERNMENT FINANCES TOGETHER WITH THE GROWING DEMAND ON LIBRARIES FORTECHNICAL INFORMATION HAVE ENCOURAGED PUBLIC LIBRARIES TO COOPERATE WITH ONEANOTHER ON A REGIONAL BASIS TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY AND EFFICIENCY OF THEIRSERVICES. IN ADDITION THE EXPECTATION THAT THE EXISTING NETWORK OF LIBRARIESCHARGED WITH A REGIONAL SUPPORT FUNCTION WILL BE INCREASED, AND THEDECENTRALISATION OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT SERVICES AS PROPOSED IN THE NEW PUBLICSERVICES ACT, WILL FURTHER ENCOURAGE THIS TREND. HOWEVER, WHERE LIBRARIESENTER INTO SCHEMES OF COOPERATION THE NEEDS OF THEIR READERS SHOULD REMAIN THEPRIME CONSIDERATION.
5128|WASHINGTON COUNTY COOPERATIVE LIBRARY SERVICES NETWORK.OREGON'S WASHINGTON COUNTY COOPERATIVE LIBRARY SERVICES NETWORK BEGAN AS ANINFORMAL BASIS IN 1974| WITH A UNION LIST OF SERIALS FOR INTERLIBRARYBORROWING. THIS PROMPTED FUNDING FOR A STUDY OF COOPERATION AMONG LIBRARIES INTHE COUNTY. A STUDY BY PHYLLIS I. DALTON SET GUIDELINES FOR GETTING ACOOPERATIVE EFFORT GOING AND A PILOT PROJECT WAS BEGUN. PROGRAMMES INITIATEDINCLUDED' BOOKS-BY-MAIL; COUNTYWIDE COURIER SERVICE; BACK-UP REFERENCESERVICE; STORE-FRONT COMMUNITY LIBRARIES; AND A ROTATING CASSETTE PROGRAMME.TODAY WCCLS OPERATES ON A COUNTYWIDE SERIAL LEVY AND AWAITS AUTOMATION ANDCABLE TV AS THE ULTIMATE ANSWER TO A FULL COOPERATIVE EFFORT.
5129|RELATIONS WITH THE PUBLIC.EXAMINES THE USE OF PUBLIC RELATIONS BY LIBRARIES ILLUSTRATED WITH MANY USEXAMPLES OF BOTH INSIDE AND OUTSIDE LIBRARIES.
5130|YEAR FURTHER DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMME OF LIBRARY SERVICES IN WHITE RUSSIA.THE MAIN TRENDS OF THIS PROGRAMME ARE CONCERNED WITH' THE DEVELOPMENT OF ALIBRARY SYSTEM-THE CENTRALISATION OF STATE LIBRARIES WAS COMPLETED IN THE 10|TH5|-YEAR PLAN, THAT OF TRADE UNION LIBRARIES IS IN THE PROCESS OF COMPLETION.THE NEXT 5| YEARS WILL SEE THE CENTRALISATION OF SPECIALISED LIBRARIES, WITHLIBRARIES OF ALL TYPES FORMING 1| SYSTEM; READER SERVICES, EDUCATION TOWARDSCOMMUNIST IDEALS BEING THE PRIORITY; ORGANISATION OF SERVICES TO THECOMMUNITY-THIS SHOULD BE CONCERNED WITH EVERY LOCALITY, EVERY TOWN BOROUGH;INFORMATION AND BIBLIOGRAPHIC SERVICES, PRIORITY BEING GIVEN TO PARTY,IDEOLOGICAL AND CULTURAL WORKERS; LIBRARY STOCKS; AND RESEARCH ANDMETHODOLOGICAL WORK.
5131|NATIS' A CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK FOR MALAYSIA.DISCUSSES THE UNESCO INITIATED CONCEPT OF THE NATIONAL INFORMATION SYSTEM(NATIS), AND DEVELOPS A CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF NATIS INMALAYSIA. REVIEWS THE STEPS INVOLVED IN THE FORMULATION OF A NATIONALINFORMATION POLICY, AND DESCRIBES THE PROPOSED ORGANISATIONAL STRUCTURE OF THEMALAYSIAN NATIONAL INFORMATION SYSTEM. THIS WOULD CONSIST OF' A NATIONALINFORMATION COUNCIL; A SECRETARIAT; AND SECTORAL COORDINATORS.
5132|NEW HORIZONS IN LIBRARY DEVELOPMENT IN THE RSFSR.SUMMING UP THE WORK OF LIBRARIANSHIP IN THE LAST 5|-YEAR PLAN, AND LOOKINGFORWARD TO THE NEXT, IT IS POSSIBLE TO DISCERN 6| MAIN AREAS OF LIBRARYACTIVITY' THE COMPLETION OF CENTRALISATION; THE FURTHER IMPROVEMENT OF LIBRARYNETWORKS; THE RATIONAL EXPLOITATION OF STOCKS; THE BETTER TRAINING OF LIBRARYSTAFF; IMPROVING THE MATERIAL AND TECHNOLOGICAL BASE OF LIBRARIES; ANDDEVELOPING WORK WITH READERS. IT IS NECESSARY TO SET SPECIFIC GOALS FOR THENEW 5|-YEAR PLAN AND TO DRAW ON PAST EXPERIENCE TO HELP ACHIEVE THEM.
5133|STATISTICS AS BASIS FOR IMPROVEMENT OF THE QUALITY AND EFFICIENCY OF LIBRARYPROCESSES.AN IN-DEPTH ANALYSIS OF THE WORKING OF A LIBRARY OR A LIBRARY SYSTEM CAN BECARRIED OUT BY MEANS OF STATISTICAL DATA OBTAINED FROM THE WHOLE SPECTRUM OFITS ACTIVITIES. THESE CAN BE DIVIDED INTO' ACTIVITIES OF ITS ORGANISATIONALAND MATERIAL BASIS; WORK CONCERNING USERS; WORK RELATED TO LOANS. THE QUALITYOF WORK CAN THEN BE DETERMINED BY MEANINGFUL CORRELATION OF INDIVIDUAL DATAWITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF 1| OF THESE GROUPS, OR BETWEEN THE DATA AND INDEXES OF2| OR 3| GROUPS.
5134|LAW CONCERNING THE UNIFIED SYSTEM OF SOCIO-ECONOMIC INFORMATION AND LIBRARYSTATISTICS.IN 1971| THE FEDERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE CZECHOSLOVAK SOCIALIST REPUBLIC DECREED BYLAW THE FORMATION OF A UNIFIED SYSTEM OF SOCIO-ECONOMIC INFORMATION. ITSPRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS ARE INVESTIGATED HERE, MAINLY IN REGARD TO LIBRARYSTATISTICS PROVIDED WITHIN THE SYSTEM. AN IN-DEPTH ANALYSIS OF THE CURRENTSTATE OF LIBRARY AND INFORMATION CENTRE STATISTICS WAS CARRIED OUT IN 1979|; ITSHOWED MANY SHORTCOMINGS CONCERNING STATISTICAL INDEXES AND THEIR DEFINITION.AS A RESULT A UNIFIED STATISTICAL SYSTEM WAS INTRODUCED WHICH IS HEREDISCUSSED IN DETAIL.
5135|NATIONAL RANKINGS AS A MEANS OF EVALUATING MEDICAL SCHOOL LIBRARY PROGRAMS' ACOMPARATIVE STUDY.PRESENTS THE RESULTS OF A COMPARATIVE STUDY UNDERTAKEN TO ASSESS THE REASONSFOR THE LOW RANKINGS RECEIVED BY THE GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY MEDICALCENTER LIBRARY IN THE PUBLICATION 2|ANNUAL STATISTICS FOR MEDICAL SCHOOLLIBRARIES IN THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA1|. CONCLUDES THAT THE 2|ANNUALSTATISTICS1| AND OTHER TRADITIONAL MEASURES OF QUALITY ARE INAPPROPRIATE ANDINACCURATE MEASURES FOR EVALUATING LIBRARY PROGRAMMES, SINCE THEY ONLY MEASURERESOURCE ALLOCATIONS AND NOT THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THESE ALLOCATIONS. SUGGESTSSOME ALTERNATIVE EVALUATION METHODS.
5136|DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS IN LIBRARIES.FOLLOWING A REVIEW OF THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF COMPUTERS AND MANAGERIALSCIENCE/OPERATIONS RESEARCH TO THE MANAGEMENT OF LIBRARIES, THIS PAPERINTRODUCES THE CONCEPT OF DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS. DSS, A BLENDING OF THESETECHNIQUES, CAN LEAD TO MORE EFFECTIVE DECISIONS BY LIBRARY MANAGERS. A CASESTUDY OF THE UTILISATION OF A DSS IN THE BUDGETING PROCESS OF A MEDIUM SIZEDLIBRARY ILLUSTRATES THE PROCESS. REPORT NOT AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
5137|METHODOLOGICAL CENTRES AND THE CONTROL THEY EXERCISE OVER PUBLIC LIBRARIES.THE MINISTRY OF CULTURE OF THE SLOVAK SOCIALIST REPUBLIC HAS ASSIGNED TOMETHODOLOGICAL CENTRES THE TASK OF PARTICIPATING IN THE MANAGEMENT OF PUBLICLIBRARIES IN ALL ITS ASPECTS. THIS IS DONE BY INSPECTION, ADVICE AND FINALLYSUGGESTION OF SOLUTIONS TO THE LIBRARY'S MANAGEMENT PERSONNEL. THE SCOPE OFTHEIR AUTHORITY IS, HOWEVER, NOT QUITE CLEAR. DELEGATION OF GREATERINDEPENDENCE OF DECISION TO METHODOLOGICAL WORKERS IS DESIRABLE. SOLUTIONSSUGGESTED FOR METHODOLOGICAL APPROACH TO DISTRICT AND SIMILAR LIBRARIES AREEXPRESSED BY MEANS OF FLOW-CHARTS.
5138|INFORMATION AND BIBLIOGRAPHICAL REFERENCE WORK AT A NEW LEVEL IN CENTRALISEDSYSTEMS.CENTRALISED LIBRARY SYSTEMS HAVE RESPONDED IN A VARIETY OF WAYS TO THE CALLFOR GREATER DEVELOPMENT OF INFORMATION WORK. EXAMPLES FROM ALL OVER THE USSRSHOW HOW THEY HAVE UNDERTAKEN MORE BOOK PROMOTION AND INFORMATIONDISSEMINATION; ORGANISED SURVEYS TO ASCERTAIN THE INFORMATION NEEDS IN THEIRAREA; PAID PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO THE NEEDS OF AGRICULTURAL WORKERS; ANDESTABLISHED IMPORTANT LINKS WITH THE SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL INFORMATIONCENTRES AT REPUBLICAN LEVEL. PUBLIC LIBRARIES, MINDFUL OF THEIR ROLE TO SERVETHE WHOLE COMMUNITY, ARE ALSO TURNING THEIR ATTENTION TO THE NEEDS OFPOLITICAL WORKERS, TEACHERS AND OTHERS OUTSIDE THE SPHERE OF MATERIALPRODUCTION.
5139|SOME ISSUES IN PLANNING THE WORK OF CENTRALISED LIBRARY SYSTEMS.PLANNING IN THE WORK OF CENTRALISED LIBRARY SYSTEMS CAN BE SEEN AS THE METHODBY WHICH THE MOST FAVOURABLE CIRCUMSTANCES ARE CREATED FOR THE SATISFACTION OFTHE DEMANDS OF THE LOCAL POPULATION FOR BOOKS AND FOR INFORMATION. PLANNINGPROCEDURES HAVE HAD TO CHANGE SIGNIFICANTLY AS LIBRARIES HAVE COMBINED INTOCENTRALISED SYSTEMS AND RECENT EXPERIENCES FROM LIBRARIES FROM ALL OVER THEUSSR CAN BE COMPARED. THE INTRODUCTION OF LONG-TERM PLANNING IN THIS RESPECTIS PARTICULARLY RELEVANT.
5140|YOU TOO CAN BE A LIBRARY PLANNER-PART I.PART 1| OF A 2|-PART INTRODUCTION TO THE AMERICAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION MANUAL APLANNING PROCESS FOR PUBLIC LIBRARIES. THE KEY FEATURES OF THE ALA PROCESSWHICH IS SUITABLE FOR UK AND US PUBLIC LIBRARIES, ARE THAT IT IS FLEXIBLE,PARTICIPATIVE AND GOAL-ORIENTED. THE MANUAL'S 'PRIMARY CYCLE' IS DIVIDED INTO3| SUBCYCLES: THE TRAINING CYCLE; THE THINKING CYCLE; AND THE MEASURING CYCLE.DESCRIBES THE STEPS WHICH ARE NORMALLY THE SAME IN EACH SUBCYCLE. EMPHASISESTHE NEED FOR CONSULTATION WITH OTHER STAFF.
5141|YOU TOO CAN BE A LIBRARY PLANNER-PART II.PART II OF A 2|-PART INTRODUCTION TO THE AMERICAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION MANUAL 2|APLANNING PROCESS FOR PUBLIC LIBRARIES1| FOR MEMBERS OF PLANNING TEAMS USING THEALA PROCESS (FOR PART I, 2|SEE1| PRECEDING ABSTRACT). DISCUSSES THE LIBRARY AS APURPOSEFUL SYSTEM AND THE ROLE OF THE ABACON CHART. THE CHART CONSISTS OF ARECTANGULAR PLOT OF PREDICTED PERFORMANCE OF AN ALTERNATIVE FOR A PARTICULARGOAL AGAINST IMPORTANCE OF THE GOAL, WITH A BOX AT THE FOOT OF THE CHART TORECORD THE VISUAL ESTIMATES OF THE RELATIVE ACCEPTABILITY OF EACH ALTERNATIVE.GIVES AN EXAMPLE OF ITS USE.
5142|A COST DATABASE FOR BRANCH LIBRARY RESOURCE ALLOCATION AND PERFORMANCEEVALUATION.SHOWS HOW THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION LIBRARIES (USA) HAVE IMPROVED THEIRKNOWLEDGE OF RESOURCE ALLOCATION BY TAGGING EACH EXPENDITURE ACCORDING TOFISCAL YEAR, LIBRARY GOAL, OBJECT CLASS, FUND TYPE, FUND SOURCE, COST CENTRE,AND BENEFIT CENTRE. DESCRIBES HOW THE DATA IS GATHERED AND MANIPULATED.MEASURING LIBRARY EFFECTIVENESS IS ULTIMATELY DESIRED, THEN COMPARISONSBETWEEN BRANCHES CAN BE MEANINGFUL.
5143|COPING WITH LIMITED BUDGETS BY SHARING RESOURCES.TO COPE WITH LIMITED BUDGETS, US HIGHER EDUCATION LIBRARIES ARE RESTRICTINGTHEIR PURCHASES AND RELYING ON RESOURCE SHARING. DISCUSSES SOME SPECIFICS ONHOW THIS IS DONE AND THE DANGERS IT ENTAILS.
5144|PENNYWISE' A SUMMARY OF BUDGET PROCEDURES.CONSIDERS 7| BUDGETARY APPROACHES FOR LIBRARIANS' LUMP-SUM; LINE-ITEM; FORMULA;PROGRAMME; PERFORMANCE; PLANNING PROGRAMMING BUDGETING SYSTEMS AND ZERO-BASEDBUDGETING. NOT ALL ARE USED WITH EQUAL FREQUENCY IN SCHOOLS AND PUBLICLIBRARIES, BUT KNOWLEDGE OF THE STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES OF EACH IS A STEPTOWARD THE FISCAL SELF-EDUCATION THAT WILL HELP LIBRARIES HOLD THEIR OWN WITHBUDGETARY DECISION-MAKERS.
5145|CHINESE CHARACTER COMPUTER ENCODING METHODS AND LIBRARY AUTOMATION' ABIBLIOGRAPHICAL SURVEY.DESCRIBES DEVELOPMENTS IN CHINESE CHARACTER COMPUTER ENCODING METHODS ANDLIBRARY AUTOMATION. MUCH EFFORT IS EXPENDED IN INDIVIDUAL AND EXPANDEDPROJECTS WHILE INCREASED INTERCOMMUNICATION AND CONCERTED ENDEAVOURS MIGHTHELP TO SOLVE COMMON PROBLEMS.
5146|EVALUATING WORD PROCESSING SYSTEMS' ABILITY TO STORE DATA.DESCRIBES THE EVALUATION OF STORAGE OF DATA IN WORD PROCESSORS FOR LIBRARYPURPOSES IN TERMS OF' DIFFERENT KINDS OF MEDIUM AND THEIR STORAGECAPABILITIES; TOTAL ON-LINE STORAGE; THE NUMBER AND VARIETY OF STORAGE DEVICESUSABLE AT 1| TIME; THE NUMBER OF FILES AVAILABLE ON-LINE; FILE LENGTH; HOW TOARCHIVE; COPYING FILES AND DISCS; SAFETY AND SECURITY; AND SPECIAL FEATURES OFSYSTEMS.
5147|COMPUTER SOFTWARE AND EQUIPMENT CONSIDERATIONS.AIMS TO PROVIDE A STARTING POINT FOR UNDERSTANDING WHAT A SMALL COMPUTERSYSTEM FOR LIBRARY APPLICATIONS INCLUDES AND HOW TO GET FURTHER INFORMATION ONCOSTS OF COMPUTER SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE. CONSIDERS' TERMINOLOGY; ADDINGTERMINALS; PRINTING CAPABILITIES; DIFFERENT TYPES OF DISC STORAGE;COMMUNICATION CAPABILITIES; AND SERVICE AND MAINTENANCE.

5202|THE RESULTS OF THE ACTIVITIES OF THE CZECHOSLOVAK STI SYSTEM IN THE PERIOD OFTHE 6|TH 5|-YEAR PLAN.THE MAIN DIRECTIONS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE CZECHOSLOVAK STI SYSTEM IN THEYEARS 1976|-80| WERE DETERMINED BY THE OBJECTIVES OF THE STATE INFORMATIONPROGRAMME. NEW BRANCH INFORMATION CENTRES WERE ESTABLISHED IN SEVERAL BRANCHESOF SCIENCE AND INDUSTRY, THUS BRINGING THE TOTAL NUMBER OF BRANCH CENTRES TO2|,081| AND THE TOTAL NUMBER OF THEIR STAFF TO 9|,271| IN 1980|. THE DEVELOPMENT OFAUTOMATED PROCESSING OF BIBLIOGRAPHIC AND NON-BIBLIOGRAPHIC INFORMATION WASINFLUENCED BY THE ACTIVITIES OF THE CENTRAL TECHNOLOGICAL BASE (CTB) OF COSTEIIN PRAGUE. 11| BIBLIOGRAPHICAL DATA BASES FROM ABROAD AND 9| DOMESTIC ONES AREUSED IN VARIOUS BRANCHES AND SUBJECT. CTB OPERATES 2| DATA BASES OF CENTRALINVENTORIES (RESEARCH REPORTS AND DISSERTATIONS, AND, REPORTS OF BUSINESSJOURNEYS), A UNION CATALOGUE OF FOREIGN PERIODICALS AND THE SLOVAK NATIONALBIBLIOGRAPHY. SOME SELECTED PROCESSES OF SEVERAL MAJOR LIBRARIE S WERE ALSOCOMPUTERISED IN THE GIVEN PERIOD.
5203|THE INFORMATION NEEDS OF THE DEVELOPING COUNTRIES' ANALYTICAL CASE-STUDIES.UNESCO AND THE UNITED NATIONS INTERIM FUND FOR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY FORDEVELOPMENT (IFSTD) HAVE UNDERTAKEN A STUDY TO DETERMINE THE REAL NEEDS ANDOPTIONS FOR ACCESS TO INFORMATION IN 8| DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. THE CONCLUSIONSOF THE ANALYTICAL CASE-STUDIES ON THESE COUNTRIES ARE GIVEN.
5204|CENTRES FOR ACQUISITION AND DISSEMINATION OF SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICALINFORMATION' THE FRENCH MINISTRY OF UNIVERSITIES INFORMATION POLICY.AS PART OF THE PROJECTED FRENCH NATIONAL INFORMATION SYSTEM, THE 1|ST STAGE OFTHE CADIST PLAN WAS IMPLEMENTED IN JAN 81|, WHEN 10| UNIVERSITIES TOOKRESPONSIBILITY FOR THE COLLECTION AND DISSEMINATION OF INFORMATION IN 11|DESIGNATED FIELDS. EVENTUALLY 20| UNIVERSITIES WILL COVER A TOTAL OF 30| SUBJECTAREAS, OBTAINING THE MOST COMPLETE INFORMATION AND SIMPLIFYING ACCESS TOPRIMARY SOURCES. THE REASONS FOR CHOOSING THIS KIND OF SYSTEM AS OPPOSED TOTHE UK OR GERMAN MODELS, THE SELECTION OF CENTRES AND THEIR MANDATE, AND THEIRRIGHTS AND DUTIES AS OFFICIALLY PRESCRIBED, ARE DISCUSSED.
5205|PROPOSAL FOR ESTABLISHING A BELGIAN COUNCIL FOR SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION.IN ORDER TO COORDINATE AND DEVELOP THE ACTIVITIES OF PRODUCERS OF SCIENTIFICINFORMATION, SUCH AS UNIVERSITIES AND RESEARCH CENTRES, AND LIBRARIES ANDDOCUMENTATION CENTRES, IN PROMOTING ACCESS TO SUCH INFORMATION, WITHIN THEBELGIAN FRENCH COMMUNITY, AN OFFICIAL REPRESENTATIVE AND CONSULTATIVE BODYSHOULD BE ESTABLISHED UNDER GOVERNMENT AUSPICES. 7| ARTICLES ARE ADVANCED TOCOVER THE INSTITUTION OF SUCH A COUNCIL, COVERING REPRESENTATION, ELECTION,POWERS AND DUTIES, RELATIONS WITH GOVERNMENT, FINANCE, AND OFFICIAL AUDIT.
5206|DOCUMENTATION SPECIALISTS AND QUEBEC GOVERNMENT POLICY ON SCIENTIFIC ANDTECHNICAL INFORMATION.DISCUSSES RECENT QUEBEC GOVERNMENT PROPOSALS FOR ESTABLISHING A NATIONALINFORMATION NETWORK, AND THE REACTIONS OF THE 2| CHIEF QUEBEC LIBRARIANSASSOCIATIONS, ASTED AND CBPQ. GOVERNMENT POLICY AS SET FORTH IN A RECENT WHITEPAPER IS OUTLINED, AND THE RESPONSES FROM ASTED AND CBPQ SUMMARISED. THEGOVERNMENT INTENTION TO DEMOCRATISE SCIENCE BY EDUCATION AND POPULARISATION ISGENERALLY APPROVED, BUT CRITICISM IS MADE OF THE PROPOSED IMPLEMENTATIONPROCEDURES. IN EMPHASISING THE NECESSITY OF LOCAL DECISION-MAKING IN THECREATION OF INFORMATION NETWORKS, THE IMPORTANCE OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND AGLOBAL ORIENTATION IS BEING IGNORED.
5207|INFORMATION SCIENCE AND ITS SIGNIFICANCE FOR SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH ACTIVITIES.ONE OF THE WAYS OF INCREASING THE CONTRIBUTION OF SCIENTIFIC INFORMATIONSERVICES TO SCIENTIFIC CREATIVE WORK IS THROUGH THEIR IDENTIFICATION WITH THELOGICAL, PSYCHOLOGICAL, SOCIAL AND ORGANISATIONAL NEEDS OF THE RESEARCHPROCESS. COOPERATION ITSELF BETWEEN RESEARCH AND INFORMATION WORKERS CAN BEGINEVEN BEFORE THERE IS A SPECIFIC RESEARCH TASK; SOME INSTITUTIONS HAVEEXPERIMENTED WITH THE POLICY THAT EACH NEW RESEARCHER HAS TO SPEND A MONTH OR2| IN THE INFORMATION DEPARTMENT. THE COOPERATION GOES THROUGH SEVERAL STAGES,FROM THE PRELIMINARY SEARCH TO AVOID DUPLICATION IN RESEARCH TO THE CLOSERCOLLABORATION OF BOTH PARTNERS' TEAMS. SOMETIMES THE COLLABORATION IS SO CLOSETHAT AN INFORMATION SCIENTIST BECOMES A CO-AUTHOR.
5208|DISSEMINATION OF THE PUBLISHED RESULTS OF AN IMPORTANT CLINICAL TRIAL' ANANALYSIS OF THE CITING LITERATURE.PRESENTS THE RESULTS OF A CITATION ANALYSIS STUDY OF AN IMPORTANT CLINICALTRIAL WHICH DEMONSTRATED THE BENEFICIAL EFFECTS OF A TECHNIQUE FOR TREATINGDIABETICS. THE STUDY WAS CARRIED OUT TO DETERMINE WHY THIS TECHNIQUE WAS STILLNOT WELL KNOWN 18| MONTHS AFTER ITS PUBLICATION. CONCLUDES THAT A LARGE NUMBEROF CITATIONS IN THE LITERATURE TO A CLINICALLY SIGNIFICANT PAPER DO NOT OFITSELF ENSURE THAT THE INFORMATION REPORTED WILL READILY REACH THE APPROPRIATEPRACTICING PHYSICIAN. STRESSES THE NEED FOR MORE EFFECTIVE METHODS FOR THERAPID DISSEMINATION OF IMPORTANT NEW FINDINGS TO THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY.
5209|BIBLIOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SUPPORT FOR THE COMPLEX PROGRAMME 'SIBERIA'.IN 1977| THE SIBIRSKOE OTDELENIE AKADEMII NAUK (SIBERIAN DEPARTMENT OF THEACADEMY OF SCIENCES) LAUNCHED A MAJOR LONG TERM RESEARCH PROGRAMME ENTITLED'COMPLEX OF NATURAL RESOURCES IN SIBERIA'.

INFORMATION STORAGE AND RETRIEVAL AREPARTLY MECHANISED AND PARTLY MANUAL. EMPHASIS IS LAID ON THE PROVISION OFINFORMATION FOR MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING BACKGROUND INFORMATION AND SPECIFICPROCESSES; STUDIES OF INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS ARE PRODUCED AND A MONTHLYBULLETIN INCLUDES RELEVANT NEW ARTICLES FROM PERIODICALS AND OTHER SOURCES ONNEW PROCESSES. INFORMATION STOCKS COMPRISE MAINLY MONOGRAPHS AND PERIODICALS.FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS WILL IN CLUDE THE EXTENSION OF THE RANGE OF MICROFILMEQUIPMENT AND SERVICES.
5211|ON THE PROVISION OF INFORMATION FOR THE USE OF MICROELECTRONICS IN A FACTORYCOMBINE.MICROELECTRONICS HAVE A STRONG INFLUENCE OVER MOST CONTEMPORARY INDUSTRIALWORKING PROCESSES, INCLUDING NOT ONLY THE FLOW OF MATERIAL, ENERGY ANDINFORMATION BUT ALSO GENERAL ORGANISATION AND MANAGEMENT. THUS IT IS CLEARTHAT THE STAFF OF SPECIALIST RESEARCH ORGANISATIONS HAVE A GREATER NEED THANEVER BEFORE OF A COMPREHENSIVE RANGE OF INFORMATION. EXAMPLES OF THIS NEED ANDSUGGESTIONS FOR ITS RATIONAL SATISFACTION ARE PRESENTED WITH REFERENCE TOEXPERIENCES IN A STRIP STEEL FACTORY CONCERNING THE USE OF MICROELECTRONICS ININDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION, SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH, FINANCIAL CALCULATIONS, STATISTICSAND MANAGEMENT. THE USE OF MICROELECTRONICS IS STILL IN ITS INFANCY; ITSPOTENTIAL IN LARGE SCALE INFORMATION STORAGE AND DISSEMINATION IS NOT YETFULLY EXPLOITED.
5212|A MORE EFFECTIVE SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL INFORMATION SERVICE FOR THE TYREINDUSTRY IN THE GERMAN DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC.THE INFORMATION CENTRE AT FURSTENWALDE, EAST GERMANY COORDINATES WORK WITHSUBJECT EXPERTS IN DIFFERENT BRANCHES OF THE TYRE INDUSTRY. INFORMATIONSERVICES HERE ARE A PART OF THE NATIONAL CHEMICAL INFORMATION SYSTEM WHICH ISLINKED IN TURN WITH SERVICES IN OTHER COMMUNIST COUNTRIES. THE CENTREPUBLISHES A MONTHLY JOURNAL CONTAINING ABSTRACTS AND PATENT INFORMATION; OTHERSERVICES INCLUDE SELECTIVE INFORMATION DISSEMINATION, RETROSPECTIVE SEARCHING,LITERATURE SURVEYS AND THE PUBLICATION OF REPORTS. DEVELOPMENT PLANS FOR1981|-85| PROPOSE' CLOSER COOPERATION WITH TECHNOLOGICAL POLICY; A WIDER RANGEOF SOURCE MATERIAL, ESPECIALLY FROM THE USSR; INCREASED COOPERATION WITHNATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS; BETTER MANAGEMENT; THE USE OFAUTOMATED DATA PROCESSING; AND HIGHER QUALIFICATIONS FOR STAFF.

5214|EXPERIENCES AT THE CONTROL CENTRE OF THE INFORMATION SYSTEM ON AGRICULTURE ANDFOOD IN THE GERMAN DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC.2| TYPES OF STRUCTURAL ORGANISATION AND THE OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES INVOLVED ININFORMATION WORK ARE DESCRIBED WHICH HAVE PROVED THEMSELVES HELPFUL IN THECREATION OF AN EFFECTIVE INFORMATION SERVICE FOR THE SUBJECT AREAS OFAGRICULTURE, FORESTRY AND FOOD ECONOMICS AND THEIR USE IS ILLUSTRATED WITHREFERENCE TO INFORMATION ON MILK MARKETING AND GENERAL COOPERATION WITHIN THESYSTEM ON THE ECONOMICS OF AGRICULTURE AND FOOD. IT IS CLEAR THAT, THROUGHUNIFIED AS WELL AS DIFFERENTIAL COMPETENCE RELATIONSHIPS OF THE INFORMATIONSERVICES INVOLVED, THROUGH WORK SHARING, SPECIALISATION AND COOPERATION, ANIMPROVEMENT IN PERFORMANCE, QUALITY AND RELATED EFFECTIVITY CAN BE ACHIEVED INTHE PRESENTATION AND PROCESSING OF INFORMATION.
5215|INFORMATION AND MANAGEMENT.DEMONSTRATES HOW RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN INFORMATION MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUES CANBE USED IN ADMINISTRATION. THE IMPORTANCE OF INFORMATION IN DECISION MAKING ISDISCUSSED WITH REFERENCE TO THE MANAGER'S RESPONSIBILITY FOR COORDINATINGACCESS TO INFORMATION RESOURCES AND ENSURING THAT EXPLOITATION IS COSTEFFECTIVE. PROPOSES A PRACTICAL MODEL FOR ORGANISING AN INTEGRATED INFORMATIONSERVICE, SUFFICIENTLY FLEXIBLE TO DRAW ON ALL AVAILABLE EXISTING INFORMATIONNETWORKS IN AN ORGANISATION, THROUGH A COMMON CODIFICATION. THEN DISCUSSESCODIFICATION OPERATIONS, EMPHASISING THE IMPORTANCE OF STANDARDISATION HERE IFTHE INFORMATION SYSTEM IS TO FUNCTION SUCCESSFULLY.
5216|LIBRARIANS AND INFORMATION MANAGEMENT IN PRIVATE ENTERPRISE AND GOVERNMENTAGENCIES.DISCUSSES HOW THE LIBRARIAN CAN SERVE THE INFORMATION NEEDS OF A SPECIALISEDTYPE OF ORGANISATION AND CONSIDERS HOW INFORMATION IS USED IN GOVERNMENT ANDPRIVATE ENTERPRISE, ITS IMPORTANCE AS A RESOURCE, AND WHAT INFORMATIONMANAGEMENT INVOLVES. THE LIBRARIAN ACCORDINGLY MUST ADAPT HIS SKILLS TO THEDEMANDS OF THE PARTICULAR ENVIRONMENT, WHERE INVOLVEMENT IN INFORMATIONMANAGEMENT AND THE ORGANISATION'S OPERATIONS REQUIRES ACTIVE PARTICIPATION INPLANNING ACTIVITIES AND OPERATIONS SUPPORT. SUGGESTS HOW SIMILAR ORGANISATIONSCOULD SHARE INFORMATION RESOURCES THROUGH NETWORK COOPERATION, AND ILLUSTRATESTHE LIBRARIAN'S ROLE IN SUPPORTING ORGANISATION OPERATIONS. FINALLY EMPHASISESTHE IMPORTANCE OF ADAPTING TRAINING PROGRAMMES TO RECOGNISE THE KIND OFDEMANDS THE LIBRARIAN WILL MEET IN THIS CONTEXT.

EVENGREATER BARRIERS ARE PREDICTED. THE SUBCOMMITTEE'S RECOMMENDATIONS FOCUS ONTHE NEED FOR BETTER ORGANISATION AND REPRESENTATION OF US INTERESTS WORLDWIDEAND A COHERENT US POLICY.
5228|ADMINISTRATIVE CONSTRAINTS AS A HINDRANCE TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF DOCUMENTATIONSERVICES.DISCUSSES WHY DOCUMENTATION SERVICES AT PRESENT ARE MEETING ADMINISTRATIVEOPPOSITION TO EXPANSION AND DEVELOPMENT, AND SOME POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS, WITHREFERENCE TO CLASSICAL ORGANISATION THEORY. EXAMINES THE ENVIRONMENTAL ANDECONOMIC OBSTACLES TO ACCESSIBILITY OF INFORMATION AND DEVELOPMENT OFSERVICES, AND PROPOSES THAT ORGANISATION PERFORMANCE BE RATED ACCORDING TO ITSUSE, NOT ITS OBJECTIVES. IF THIS IS ACCEPTED, THE INCREASED USE OF INFORMATIONNETWORKS WOULD PROVIDE A POSSIBLE SOLUTION TO CURRENT PROBLEMS, BUT CERTAINLYGREATER EMPHASIS ON MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUES IS ESSENTIAL IN TRAINING INFORMATIONPROFESSIONALS.
5229|BAKER'S STRATEGY FLOUNDERS.A CRITICAL ANALYSIS OF THE PROGRESS MADE BY THE UK'S MINISTER FOR INFORMATIONTECHNOLOGY KENNETH BAKER DURING HIS 1|ST YEAR OF OFFICE, INCLUDING INFORMATIONTECHNOLOGY YEAR. LOOKS PARTICULARLY AT PLANS FOR EDUCATION AND TRAINING ANDLIST PROJECTS OF 1981|. WITHOUT THE POLITICAL MUSCLE OF A FULL MINISTRY WITHITS OWN BUDGET AND INFLUENCE IN THE CABINET, EVERYTHING BAKER TRIES TO DO WILLINEVITABLY BE TACTICAL RATHER THAN STRATEGIC, AND RESPONSIVE RATHER THAN TRULYINITIATING.
5230|USER EDUCATION-FOR LIFE?.USER EDUCATION PROGRAMMES FALL INTO 2| CATEGORIES. THEY MAY AIM SIMPLY TO HELPTHE STUDENT THROUGH HIS COURSE AND FAMILIARISE HIM WITH A SINGLE LIBRARY(SHORT-TERM OBJECTIVES), OR TO PROVIDE A FULLER AWARENESS OF THE GENERATION,ROLE, AND USE OF INFORMATION WHICH MAY ALLOW HIM TO RESEARCH PROBLEMS IN ANYSUBSEQUENT PROFESSIONAL SITUATION (LONG-TERM OBJECTIVES). ARGUES THAT THELATTER ARE MORE VALUABLE; THE OBJECTIVES OF LIBRARIAN AND STUDENT ON SUCHCOURSES ARE DISCUSSED IN DETAIL. A USER EDUCATION COURSE BASED ON LONG-TERMOBJECTIVES IS DESCRIBED, AND ITS EFFECTS ON STUDENT AND LIBRARY DISCUSSED.FINALLY, THE CONTRIBUTION OF USER EDUCATION TO THE 'INFORMATION SOCIETY' ISCONSIDERED, AND USER EDUCATION PROGRAMMES WITH LONG-TERM OBJECTIVES PREFERRED.

AN APPENDIX PROVIDESA SELECTED LIST OF SUBJECT AREA REFERENCE SOURCES BY CALL NUMBER OR LOCATION.REPORT NOT AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
5234|INFORMATION AND DOCUMENTATION' AN UNDERDEVELOPED AREA IN THE WORLD OFEDUCATION.CREATIVE ACTIVITIES ARE CURRENTLY FASHIONABLE; IN INFORMATION ANDDOCUMENTATION THEY HAVE PRODUCED A VAST QUANTITY OF LITERATURE, MOST OF WHICHMUST ULTIMATELY BE DISCARDED FOR FINANCIAL REASONS. NEVERTHELESS THESEACTIVITIES ARE NECESSARY BECAUSE EACH STUDENT AND RESEARCHER SHOULD OFFER HISIDEAS TO HIS COLLEAGUES FOR EXAMINATION; SCIENTIFIC PROBLEMS TOUCH ON SEVERALDISCIPLINES AND SO REQUIRE MULTILATERAL PLANNING; AND NEGLECTING TO STUDYCURRENT INTERNATIONAL LITERATURE CAN PROVE COSTLY OR CAN RESULT IN VAGUE,UTOPIAN PROJECTS. YOUNG SCIENTISTS AND ENGINEERS MUST DEVOTE TIME TOLITERATURE STUDY; TRAINING AT UNIVERSITY LEVEL AND IN THE FACTORY OR RESEARCHCENTRE IS NEEDED. OFFICIAL DOCUMENTATION CENTRES MUST BE USER-ORIENTED.
5235|INTRODUCTION OF STANDARDS TO BIBLIOGRAPHICAL PRACTICE.REVIEWS THE WORK OF THE KNIZHNAYA PALATA USSR (THE UKRAINIAN BOOK CHAMBER) INTHE FIELD OF STANDARDISATION. THE APPLICATION OF STANDARDS TO BIBLIOGRAPHICALWORK AND PUBLISHING WAS 1| OF THE MAIN TOPICS OF THE CHAMBER'S RESEARCHPROGRAMME IN THE PERIOD 1976|-80|. ON THE NATIONAL LEVEL THE CHAMBER COOPERATEDWITH THE VSESOYUZNAYA KNIZHNAYA PALATA (ALL-UNION BOOK CHAMBER) AND THEGOSUDARSTVENNAYA BIBLIOTEKA SSSR IM. V.I. LENINA (LENIN STATE LIBRARY) IN THEPREPARATION OF STANDARDS FOR DOCUMENTATION, BIBLIOGRAPHIC INFORMATION,CATALOGUING DESCRIPTION, PUBLICATION TERMINOLOGY AND ABBREVIATIONS. ON THEREPUBLICAN LEVEL THE CHAMBER IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE APPLICATION OF STANDARDSIN UKRAINIAN PUBLISHING.
5236|THE ACQUISITION OF AND BIBLIOGRAPHIC ACCESS TO INFORMATION-A TASK FORLIBRARIES?.LIBRARIES SHOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ACQUIRING 2|INFORMATIONSMITTEL1| AS DEFINEDBY GEORG SCHMOLL SUPPLYING A SUMMARISED FORM OF INFORMATION SOURCES ANDPRESENTING IT TO THE USER IN A PRACTICAL FORM. AT PRESENT THIS TYPE OFMATERIAL (BIBLIOGRAPHICAL MATERIAL, INCLUDING LIBRARY CATALOGUES) IS NOTCOLLECTED BY LIBRARIES IN SUFFICIENT QUANTITIES AS IT IS OFTEN NOT AVAILABLETHROUGH NORMAL MARKET SOURCES VIA PUBLISHERS. AS INFORMATION MATERIAL ISGENERALLY IN A PROCESSED FORM, LIBRARIES DO NOT ALWAYS CLASSIFY THE CONTENTSFURTHER. HOWEVER, THE FORM IN WHICH THE MATERIAL IS MADE AVAILABLE TO THE USERIS VERY IMPORTANT AS IT SHOULD BE POSSIBLE TO MAKE INDEPENDENT USE OF THEINFORMATION. OFTEN THE MATERIAL IS CLASSIFIED TO BE USED BY PARTICULAR USERGROUPS, FIRMS, LIBRARY COLLECTIVES OR SECTORS OF THE INFORMATION ANDDOCUMENTATION SYSTEM. LIBRARIES MUST TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION WHICH USER GROUPSNEED WHICH INFORMATION MATERIAL IN THEIR AREA AND ALSO WORK WITH OTHERLIBRARIES TO PROVIDE A LARGER SELECTION OF NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONALINFORMATION MATERIAL.
5237|PROBLEMS OF IMPROVING BIBLIOGRAPHICAL WORK IN THE USSR.BIBLIOGRAPHICAL WORK IN THE USSR IS REVIEWED IN THE LIGHT OF THE DECISIONS OFTHE CENTRAL COMMITTEE OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY IN 2|ON FURTHER IMPROVEMENT OFIDEOLOGICAL AND POLITICAL EDUCATION1|. MAIN ACHIEVEMENTS OF SEVERAL LIBRARIESAND INFORMATION CENTRES IN THE ADVANCEMENT OF BIBLIOGRAPHICAL WORK INCLUDETHOSE IN THE NATIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHY, CENTRALISED CATALOGUING AND BIBLIOGRAPHICSERVICES TO SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY. THOSE ASPECTS OF BIBLIOGRAPHICAL WORK NOTDEVELOPED TO A SATISFACTORY LEVEL ARE' CHILDREN'S BIBLIOGRAPHY, PLANNING ANDCOORDINATION OF BIBLIOGRAPHICAL WORK AND THE USE OF RESOURCES. AN IMPORTANTROLE WILL BE PLAYED BY AUTOMATION IN THE IMPROVEMENT OF BIBLIOGRAPHICALPROCESSES.
5238|BIBLIOGRAPHY IN THE SERVICE OF SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL PROGRESS.REPORTS ON THE CONFERENCE 'ON THE IMPROVEMENT OF BIBLIOGRAPHICAL WORK IN THEUSSR' HELD IN OCT 80|.

5240|PROBLEMS WITH SOURCES OF INFORMATION IN INTERNATIONAL LAW AND RELATIONS' THECASE OF THE WORLD-WIDE TREATY JUNGLE.LIBRARIES ARE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE BIBLIOGRAPHICAL GUIDANCE TO AND THROUGH THE'TREATY JUNGLE' ENGENDERED BY THE DIVERSITY OF NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONALINTERESTS CAUSED BY THE RECENT DRAMATIC INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF INDEPENDENTNATION STATES. THE DEGREE OF ACCESSIBILITY TO TREATY INFORMATION IS MUCHGREATER THAN BEFORE' TREATY INFORMATION IS NO LONGER THE PRESERVE OFGOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, THANKS TO PUBLICATIONS LIKE THE UNITED NATIONS TREATYSERIES. THERE IS STILL A NEED, HOWEVER, FOR A BIBLIOGRAPHY OF CURRENTLYPUBLISHED TREATY COLLECTIONS AND TREATIES IN FORCE. THE MANY PROBLEMS STILLFACED IN GAINING ACCESS TO TREATY INFORMATION CAN ONLY BE SOLVED BYINTERNATIONAL COOPERATION AND BETTER SUPPORT FOR THE UNITED NATIONS TREATYSECTION.
5241|RECOMMENDED BIBLIOGRAPHY' AN IMPORTANT AID TO COMMUNIST EDUCATION.MAJOR FUNCTIONS OF RECOMMENDED BIBLIOGRAPHY ARE' TO ASSIST IN THE ORGANISATIONOF READING WITH REGARD TO EDUCATION AND DEVELOPMENT OF PERSONALITY; AND TOASSIST IN THE PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT OF PERSONNEL AND SPECIALISTS. A WELLDEVELOPED THEORY OF RECOMMENDED BIBLIOGRAPHY IS BROUGHT INTO PRACTICE THROUGHTHE UNIFIED SYSTEM OF RECOMMENDED BIBLIOGRAPHIES. THE LEADING ROLE IS HELD, INTHE SYSTEM, BY THE GOSUDARSTVENNAYA BIBLIOTEKA IM. V.I. LENINA (LENIN STATELIBRARY) WHOSE WORK REPRESENTS THE CURRENT STANDARD OF RECOMMENDEDBIBLIOGRAPHY IN THE COUNTRY. AS THE CENTRE OF BIBLIOGRAPHICAL WORK AT THENATIONAL LEVEL, THE LIBRARY IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE FORECASTING, PLANNING ANDDESIGN OF BIBLIOGRAPHICAL WORK IN LIBRARIES AND FOR THE PROVISION OFMETHODOLOGICAL GUIDANCE IN THIS FIELD.
5242|WHY ENGINEERS DON'T USE DATABASES.SHORTENED VERSION OF AN ARTICLE IN 2|MECHANICAL ENGINEERING1| MAR 81|. CLAIMSTHAT US ENGINEERS LARGELY IGNORE COMPUTERISED DATA BANKS AND USE DATED ANDLIMITED INFORMATION SOURCES. THEY COLLECT MOST OF THEIR ADVANCED TECHNICALINFORMATION THROUGH DISCUSSIONS WITH VENDORS, SALESMEN, CONSULTANTS, AND THEIRPEERS AND RESTRICT THEIR FORMAL READING TO THE MATERIAL IN THE VICINITY OFTHEIR DESKS. THE CULPRIT IS THE INDEXING' THE MAJOR INDEXING SYSTEMS INDEX BYSUBJECT OR THE NAME OF AN OBJECT, BUT AN ENGINEER WISHES TO RETRIEVEINFORMATION INDEXED BY FUNCTION. ALSO, VITAL PRODUCT INFORMATION IS NOTAVAILABLE ON A CREDITABLE DATA BASE.
5243|THE USE OF SECONDARY INFORMATION SOURCES FOR PATENT INFORMATION.THE EXPANSION OF INDUSTRIALLY ORIENTED PATENT INFORMATION SERVICES MEANS THATINFORMATION ON PATENTS MUST BE QUALITATIVELY AND QUANTITATIVELY IMPROVED,WHICH PRESUPPOSES THE USE OF RATIONAL PROCEDURES FOR OBTAINING PATENTDESCRIPTIONS. WITH EXAMPLES TAKEN FROM PATENT DESCRIPTIONS FROM EAST AND WESTGERMANY, THE ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF SUBJECT DOCUMENTATION THROUGH THEUSE OF PRIMARY SOURCES OR ABSTRACTS ARE PRESENTED. GENERALLY THE BEST RESULTSARE ACHIEVED WHEN CONTENT ANALYSIS IS BASED ON AN ABSTRACT OR SUMMARY; PRIMARYSOURCES ARE OFTEN OF EXCELLENT QUALITY, ESPECIALLY THOSE FROM EAST GERMANY,BUT THEIR USE CAN BE EXPENSIVE AND TIME-CONSUMING.
5244|DESIGNING SECONDARY SERVICES IN THE SOCIAL SCIENCES' REFLECTIONS ON A RESEARCHPROJECT.THE RESEARCH PROGRAMME 'DESIGN OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS IN THE SOCIAL SCIENCES'(DISISS) CONDUCTED A LARGE-SCALE STUDY OF SECONDARY SERIALS AND THEIREFFECTIVENESS AS INFORMATION SOURCES IN THE SOCIAL SCIENCES.

A CHRONOLOGICAL REVIEWOF THE INSTITUTE'S PUBLICATIONS IS FOLLOWED BY AN ANALYSIS OF THEIR COVERAGEOF PRIMARY MATERIALS. THE WORK OF THE INSTITUTE HAS BEEN MADE KNOWN IN THEUSSR THROUGH PRESENTATIONS AT VARIOUS BOOK FAIRS AND SEVERAL LARGE INFORMATIONCENTRES AND AROSE A GREAT DEAL OF INTEREST AMONG SOVIET SPECIALISTS.
5246|LINGUISTIC SUPPORT IN AUTOMATED LIBRARY SYSTEMS.AIMS TO SHOW THE CURRENT POSITION AND FUTURE DEVELOPMENT OF LINGUISTICSUPPORT, WITH PARTICULAR REFERENCE TO THE STATE AUTOMATED SYSTEM OF SCIENTIFICAND TECHNICAL INFORMATION (GASNTI). THE CONTENT AND STRUCTURE OF LINGUISTICSUPPORT IS DEFINED BY THE LEVEL OF DEVELOPMENT OF THE LIBRARY SERVICE AND THEINFORMATION INVOLVED. IN PRACTICE, LINGUISTIC SUPPORT HAS TO TAKE ACCOUNT OFNOT ONLY THE SUBJECT CONTENT BUT ALSO A RANGE OF EXTERNAL FEATURES INCLUDINGBIBLIOGRAPHICAL DESCRIPTION. ITS APPLICATION IN DIFFERENT SYSTEMS CAN BE SEENAT AN INTERNATIONAL LEVEL IN UNISIST, AS WELL AS AT NATIONAL AND LOCAL LEVEL.
5247|THE UZBEKISTAN BIBLIOGRAPHY OF NEWSPAPER ARTICLES AND REVIEWS.THE BIBLIOGRAPHY, PUBLISHED SINCE 1976| BY THE NATIONAL PUBLISHERS OF THEUZBEKISTAN SSR IN TASHKENT, LISTS ARTICLES FROM UZBEKISTAN NEWSPAPERSPUBLISHED IN UZBEKISH, RUSSIAN, TADZHIKISH AND KARAKALPAKISH.

EDUCATION SYSTEMS OF EASTERN EUROPE, THETEACHING OF CHILDREN FROM ETHNIC MINORITIES, THE EDUCATION OF MATURE STUDENTS,AND REMEDIAL EDUCATION. IN EACH CASE VERY LITTLE MATERIAL WAS TRACEABLE BYLOOKING UNDER THE MORE OBVIOUS HEADINGS AND IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO DECIDE WHENTHE SEARCH WAS COMPLETE. ONLY A COVER-TO-COVER READING OF BEI COULD RETRIEVEALL THE RELEVANT ARTICLES WITH ANY DEGREE OF CERTAINTY. ALTHOUGH MUCH MATERIALWAS IN BEI, THE USE OF PRECIS CONSTITUTED A BARRIER IN EVERY CASE AND MADERETRIEVAL DIFFICULT.

BELORUSSIA PROVIDES AN EXAMPLE OFTHIS AND ITS STATISTICS CAN BE FAVOURABLY COMPARED WITH THOSE OF THE USSR AS AWHOLE. THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW LIBRARIES INTO COOPERATIVE NETWORKS NECESSITATEDSPECIALISATION IN BOOK SELECTION, BUT THERE WAS FOUND TO BE LITTLE VALUE INSMALL LIBRARIES SPECIALISING WHILE ALL THE LARGER ONES MAINTAINED UNIVERSALSTOCKS. VARIOUS METHODS OF PROFILING WERE USED TO AVOID THIS.

LIBRARIANS SEEM, IN THEIR SELECTION, TO AVOIDCONTROVERSIAL TITLES; THE IDENTIFICATION OF THE ABSENCE OF CONTROVERSIALTITLES FROM THE LIBRARIANS' COLLECTIONS WAS NOT UNIFORMLY A SIGNAL FOR THEORDERING OF TITLES; AND THE PRESENCE OF LARGE NUMBERS OF RESTRICTED ACCESSMATERIALS AGAIN INDICATES LIBRARIANS' RELUCTANCE TO FACE CENSORSHIP BATTLES.
5287|SOUND CASSETTES IN THE LIBRARY (I).SINCE THE 1970|S THE PUBLIC HAVE MADE GREAT USE OF THE SOUND CASSETTES PROVIDEDIN LIBRARIES, WHICH HAS ENCOURAGED LIBRARIANS TO INCREASE STOCKS. LIBRARIANSARE USED TO COPING WITH THE RELATIVELY WELL ORGANISED BOOK MARKET, WHERE LISTSAND REVIEWS OF NEW PUBLICATIONS ARE EASILY OBTAINED AND CRITERIA FOREVALUATING THEM WELL ESTABLISHED. THE STRUCTURE OF THE SOUND CASSETTE MARKETIS UNFAMILIAR TO LIBRARIANS. FEW LARGE FIRMS PRODUCE CASSETTES REGULARLY;SMALL NUMBERS OF INDIVIDUAL TAPES ARE OFTEN PRODUCED, WHICH DISAPPEAR BEFORETHEY CAN BE LISTED AND REVIEWED. THE BORROMEUS ASSOCIATION'S LIBRARY CENTREREVIEWS NEW TAPES TO HELP LIBRARIANS SELECT STOCKS. CRITERIA FOR EVALUATINGTAPES ARE NOT YET FIRMLY ESTABLISHED; ASSESSMENT SHOULD COVER THE TECHNICALQUALITY OF THE RECORDING AND THE STANDARD OF THE MATERIAL RECORDED.
5288|SOUND CASSETTES IN THE LIBRARY (III)' LANGUAGE COURSES AND CASSETTES.LIBRARIANS ARE OFTEN UNCERTAIN OF THE RIGHT CHOICES IN A LARGE MARKET. A BROADOUTLINE IS GIVEN OF CASSETTE MATERIAL AVAILABLE IN GERMANY FOR' SHORT COURSESFOR TOURISTS, WITH NOTES AND CASSETTES; COURSES OFFERING MORE DETAILEDTEXTBOOKS WITH COMPLEMENTARY CASSETTES; AND COMPLETE LANGUAGE COURSES WITHTEXTBOOKS, GRAMMAR, DICTIONARIES, EXERCISES, CASSETTES AND NOTES FOR TEACHERS.POSSIBLE CRITERIA FOR EVALUATION ARE' THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE COURSE CONTENTIS ADAPTED TO ADULT NEEDS; THE SUITABILITY OF THE COURSE'S DIDACTICCONSTRUCTION TO THOSE NEEDS, ESPECIALLY THE USE OF REALISTIC SITUATIONS ANDBACKGROUND INFORMATION; THE TOPICALITY OF VOCABULARY, IDIOM AND GRAMMAR; ANDTHE ACOUSTIC QUALITY, WHICH SHOULD USE DIFFERENT SPEAKERS AND NATURAL SPEECHRHYTHM AND MELODY, WITH PAUSES FOR STUDENTS TO REPEAT WORDS AND PHRASES.

A METHOD WAS DEVELOPED FROM THE CITATION FREQUENCYOF PERIODICALS FOR FINDING OUT THE BASIC IMPORTANT PERIODICALS. A COMPARISONWAS MADE BETWEEN REQUESTS FOR PERIODICALS FROM ULM AND COLOGNE AND A LIST OFAN INTERNATIONAL RANGE OF PUBLICATIONS MADE. THE NEW LIST IS CONSIDERED TO BEAS CLOSE AS POSSIBLE TO A MEDICAL LIBRARY'S BASIC NEEDS; ALL EXCEPT THESMALLEST HOSPITAL LIBRARIES WOULD REQUIRE LARGER STOCKS. THE NUMBER OF CURRENTPERIODICALS TAKEN BY A LIBRARY SHOULD DEPEND ON' THE NUMBER OF READERS ANDREQUESTS; AND THE AVAILABILITY OF THE PERIODICALS.
5293|BOOK SELECTION PRESSURE ON SCHOOL LIBRARY MEDIA SPECIALISTS AND TEACHERS.REPORT ON A STUDY CONDUCTED TO INVESTIGATE THE IMPACT OF WARNING SYMBOLS USEDIN CONNECTION WITH BOOK REVIEWS ON THE SELECTION PROCESS. ONE FINDINGINDICATES THAT A BOOK REVIEW WARNING SYMBOL SYSTEM EXERTS A NEGATIVECHOICE-AVOIDANCE INFLUENCE UPON ADULT BOOK SELECTORS WHEN CHOOSING CHILDREN'SBOOKS.

CRITICISES THE TRESS BRAUN INDEX SETUP BY THE UNIVERSITY GRANTS COMMISSION TO MONITOR PRICE INCREASES. SUGGESTSTHE FOLLOWING GUIDELINES FOR LIBRARIANS' NEVER SEPARATE PERIODICAL COMMITMENTFROM MONOGRAPH SPENDING; NEVER RUN A DEFICIT; AND ALWAYS KNOW WHAT NEXT YEAR'SBUDGET WILL BE; AND BE ABLE TO ALLOW FOR UNEXPECTED PRICE RISES. LOOKS AT THEGUIDELINES IN TERMS OF 2| MODEL CASE STUDIES. LIBRARIANS SHOULD COMPARE PRICESOF MATERIALS THROUGH DIFFERENT AGENTS AND SUPPLIERS TO GET THE BEST DEAL.
5296|THE FOUNDATION SECTION OF THE GERMAN RESEARCH ASSOCIATION.INFORMATION IS GIVEN FROM REPORTS PUBLISHED SINCE 1976| ON THE GERMAN RESEARCHASSOCIATION FOUNDATION SECTION'S ROLE AS PROVIDER OF MONEY FOR THE PURCHASE OFCOMPLETE SPECIAL LIBRARIES AND POSTHUMOUS WORKS. 46| SUCH COLLECTIONS HAVE BEENPURCHASED TO DATE AND DISTRIBUTED TO VARIOUS LIBRARIES THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY.IN 1980| PURCHASES INCLUDED SOME POSTHUMOUS PAPERS OF LUDWIG BINSWANGER FOR THEBAVARIAN STATE LIBRARY, THE LIBRARY OF THE MUSIC HISTORIAN FRIEDRICH GENNRICHFOR FRANKFURT MUNICIPAL LIBRARY AND A COLLECTION ON GERMAN POLITICAL HISTORYFOR THE KONRAD ADENAUER FOUNDATION.

THE RANGE ANDCRITERIA FOR THE RANDOM SAMPLE CORRESPONDS TO THE PURCHASING POLICY OF ALIBRARY AT THE 2|ND LEVEL ACCORDING TO 2|BIBLIOTHEKSPLAN '731|, (2|LIBRARY PLAN19731|). THE STATISTICS SHOW DEVELOPMENTS FROM 1975|-79| IN AMOUNTS SPENT ANDPROPORTIONS OF A TOTAL BUDGET.

CONSIDERATION IS GIVEN TOPOSSIBLE FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS.
5299|LAW OF LEGAL DEPOSIT RELATING TO 'LIBRARY MATERIALS' IN THE LIGHT OF THE NEWMEDIA ACT.THE AUSTRIAN LAW OF LEGAL DEPOSIT WAS DUE FOR REFORM, PARTLY TO BRING UP TODATE THE PRICE LIMITS FOR BOOKS DEPOSITED, AND PARTLY TO EXTEND THE SCOPE TOINCLUDE MULTI-MEDIA CATEGORIES. THE NEW ACT, WHICH CAME INTO FORCE IN JUNE 81|,IS CRITICISED FOR ITS EXCLUSION OF NON-BOOK MATERIALS (ESPECIALLY FILMS) INSPITE OF THE FACT THAT THE AUSTRIAN NATIONAL LIBRARY HAS A LEGAL OBLIGATION,SINCE JULY 81|, TO MAINTAIN MULTI-MEDIA ARCHIVES. THERE IS ALSO CRITICISM OFTHE INCLUSION OF PARLIAMENT AS A DEPOSIT LIBRARY, OF THE EXTENDED CATEGORIESOF EXEMPTION AND OF THE DECISION TO ALLOW PUBLISHERS 1| MONTH IN WHICH TODEPOSIT INSTEAD OF 8| DAYS AS PREVIOUSLY.
5300|DORMANT EXCHANGES SUPPORTED BY A SYSTEM OF TOKENS; A SUGGESTION.THE TERM 'DORMANT EXCHANGE' DESCRIBES AN EXCHANGE SYSTEM IN WHICH 1| LIBRARYNEEDS AND OBTAINS AN ITEM AT A GIVEN TIME FROM ANOTHER LIBRARY BUT NOT VICEVERSA. AN EXCHANGE IS STILL MADE, HOWEVER, BUT ON A CREDIT SYSTEM SO THAT THEOTHER LIBRARY CAN REQUEST DESIRED MATERIAL AT A LATER DATE WHEN THE NEEDARISES, THUS ELIMINATING WASTEFUL EXCHANGES. THE OPERATION COULD BE GREATLYSIMPLIFIED BY THE INTRODUCTION OF AN INTERNATIONALLY VALID EXCHANGE TOKENENABLING A RECIPIENT LIBRARY TO PAY FOR EXCHANGE MATERIAL AND A PROVIDINGLIBRARY TO RECEIVE CREDIT FOR WHAT IS SUPPLIED. IT IS CONCEDED THAT VALUATIONOF TOKENS COULD BE PROBLEMATIC.
5301|SOME ACQUISITION PROBLEMS IN BULGARIA.THE SPECIAL COMMISSION FOR ACQUISITION COORDINATION, PARTICULARLY WITH RESPECTTO FOREIGN PERIODICALS AND OTHER PUBLICATIONS, HAS BEEN IN OPERATION FOR MORETHAN 20| YEARS. DURING THAT TIME, SEVERAL NATIONAL VENUES HAVE TAKEN PLACEUNDER THE AUSPICES OF THE COMMISSION TO KEEP LIBRARIANS ABREAST OF THE LATESTDEVELOPMENTS, IN PARTICULAR IN THE FIELD OF INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGE OFPUBLICATIONS. 1| OF THE LATEST SEMINARS DEALT WITH COPYRIGHT PROBLEMS AFTER THEWIDE INTRODUCTION OF MODERN REPROGRAPHIC EQUIPMENT. INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGE HASBEEN FIRMLY ESTABLISHED IN MAJOR BULGARIAN LIBRARIES, INCLUDING THE CYRIL ANDMETHODIUS NATIONAL LIBRARY, THE BULGARIAN ACADEMY OF SCIENCES LIBRARY AND THEUNIVERSITY OF SOFIA LIBRARY.

SATISFACTION RATES AND SUPPLY TIMES BOTH NEED IMPROVEMENT.ABOUT 2|/3| OF DEMAND IS FOR JOURNALS, AND IS CONCENTRATED ON A SMALL NUMBER OFCENTRES, WHICH GIVE A MUCH BETTER THAN AVERAGE SERVICE. SPEED OF SUPPLYAPPEARS TO BE UNRELATED TO DISTANCE. POSSIBLE PATTERNS OF PROVISION FOR THEFUTURE INCLUDE ACCESS TO IMPROVED COLLECTIONS OF NATIONAL IMPRINTS, REGIONALSYSTEMS, AND LARGE NATIONAL DOCUMENT SUPPLY CENTRES IN COUNTRIES WITH HEAVYINTERLENDING DEMAND.

TOTAL ESTIMATES FOR DAMAGEDMATERIAL IN THE EARLY 1960|S WERE OVER 422|,000| DM, A SUM WHICH AT THAT TIMECOULD NOT BE MET. THE FLOODS OF 1962| IN HAMBURG CAUSED PARTICULAR PROBLEMS.SINCE 1978| EXTRA FINANCIAL HELP HAS COME FROM THE VOLKSWAGEN FOUNDATION. THEWORK IS NOT ONLY EXPENSIVE BUT ALSO EXCEPTIONALLY TIME-CONSUMING. THE WORKSHOPIS INVOLVED IN EXHIBITIONS, TRAINING COURSES FOR LIBRARY STUDENTS AND NATIONALAND INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCES; A COLLECTION OF SUBJECT LITERATURE HAS ALSOBEEN DEVELOPED.

THESE HAVE LED TO MANY WOULD-BE THEFTSBEING PREVENTED AND CHARGES BEING BROUGHT FOR THEFT. HOWEVER, THE MAJORITY OFTHESE CHARGES HAVE HAD TO BE DROPPED OWING TO LOOPHOLES IN LAWS APPLICABLE TOBOOK THEFTS. GERMAN CRIMINAL LAW STIPULATES THAT THE INTENTION OF KEEPING ANOBJECT MUST BE PRESENT TO CONSTITUTE A THEFT; THIS IS USUALLY IMPOSSIBLE TOPROVE IN THE CASE OF BOOK THEFTS. UNIVERSITY ADMINISTRATIVE LAW ALSO FAILS TOPROVIDE ADEQUATE PENALTIES AND VARIES FROM ONE STATE TO THE NEXT.

5362|BCUC AND SERIALS..PAPER PRESENTED AT THE CANADIAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION'S CANADIAN ASSOCIATION OFCOLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES TECHNICAL SERVICES COORDINATING GROUPWORKSHOP, VANCOUVER, B.C., 14| JUNE 80|. PRESENTS A SHORT HISTORY OF THEDEVELOPMENT OF THE BRITISH COLUMBIA UNION CATALOGUE PROJECT'S SERIALS TASKGROUP DEC 77|-JUNE 80|. OUTLINES OBSTACLES TO COOPERATION IN THE CREATION OF APROVINCIAL UNION CATALOGUE OF SERIALS AND PRESENTS SOME POSSIBLE METHODS OFOVERCOMING THESE OBSTACLES.
5363|ANSI Z39|.42| AND OCLC' OCLC'S IMPLEMENTATION OF THE AMERICAN NATIONAL STANDARDINSTITUTE'S SERIAL HOLDINGS STATEMENTS AT THE SUMMARY LEVEL.DESCRIBES THE ADOPTION OF THE AMERICAN NATIONAL STANDARD INSTITUTE'S STANDARD,FOR DESCRIBING SERIALS HOLDINGS AT THE SUMMARY LEVEL, BY ONLINE COMPUTERLIBRARY CENTER (OCLC). THIS FORMS PART OF OCLC'S POTENTIAL TO BECOME ANATIONWIDE UNION CATALOGUE OF PERIODICALS.
5364|THE ANSI STANDARD FOR SUMMARY HOLDINGS STATEMENTS FOR SERIALS' THE RLINIMPLEMENTATION.DESCRIBES THE APPLICATION OF THE AMERICAN NATIONAL STANDARD INSTITUTE'SSTANDARD FOR SERIAL HOLDINGS STATEMENTS (ANSI Z39|.42|) TO RLIN (RESEARCHLIBRARIES INFORMATION NETWORK).
5365|THE NATIONAL SERIALS DATA SYSTEM IN THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY.TRACES THE DEVELOPMENT OF REGIONAL COMPUTERISED UNION CATALOGUES OFPERIODICALS IN WEST GERMANY. THE TREND TOWARDS THE DEVELOPMENT OF A NATIONALUNION CATALOGUE, THE NATIONAL SERIALS DATA SYSTEM, WHEREBY THE REGIONALSYSTEMS ARE CONNECTED TO A NATIONAL DATA BASE IN WEST BERLIN IS DESCRIBED.
5366|AN ON-LINE REGIONAL UNION CATALOG OF MONOGRAPHS AND AUDIOVISUALS' ADEMONSTRATION PROJECT.THE PROJECT'S OBJECTIVE IS TO CREATE AN ON-LINE REGIONAL UNION CATALOGUE OFMONOGRAPHS AND AUDIOVISUAL MATERIALS USING EXISTING MACHINE READABLE RECORDSOF PARTICIPATING LIBRARIES CREATED IN A VARIETY OF SYSTEMS. THE RESULTANT FILEWILL BE SEARCHABLE BY AUTHOR, TITLE, SUBJECT AND KEYWORD, AND WILL FACILITATERESOURCE-SHARING BY EXPEDITING THE PROVISION OF MONOGRAPHS AND AUDIOVISUALMATERIALS WITHIN A 6|-STATE REGION OF THE USA; IT WILL FURTHER PROVIDE VALUABLESTATISTICAL INFORMATION FOR COORDINATING COLLECTION DEVELOPMENT. 1| IMPORTANTASPECT IS THE EXPEDITING OF INTERLIBRARY LOAN REQUESTS, BY AUTOMATICGENERATION AND THE STORAGE IN MASSAGE FILES FOR THE HOLDING LIBRARY, WITHOUTTHE REKEYBOARDING OF DATA.
5367|A WONDERFUL TOY.THE DANISH TECHNICAL LIBRARY AT THE DANISH TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY SET UP A DATABASE IN 1968| CONTAINING LOCATIONS OF THE LIBRARY'S OWN HOLDINGS. AT THE END OFTHE 70|S THIS FACILITY WAS EXPANDED TO AN ON-LINE SYSTEM OF LOCATING ALSO OTHERLIBRARIES' ACQUISITIONS AND CONNECTED TO SCANNET AND EURONET. DESCRIBES A NEWDEVELOPMENT OF THE SYSTEM, CALLED ALIS (AUTOMATED LIBRARY INFORMATION SYSTEM),INITIATED IN NOV 81|. IT IS NOW POSSIBLE TO REQUISITION TITLES THROUGH THE ALISCATALOGUES. THESE TITLES WILL BE THOSE READILY AVAILABLE, AS THE LIBRARY'SLOANS WILL BE REGISTERED IN THE TERMINAL FROM 1982|. USE OF ALIS IS FREE. THESYSTEM, DESCRIBED DIAGRAMMATICALLY, CONSISTS OF A LOCAL SYSTEM FORADMINISTRATION OF LOANS, AND THE I/S DATACENTRALEN'S FREE TEXT STANDARD SEARCHSYSTEM.
5368|SOME CURRENT ISSUES IN PLANNING FOR LIBRARY AUTOMATION AT THE STATE LEVEL.THE CONNECTICUT AUTOMATION COORDINATING COMMITTEE (CACC) WAS FORMED IN 1980| TOPROVIDE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL GROUPS, LIBRARIES AND ORGANISATIONS ENGAGED INOR INTERESTED IN DEVELOPING AUTOMATED SYSTEMS TO MEET REGULARLY TO SHAREINFORMATION AND TO BEGIN AN INFORMAL PLANNING EFFORT. DISCUSSES MAJOR ISSUESTHAT THE CACC HAS FACED WHICH HAVE IMPLICATIONS FOR OTHER STATES. A STATEWIDEON-LINE UNION CATALOGUE IS LIKELY TO CONSIST OF COMPONENTS DEVELOPEDINDEPENDENTLY BY INDIVIDUAL LIBRARIES OR GROUPS OF LIBRARIES WHICH HAVEVOLUNTARILY ADOPTED GUIDELINES AND STANDARDS SUGGESTED BY THE CACC. THE ROLEOF THE CACC IS THE IDENTIFICATION OF EXISTING AND EMERGING CATALOGUES WHICHMIGHT BECOME COMPONENTS, THE PROMOTION OF ADEQUATE ACCESS TO THOSE COMPONENTSAND THE ASSURANCE THAT THERE IS A REASONABLE PROSPECT OF EVENTUAL LINKAGE ANDINTEGRATION OF THOSE COMPONENTS.
5369|A LONG FAREWELL TO 'NARROW' CATCHWORDS.THE USE OF 'NARROW' CATCHWORDS AS A PRINCIPLE ELEMENT IN CATCHWORD CATALOGUESIS NO LONGER ACCEPTABLE. THE TERM 'NARROW' IS TOO VAGUE AND DOES NOT CONVEYTHE CONTENT AND MEANING WHICH IT SHOULD. THE PRINCIPLE OF THE 'NARROW'CATCHWORD HAS ALWAYS BEEN REGARDED AS DEFINING A CLASSIFICATION METHOD; THISIS HOWEVER, NOT THE CASE. LIBRARIES WOULD BE ADVISED TO CONFORM WITH STANDARDTERMINOLOGY USED IN DOCUMENTATION AND INFORMATION SCIENCE AND TO AVOID FURTHERUSE OF THE 'NARROW' CATCHWORD OR 'NARROW' TERM. THE CONTROL OF CLASSIFICATIONTERMINOLOGY IS A VERY IMPORTANT AREA OF LIBRARY SCIENCE WHICH SHOULD BE MORECLEARLY DEFINED. EXAMINING SUCH TERMS AS THE PRINCIPLE OF THE 'NARROW'CATCHWORD IS, THEREFORE, 1| STEP TOWARDS ELIMINATING TERMINOLOGY WHICH HAS NOREAL MEANING OR USE.
5370|A MODEL FOR A WEIGHTED RETRIEVAL SYSTEM.RECENT ARTICLES HAVE ANALYSED RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS WITH CONTINUOUS WEIGHTS OFVARIOUS TYPES AND/OR WITH A BOOLEAN STRUCTURE FOR THE QUERIES. THEY HAVE ALSOSUGGESTED CRITERIA WHICH SUCH SYSTEMS OUGHT TO SATISFY AND RECORD EVALUATIONMECHANISMS WHICH PARTIALLY SATISFY THESE CRITERIA. OFFERS A MORE CAREFULANALYSIS, BASED ON A GENERALISATION OF THE DISCRETE WEIGHTS. ALSO LOOKS AT THEWEIGHTS FROM AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT APPROACH INVOLVING THRESHOLDS, ANDGENERATES AN IMPROVED EVALUATION MECHANISM WHICH SEEMS TO FULFIL A LARGERSUBSET OF THE DESIRED CRITERIA THAN PREVIOUS MECHANISMS. THIS NEW MECHANISMALLOWS THE USER TO ATTACH A 'THRESHOLD' TO THE QUERY TERM.
5371|A COMPARISON OF TWO SYSTEMS OF WEIGHTED BOOLEAN RETRIEVAL.A MAJOR DEFICIENCY OF TRADITIONAL BOOLEAN SYSTEMS IS THEIR INABILITY TOREPRESENT THE VARYING DEGREES TO WHICH A DOCUMENT MAY BE WRITTEN ON A SUBJECT.IN THIS ARTICLE A NUMBER OF CRITERIA THAT SHOULD BE MET BY ANY BOOLEAN SYSTEMGENERALISED TO HAVE A WEIGHTING CAPABILITY ARE ISOLATED. IT IS PROVEN THATONLY 1| WEIGHTING RULE SATISFIES THESE CONDITIONS; THAT ASSOCIATED WITHFUZZY-SET THEORY; AND THAT THIS WEIGHTING SCHEME SATISFIES MOST OF THE OTHERPROPERTIES ASSOCIATED WITH BOOLEAN ALGEBRA AS WELL. PROBABILISTIC WEIGHTING ISTHEN INTRODUCED AS AN ALTERNATIVE APPROACH AND THE 2| SYSTEMS COMPARED. IN THELIMIT OF ZERO/1| WEIGHTS, ALL SYSTEMS CONSIDERED CONVERGE TO TRADITIONALBOOLEAN RETRIEVAL.
5372|THE LONGER THE NUMBER, THE SMALLER THE SPINE' OR, UP AND DOWN WITH MELVIL ANDELSIE.DISCUSSES THE PARADOX OF TRADITIONAL LIBRARY CLASSIFICATION' THE AIM OFEXPRESSING ON SUBJECT IN DETAIL IS IN CONFLICT WITH THE AIM OF PROVIDING ANINEXPENSIVE AND USEFUL DEVICE BY WHICH BOOKS CAN BE SHELVED AND RETRIEVED.SUGGESTS THE USE OF 2| DIFFERENT SCHEMES (OR 2| LEVELS OF THE SAME SCHEME). THE1|ST SCHEME WOULD PROVIDE CLASSIFICATION NUMBERS OF REASONABLE LENGTHS TOARRANGE ITEMS IN BROAD SUBJECT GROUPS WHILST THE 2|ND SCHEME (OR VARIANT OF THE1|ST) WOULD PROVIDE LONGER NUMBERS FOR DETAILED SUBJECT ACCESS ANDCOMPREHENSIVE BROWSING CAPABILITY IN ON-LINE SYSTEMS. THESE SCHEMES COULD BEAPPLIED TO ALL TYPES OF LIBRARY MATERIALS.
5373|CLASSIFICATION AND SUBJECT INDICATION' HIGHLIGHTS OF THE ANGLO-AMERICANDEBATE, 1850|-1950|.DISCUSSES THE DEVELOPMENT OF UK AND US IDEAS ON SUBJECT HEADINGS ANDCLASSIFICATION FROM THE TIME OF PANIZZI'S CHALLENGE TO CLASSIFIED CATALOGUINGTHROUGH THE PRACTICAL APPROACH OF CUTTER AND HULME TO THE WORK OF BLISS.CUTTER AND HULME NEVER FULLY DEVELOPED THEIR PRACTICAL APPROACH, LEAVING THEWAY CLEAR FOR THE THEORETICAL CLASSIFICATIONISTS SUCH AS OTLET AND RICHARDSON.UNIVERSAL DECIMAL CLASSIFICATION WAS THE MANIFESTATION OF THEIR PRINCIPLES ANDALSO THE BEGINNING OF A DECISIVE HISTORICAL MOVEMENT THAT CULMINATES IN THEWORK OF BLISS. HIS GREAT VALUE IS THAT HE OFFERS AN INDEPENDENT PERSPECTIVE ONTHE HISTORY OF CLASSIFICATION AND SUBJECT INDICATION AND IS REASONABLYENCOURAGING ABOUT COLON CLASSIFICATION, THE SYSTEM THAT ENDED THE FORMATIVECLASSIFICATIONIST PERIOD IN ANGLO-AMERICAN THOUGHT.
5374|CONFERENCE ON THE APPLICATION OF THE SOVIET LIBRARY-BIBLIOGRAPHICALCLASSIFICATION BY RESEARCH LIBRARIES IN THE GDR.A CONFERENCE WAS HELD AT THE GREIFSWALD UNIVERSITY LIBRARY ON 20| NOV 80| ON THEAPPLICATION OF THE SOVIET LIBRARY BIBLIOGRAPHICAL CLASSIFICATION (BBK) SYSTEMBY RESEARCH LIBRARIES IN EAST GERMANY. THE PURPOSE OF THE CONFERENCE WAS TOBRING TOGETHER MEMBERS OF RESEARCH LIBRARIES WHICH HAD INTRODUCED BBK TODISCUSS THEIR EXPERIENCES IN THE APPLICATION OF THE SYSTEM. AS THE GREIFSWALDUNIVERSITY LIBRARY HAD THE MOST EXPERIENCE IN THIS FIELD (19| YEARS) THEY TOOKTHE INITIATIVE IN CONVENING THE CONFERENCE. MEMBERS OF DIFFERENT LIBRARIESGAVE TALKS ON VARIOUS ASPECTS AND PROBLEMS OF INTRODUCING BBK. ALL THEADVANTAGES OF BBK SHOULD BE USED WHEN ADAPTING IT TO AN EXISTINGCLASSIFICATION SYSTEM AND THE MINIMUM NUMBER OF CHANGES MADE. SOME OF THEPROBLEMS DISCUSSED WERE' ADAPTATIONS NECESSARY IN SUBJECTS SUCH AS SOCIALSCIENCES, MARXISM-LENINISM, BIOPHYSICS, BIOCHEMISTRY AND MOLECULAR  BIOLOGY;THE PROBLEMS OF THE FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OF BBK AND EXPERIENCES INRECLASSIFYING A SYSTEMATIC CATALOGUE ACCORDING TO THE BBK SYSTEM.
5375|LIVING WITH DDC 19|; NOT LIVING WITH DDC 19|.PRESENTS REACTIONS OF 2| LIBRARIANS TO RECLASSIFYING THEIR LIBRARIES ACCORDINGTO THE 19|TH EDITION OF THE DEWEY DECIMAL CLASSIFICATION. ELIZABETH DICKINSONDESCRIBES HOW STOCKTON PUBLIC LIBRARY (CALIFORNIA) BEGAN THE PROCESS OFADAPTATION ALMOST AS SOON AS THE NEW EDITION WAS PUBLISHED AND OUTLINES THEWORKING PRINCIPLES, PUBLIC IMPACT AND CRITIQUES AND RESPONSES WITH LESSONSTHAT HAVE BEEN LEARNED. FOR JOSEPHINE RINE AT MINNEAPOLIS COMMUNITY COLLEGE(MINNESOTA), WITH ONLY A SMALL STAFF, RECLASSIFICATION IS AN IMPOSSIBLE DREAM.
5376|THE COLON IN UDC.IN UDC A LARGE NUMBER OF SYMBOLS ARE USED TO FORM THE COMPLEX NOTATION. MOSTOF THESE SYMBOLS HAVE SEVERAL POSSIBLE MEANINGS WHICH CAUSE PROBLEMS,ESPECIALLY IN THE CASE OF THE COLON, WHEN UDC IS USED IN AN AUTOMATEDINFORMATION SYSTEM. THE COLON IS CLEARLY INTENDED AS A SIGN DENOTING ARELATIONSHIP NEEDING NO FURTHER DEFINITION BETWEEN 2| NUMBERS. THE USE OF THECOLON WITH MORE THAN 2| UDC NUMBERS, ALTHOUGH UNOFFICIAL, HAS BECOMEWIDESPREAD; THE RANGE OF PERMITTED PERMUTATIONS IS DESCRIBED. WHERE THE COLONMAY BE USED BETWEEN 2| NUMBERS, THE POSSIBLE REVERSIBILITY OF THE RELATIONSHIPMAY BE TAKEN FOR GRANTED. IF THE POSSIBILITY OF PERMUTATION IS REMOVED THENTHE COLON RESUMES ITS ORIGINAL FUNCTION OF DENOTING A HIERARCHIC RELATIONSHIPBETWEEN 2| OR MORE UDC NUMBERS.
5377|MACRO- AND MICROTHESAURI' CHANGES OCCURRING IN MESH-DERIVED THESAURI AND ASOLUTION TO SOME RELATED SEARCH HANDICAPS.EXPLORES CHANGES THAT CAN OCCUR DURING THE CREATION OF A DERIVATIVE THESAURUS.A TERM TRANSLATION DICTIONARY IS PROPOSED TO AID MESH-TRAINED AND OTHERSEARCHERS WHO WOULD BE USING THE CANCER INFORMATION THESAURUS.
5378|QUANTITATIVE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN DESCRIPTORS AND NON-DESCRIPTORS IN THESAURI.ABOUT 40| THESAURI OR COLLECTIONS OF SUBJECT TERMINOLOGY EQUIVALENT TO THESAURIWERE STUDIED WITH REGARD TO QUANTITY RATIOS BETWEEN DESCRIPTORS ANDNON-DESCRIPTORS OR BETWEEN DESCRIPTORS AND A TOTAL VOCABULARY. WITH THE HELPOF REGRESSION ANALYSIS, LINEAR CONNECTIONS WERE MADE WITH A STRONGLYEMPHASISED CORRELATION BETWEEN THE NUMBER OF DESCRIPTORS AND THENON-DESCRIPTORS. THEN THE NUMBER OF NON-DESCRIPTORS WAS FOUND TO INCREASE MORESLOWLY THAN THAT OF THE DESCRIPTORS, DEMONSTRATING THAT THE PROPORTION OFNON-DESCRIPTORS TO THE TOTAL VOCABULARY DECREASES AS THE NUMBER OF DESCRIPTORSINCREASES. THE INIS THESAURUS (INTERNATIONAL NUCLEAR INFORMATION SYSTEM) ISDESCRIBED IN RELATION TO THIS THEORY AND FOUND TO BE WELL PRODUCED.

5380|HISTORICAL FILM DOCUMENTATION AT THE NETHERLANDS INFORMATION SERVICE.THE COMPUTERISED FILM DOCUMENTATION SYSTEM BEING DEVELOPED FOR USE IN THE FILMARCHIVE OF THE RIJKIVOORLICHTINGSDIENST (RVD), THE NETHERLANDS INFORMATIONSERVICE, IS DESCRIBED. DISCUSSES THE HISTORY OF THE FILM COLLECTION AND THEDIFFICULTIES OF PROVIDING ACCESS TO THE VAST AMOUNTS OF IMPORTANT FILM. IBMSTAIRS WAS FOUND TO MEET THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE NEW SYSTEM, ALTHOUGH SOMEASPECTS, SUCH AS ALPHABETISATION AND REGISTER CONSTRUCTION, WERE TAKEN FROMTHE LITERATURE INFORMATION SYSTEM (LISA) DEVELOPED IN THE NETHERLANDS, AND THEOUTPUT FORMATS ARE BASED ON THE ISBD (NBM) FOR NON-BOOK MATERIALS AS FAR ASPOSSIBLE.
5381|USING MODERN LIBRARY AND BIBLIOGRAPHICAL CLASSIFICATION SCHEMES IN SPECIALISEDCOMPUTER-BASED INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS.THERE ARE 3| DIFFERENT APPROACHES TO THE USE OF INDEXING LANGUAGES BASED ONCLASSIFICATION SCHEMES FOR SEARCHING COMPUTER FILES FOR SUBJECT REQUESTS. THEMECHANICAL APPROACH SIMPLY EXTENDS THE PRINCIPLE OF THE CARD CATALOGUE; THECOORDINATED APPROACH USES AS A SEARCH FORMAT A LIST OF CLASSIFICATION FEATURESEACH SERVING A HEURISTIC FUNCTION; THE INTEGRAL APPROACH PROVIDES A SYNTHESISOF CLASSIFICATION AND WORD LANGUAGES WITHOUT THE DRAWBACKS OF THE OTHER 2|, ANDOFFERS THE MOST LONG-TERM POSSIBILITIES. DETAILED EXAMPLES SHOW THE OPERATIONOF EACH APPROACH.
5382|A TRANSLATING COMPUTER INTERFACE FOR END-USER OPERATION OF HETEROGENEOUSRETRIEVAL SYSTEMS. 1|. DESIGN.ON-LINE RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS MAY BE DIFFICULT TO USE, ESPECIALLY BY END USERS,BECAUSE OF HETEROGENEITY AND COMPLEXITY. INVESTIGATIONS HAVE CONCERNED THECONCEPT OF A TRANSLATING COMPUTER INTERFACE AS A MEANS TO SIMPLIFY ACCESS TO,AND OPERATION OF, HETEROGENEOUS BIBLIOGRAPHIC RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS AND DATABASES. THE INTERFACE ALLOWS USERS TO MAKE REQUESTS IN A COMMON LANGUAGE. THESEREQUESTS ARE TRANSLATED BY THE INTERFACE INTO THE APPROPRIATE COMMANDS FORWHATEVER SYSTEM IS BEING INTERROGATED. SYSTEM RESPONSES MAY ALSO BETRANSFORMED BY THE INTERFACE INTO A COMMON FORM BEFORE BEING GIVEN TO THEUSERS. THUS, THE NETWORK OF DIFFERENT SYSTEMS IS MADE TO LOOK LIKE A SINGLE'VIRTUAL' SYSTEM TO THE USER. THE INTERFACE ALSO PROVIDES INSTRUCTION ANDOTHER SEARCH AIDS FOR THE USER. PHILOSOPHY, DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF ANEXPERIMENTAL INTERFACE NAMED CONIT ARE DESCRIBED.
5383|A TRANSLATING COMPUTER INTERFACE FOR END-USER OPERATION OF HETEROGENEOUSRETRIEVAL SYSTEMS. 2|. EVALUATIONS.THE EVALUATION OF THE CONCEPT OF A TRANSLATING COMPUTER INTERFACE FORSIMPLIFYING OPERATION OF MULTIPLE, HETEROGENEOUS ON-LINE BIBLIOGRAPHICRETRIEVAL SYSTEMS HAS BEEN UNDERTAKEN. AN EXPERIMENTAL RETRIEVAL SYSTEM, NAMEDCONIT, WAS BUILT AND TESTED UNDER CONTROLLED CONDITIONS WITH INEXPERIENCED ENDUSERS. A DETAILED ANALYSIS OF THE EXPERIMENTAL USAGES SHOWED THAT USERS WEREABLE TO MASTER INTERFACE OPERATION SUFFICIENTLY WELL TO FIND RELEVANT DOCUMENTREFERENCES. SUCCESS WAS ATTRIBUTED, IN PART, TO A SIMPLE COMMAND LANGUAGE,ADEQUATE ON-LINE INSTRUCTION, AND A SIMPLIFIED NATURAL LANGUAGE, KEYWORD/STEMAPPROACH TO SEARCHING. IT IS CONCLUDED THAT OPERATIONAL INTERFACES OF THE TYPESTUDIED CAN PROVIDE FOR INCREASED USABILITY OF EXISTING SYSTEMS IN A COSTEFFECTIVE MANNER, ESPECIALLY FOR INEXPERIENCED END USERS WHO CANNOT EASILYAVAIL THEMSELVES OF EXPERT INTERMEDIARY SEARCHERS. FURTHERMO RE, MORE ADVANCEDINTERFACES BASED ON IMPROVED INSTRUCTION AND AUTOMATED SEARCH STRATEGYTECHNIQUES COULD FURTHER ENHANCE RETRIEVAL EFFECTIVENESS FOR A WIDE CLASS OFUSERS.

MORGAN.
5385|THE ON-LINE INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SERVICE AT METROPOLITAN BRADFORD LIBRARIES'ITS ESTABLISHMENT AND OPERATION, DECEMBER 1979|-SEPTEMBER 1981|.DESCRIBES THE ESTABLISHMENT AND EXPERIENCE OF THE ON-LINE INFORMATION SERVICEOPERATED BY METROPOLITAN BRADFORD LIBRARIES (UK) AS PART OF THE BRITISHLIBRARY FUNDED PROJECT SI/G/353|. THE TERMINAL WAS MAINLY USED TO CONDUCTSEARCHES IN RESPONSE TO ENQUIRIES FROM THE PUBLIC AND FROM MEDICAL PERSONNELWITHIN THE HEALTH DISTRICT, ALTHOUGH SOME STOCK REVISION AND BIBLIOGRAPHICALCHECKS WERE DONE.
5386|A STATE TRANSITION ANALYSIS OF ONLINE INFORMATION-SEEKING BEHAVIOR.STATISTICAL ANALYSES OF ON-LINE SEARCHING PATTERNS COMPARED THE USAGE OF AQUERY LANGUAGE BY VARIOUS GROUPS OF SEARCHERS. DATA WERE GATHERED BY ANEXPERIMENTAL PROJECT, INDIVIDUALIZED INSTRUCTION FOR DATA ACCESS (IIDA),CONCERNED WITH DEVELOPING AND TESTING A SYSTEM WHICH SERVES AS A TEACHER ANDASSISTANT TO USERS OF LOCKHEED'S DIALOG SYSTEM. SEQUENTIAL LISTINGS OF USERCOMMANDS WERE CLASSIFIED BY CORRESPONDING STATE CODES TO REPRESENT PHASES OFSEARCHING. ZERO- THROUGH 4|TH-ORDER MARKOVIAN ANALYSES OF INDIVIDUAL COMMANDSAND STRINGS OF LIKE COMMANDS WERE PERFORMED TO COMPARE SEARCHING PROCEDURESUSED BY 3| CLASSES OF USERS.
5387|THE IMPACT OF PRESTEL ON PUBLIC LIBRARY REFERENCE ACTIVITIES.DESCRIBES A PROJECT AIMED TO ASSESS THE IMPACT OF PRESTEL ON PUBLIC LIBRARYREFERENCE SERVICES FROM THE VIEWPOINT OF USERS AND LIBRARY STAFF, AS WELL ASCONSIDERING THE MANAGEMENT IMPLICATIONS SUCH AS STOCK ACQUISITION, BUDGET ANDSPACE USE. PRESTEL AND TELETEXT RECEIVERS WERE INSTALLED FOR 12| MONTHS INREFERENCE LIBRARIES IN THE LONDON BOROUGHS OF BEXLEY, HOUNSLOW, SUTTON ANDWALTHAM FOREST AND IN BIRMINGHAM AND NORWICH CENTRAL REFERENCE LIBRARIES.PRESTEL WAS FOUND TO BE A USEFUL SUPPLEMENT TO EXISTING RESOURCES FORSTATISTICAL, BUSINESS, NEWS AND LEISURE INFORMATION BUT THE STUDY INDICATEDFACTORS INHIBITING USE WHICH PRECLUDED MORE EXPERIMENTAL USE AND A MORETHOROUGH TESTING OF THEIR APPLICATION IN REFERENCE LIBRARIES.
5388|LOCAL COMMUNITY INFORMATION ON PRESTEL' USE OF THE BIRMINGHAM LOCALINFORMATION FILE.A BRITISH LIBRARY FUNDED MONITORING STUDY OF A LOCAL COMMUNITY INFORMATIONFILE ON PRESTEL, COVERING THE BIRMINGHAM AREA (UK). DATA WERE COLLECTED BYQUESTIONNAIRES SENT TO RESIDENTIAL USERS AND BY COLLECTING USE STATISTICS FROMTHE PRESTEL COMPUTERS. COVERS' FILE COMPOSITION AND DESIGN; COMPARATIVE USE OFDIFFERENT PARTS OF THE FILE; TOPIC PREFERENCE AMONG USERS; AND VOLUME OF USE.
5389|SHEDDING LIGHT ON TELETEXT.DISCUSSES THE USE OF TELETEXT IN THE UK AND PRESENTS THE FINDINGS OF A RECENTSURVEY OF TELETEXT USERS CARRIED OUT BY CIT (COMMUNICATIONS AND INFORMATIONTECHNOLOGY) RESEARCH (2|TELETEXT AND PRESTEL' USER REACTIONS1|). TELETEXTAPPEARS TO BE USED AS AN ADDITIONAL RATHER THAN ALTERNATIVE DATA SOURCE; ISACCESSED AN AVERAGE OF 1|-4| TIMES DAILY BY EACH USER; AND IS MOST OFTEN USEDFOR NEWS, WEATHER, TRAVEL, AND SPORT. 93|% OF USERS ARE SATISFIED, ALTHOUGH 29|%DESCRIBE IT AS INCOMPLETE. WARNS THAT CURRENT USERS ARE HIGHLY INNOVATIVE INTHEIR APPROACH AND MAY NOT BE TYPICAL OF FUTURE USERS. CONCLUDES THAT ADEFINITE CONSUMER MARKET EXISTS FOR TELETEXT.
5390|MACHINE-READABLE OUTPUT FROM ONLINE SEARCHES.MACHINE-READABLE OUTPUT (MRO) FROM ON-LINE SEARCHES IS USEFUL IN THECOMPILATION OF LARGE BIBLIOGRAPHIES. ARRANGEMENTS WERE MADE WITH A MAJORON-LINE RETRIEVAL VENDOR TO OBTAIN (FOR A FEE) OUTPUT IN THE FORM OF MAGNETICTAPE, RATHER THAN CONVENTIONAL OFF-LINE PRINTS ON PAPER. A PROGRAMME WASWRITTEN TO TRANSFORM AND PROCESS THE DATA; PART OF THIS PROGRAMME IS SIMILARTO A COMPUTER COMPILER. A METHOD OF CHECKING FOR DUPLICATE ITEMS WASDEVELOPED. MRO IS COST-EFFECTIVE AND ELIMINATES THE TIME-CONSUMING ANDLABOUR-INTENSIVE DATA ENTRY PROCESS. IT IS A NATURAL EXTENSION OF THE POWERSOF ON-LINE RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS.
5391|SWITCHING ON THE ELECTRONIC LIBRARY.BRIEFLY DISCUSSES THE COST OF USING 'ELECTRONIC LIBRARIES' (DATA BASES) ANDEXPLAINS WHY IT IS WORTH THE EXPENSE IN 3| AREAS-PATENTS, MEDICAL AND CHEMICALINFORMATION, AND THE LAW. REFERS TO THE PROBLEM OF CHOOSING APPROPRIATE TERMSIN A DATA BASE SEARCH AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF USER-FRIENDLY ALMOST-FOOLPROOFCOMPUTER SYSTEMS. CONCLUDES THAT, DESPITE THE DIFFICULTIES, THESE ELECTRONICLIBRARIES ARE STILL MUCH MORE CONVENIENT THAN SYSTEMS SUCH AS PRESTEL.
5392|ELECTRONIC PUBLISHING-SIZE, SHAPE, DILEMMAS OF ONLINE PUBLISHING.A BRIEF DISCUSSION ON THE PUBLISHING OF ON-LINE DATA BASES. CONSIDERS THEPRODUCTION AND PRICING OF PRINT AND MACHINE-READABLE FORMATS AS WELL AS THECHALLENGE OF FULL-TEXT ON-LINE SERVICES. AS THE GENERAL PUBLIC IS BECOMINGINFORMATION CONSCIOUS MORE DATA BASES OF POTENTIAL INTEREST TO THEM ARE BEINGDEVELOPED.
5393|LACK OF STANDARDIZATION OF THE JOURNAL TITLE DATA ELEMENT IN DATABASES.THE PROBLEM OF DATA ELEMENT REPRESENTATION IS MORE EXTENSIVE THAN MOSTPERCEIVE. THE NUMBER OF STANDARDS (INTERNAL, NATIONAL, AND INTERNATIONAL) ISLARGE, BUT THE USE OF STANDARDS IN DATA BASES IS NOT WIDESPREAD. THE RESULT ISA SIGNIFICANT LACK OF STANDARDISATION BOTH WITHIN AND ACROSS DATA BASES. THERESULT BECOMES APPARENT WHEN ONE ATTEMPTS AN EXHAUSTIVE SEARCH ON A PARTICULARDATA ELEMENT IN MULTIPLE DATA BASES. THE JOURNAL TITLE ELEMENT WAS STUDIED IN8| DATA BASES, AND 4| MEASURES WERE DEVELOPED TO SHOW THE EXTENT OFSTANDARDISATION WITHIN A DATA BASE AND SOME OF ITS IMPLICATIONS FOR SEARCHING.
5394|ADVANTAGES OF ON-LINE LITERATURE RESEARCH AND THE EXISTING AVAILABLE DATABASES.OBVIOUS ADVANTAGES OF ON-LINE LITERATURE RESEARCH COMPARED TO TRADITIONALMETHODS SUCH AS LIBRARY SUBJECT CATALOGUES ARE' THE RESEARCH RESULTS ARECOMPLETE; THE INFORMATION RETRIEVAL IS PRECISE DUE TO THE POSSIBILITY OFAND/OR COMBINATIONS; TIME IS SAVED AND THE RESEARCH RESULTS ARE AUTOMATICALLYPRINTED IN A HARDCOPY FORM INSTEAD OF HAVING TO BE PHOTOCOPIED OR HANDWRITTEN.IN WEST GERMANY, 75|% OF COMPUTER STORED LITERATURE REFERENCES I.E. 70| MILLIONDOCUMENT UNITS ARE AVAILABLE THROUGH NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL DATA BASES. 3|OF THE MOST IMPORTANT DATA BASES IN WEST GERMANY ARE DIMDI (DEUTSCHES INSTITUTFUR MEDIZINISCHE DOKUMENTATION UND INFORMATION, INKA (INFORMATIONSSYSTEMKARLSRUHE) AND GID (GESELLSCHAFT FUR INFORMATION UND DOKUMENTATION). THELARGEST INTERNATIONAL DATA BASES ARE LOCKHEED, THE EUROPEAN SPACE AGENCY (ESA)AND THE BRITISH LIBRARY AUTOMATED INFORMATION SERVICE (BLAISE).

5397|PRE-MED, THE BRS CURRENT CLINICAL MEDICINE DATABASE.PRE-MED IS A CURRENT CLINICAL MEDICINE FILE WHICH WAS DEVELOPED BYBIBLIOGRAPHIC RETRIEVAL SERVICES AS A COMPANION FILE TO MEDLINE. PRE-MEDCONTAINS CITATIONS FROM 109| JOURNALS IN CLINICAL MEDICINE, NURSING, ANDHOSPITAL LITERATURE. PRE-MED IS SIMILAR IN FORMAT TO MEDLINE AND IS UPDATEDWEEKLY WITH ABOUT 500| CITATIONS. PRE-MED INDEXERS SUPPLEMENT THE JOURNALS'TABLES OF CONTENTS WITH 2|MEDICAL SUBJECT HEADINGS1|. PRE-MED USES ILLUSTRATEDIN THIS ARTICLE INCLUDE BIBLIOGRAPHIC VERIFICATIONS, ACQUISITIONS SEARCHING,UPDATING A MEDLINE SEARCH, AND TABLES OF CONTENTS SERVICES.
5398|SEARCHING THE MEDLARS FILE FOR INFORMATION ON THE ELDERLY.BASED ON A PAPER PRESENTED AT THE NLM ON-LINE DATA BASES CLINIC, 11| FEB 81|. ASTHE ELDERLY POPULATION IN THE US INCREASES, THE CONSEQUENCES FOR THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM ARE SIGNIFICANT. THE VETERANS ADMINISTRATION (VA) HAS CREATED AGERIATRIC RESEARCH, EDUCATION, AND CLINICAL CENTRES PROGRAMME TO PROVIDE CARE,SUPPORT RESEARCH, AND TRAIN PRACTITIONERS IN GERIATRIC MEDICINE. THROUGH THEPARTICIPATION OF THE WADSWORTH VA MEDICAL CENTER LIBRARY IN THIS PROGRAMME,METHODOLOGIES HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED FOR SEARCHING NATIONAL LIBRARY OF MEDICINEDATA BASES FOR INFORMATION ON THE ELDERLY. THESE METHODOLOGIES ARE DESCRIBED;TERMS AND DEFINITIONS IN GERIATRICS ARE EXPLICATED; SAMPLE SEARCH REQUESTS AREEXPLORED; AND ON-LINE STRATEGIES ARE INDICATED.
5399|THE MEASUREMENT OF TERM IMPORTANCE IN AUTOMATIC INDEXING.THE FREQUENCY CHARACTERISTICS OF TERMS IN THE DOCUMENTS OF A COLLECTION HAVEBEEN USED AS INDICATORS OF TERM IMPORTANCE FOR CONTENT ANALYSIS AND INDEXINGPURPOSES. IN PARTICULAR, VERY RARE OR VERY FREQUENT TERMS ARE NORMALLYBELIEVED TO BE LESS EFFECTIVE THAN MEDIUM-FREQUENCY TERMS. RECENTLY AUTOMATICINDEXING THEORIES HAVE BEEN DEVISED THAT USE NOT ONLY THE TERM FREQUENCYCHARACTERISTICS BUT ALSO THE RELEVANCE PROPERTIES OF THE TERMS. THE MAJORTERM-WEIGHTING THEORIES ARE 1|ST BRIEFLY REVIEWED. THE TERM PRECISION AND TERMUTILITY WEIGHTS THAT ARE BASED ON THE OCCURRENCE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE TERMSIN THE RELEVANT, AS OPPOSED TO THE NONRELEVANT, DOCUMENTS OF A COLLECTION ARETHEN INTRODUCED. METHODS ARE SUGGESTED FOR ESTIMATING THE RELEVANCE PROPERTIESOF THE TERMS BASED ON THEIR OVERALL OCCURRENCE CHARACTERISTICS IN THECOLLECTION. FINALLY, EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION RESULTS ARE SHOWN COMPARING THEWEIGHTING SYSTEMS USING THE TERM RELEVANCE PROPERTIES WITH THE MORECONVENTIONAL FREQUENCY-BASED METHODOLOGIES.

5403|NAIVE USER IS BIG BUSINESS.AS THE DATA PROCESSING INDUSTRY SEARCHES OUT NEW MARKETS IN WHICH TO GROW, ITCOMES UP AGAINST A HOST OF NEW INEXPERT USERS. REPORTS ON DEVELOPMENTS INUSER-FRIENDLY SYSTEMS, INCLUDING SPEECH AND TOUCH INPUT. ARGUES THAT THEINDUSTRY WHICH SHOULD INVOLVE USERS IN THE SYSTEMS DESIGN FOR THE TRAINING OFDATA PROCESSING DESIGNERS HAS NEGLECTED ERGONOMICS.
5404|DP THROWS AWAY ITS DULL DRAB WEEDS.ASSESSES PLANS BY GOVERNMENT AND THE UK COMPUTER INDUSTRY TO EDUCATE THEPUBLIC AND MOST PARTICULARLY BUSINESSES IN THE BENEFITS OF INFORMATIONTECHNOLOGY DURING INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY YEAR.
5405|VISUAL LITERACY' A VITAL SKILL.THE ABILITY TO DRAW APPROPRIATE MEANING FROM A VISUAL REPRESENTATION (OFWHATEVER KIND) IS AN IMPORTANT INFORMATION SKILL. STUDENTS SHOULD BE ABLE TOINTERROGATE MAPS, DIAGRAMS, PAINTINGS, PHOTOGRAPHS AND OTHER VISUAL IMAGES,INCLUDING MOVING PICTURES, RECOGNISING SPECIFIC CONVENTIONS IN USE AND THEIRLIMITATIONS. CRITICAL EXAMINATION OF CONTENT AND CONTEXT, THE IMPLICATIONS OFSUPPORTING TEXTUAL OR AURAL ACCOMPANIMENT, AND AN UNDERSTANDING OF THEPOSSIBILITIES OF MANIPULATION AND BIAS, NEED TO BE CAREFULLY NURTURED. THEVALUE OF PICTORIAL SOURCES FOR PRIMARY RESEARCH DATA IS EMPHASISED.
5406|PUBLIC SCHOOL SATISFACTION OF INDIANA ESEA TITLE IV-B ADMINISTRATION, 1979|-80|.REPORT OF THE STUDY CONDUCTED IN INDIANA TO DETERMINE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THEDIVISION OF INSTRUCTIONAL MEDIA IN ADMINISTERING THE ESEA IV-B PROGRAMME INTHE PUBLIC SCHOOLS. STRONG POSITIVE SATISFACTION WAS SHOWN FOR THE DIVISION'SADMINISTRATION OF THE PROGRAMME, AND THERE WAS NO INDICATION THAT MAJORCHANGES ARE REQUIRED IN ITS IV-B ACTIVITIES. IMMEDIATE CONSIDERATION SHOULD BEGIVEN TO THE RECOMMENDATIONS, BUT ALL ARE MINOR ADJUSTMENTS OR REDIRECTION OFACTIVITIES TAKING PLACE AS PART OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE FUNCTION OF THE INDIANAESEA IV-B PROGRAMME.
5407|COMPARATIVE HIGHER EDUCATION' A BIBLIOGRAPHICAL REVIEW.IDENTIFIES SOME MAJOR ISSUES WHICH HAVE BEEN THE SUBJECT OF COMPARATIVERESEARCH INTO HIGHER EDUCATION, AS EVIDENCED IN THE LITERATURE. COMMON ORIGINSOF HIGHER EDUCATION ARE NOTED. THE LITERATURE OF POST-1945| DEVELOPMENTS ISSURVEYED, WITH PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO THE EXPANSION OF HIGHER EDUCATION,ACCESS AND DEMOCRATISATION, POLITICISATION OF UNIVERSITIES, POLICY RESPONSES,AND RESEARCH.

5409|A SYSTEM OF MEASURING THE DYNAMICS OF READING.THE DYNAMICS OF READING CAN BE DEFINED AS CHANGES IN READING HABITS PRODUCEDAS A RESULT OF SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT. THE LAST 15| YEARS HAVE SEEN MUCH RESEARCHIN THIS FIELD, BUT ALL HAS BEEN RELATED TO SPECIFIC TIMES AND LOCATIONS. THEREIS A GROWING NEED FOR A GENERAL FRAMEWORK OF REFERENCE, AND THIS PAPERATTEMPTS TO REVIEW SOME OF THE METHODOLOGICAL PROBLEMS INVOLVED. ONE SOLUTIONTO THE CHIEF PROBLEM, THAT OF MEASURING READING DYNAMICS, WAS SUGGESTED BY ARESEARCH PROJECT AT THE LENIN STATE LIBRARY, WHICH DISCERNED 3| INDICATORS OFCHANGE; PREVALENCE OF READING, ACTIVENESS AND CONTENT.
5410|RESEARCH INTO THE READING HABITS OF SOVIET YOUNG PEOPLE IN THE 1920|S.WITH THE RECOGNITION TODAY OF THE SUPREME IMPORTANCE OF WORK WITH CHILDREN,NEW ATTENTION IS BEING PAID TO THE EARLY ATTEMPTS TO STUDY THE READINGBEHAVIOUR OF YOUNG PEOPLE IN THE 1920|S. BOTH LENIN AND KRUPSKAYA STRESSED THENEED FOR SOVIET LIBRARIANS TO GET TO KNOW THE NEEDS AND THE BACKGROUNDS OF THEPEOPLE THEY WERE TRYING TO SERVE, BUT EARLY PUBLISHED RESEARCH INTO YOUNGPEOPLE'S READING TENDED TO BE MORE ENTHUSIASTIC THAN ACCURATE. IN LATER WORKTHE METHODOLOGY IMPROVED AND THE BASIS WAS LAID DOWN FOR MUCH OF TODAY'SRESEARCH.
5411|ORGANISING CHILDREN'S BOOK CLUB.SUGGESTS THAT LIBRARIES, SCHOOLS, AND PUBLISHERS IN NIGERIA SHOULD SET UPPAPERBACK BOOK CLUBS WITH THE AIM OF ENCOURAGING CHILDREN TO READ FORPLEASURE.

THESTATE CAN PROVIDE GRANTS TO LEVEL OUT STANDARDS BUT DOES NOT INTERFERE IN THERUNNING OF LOCAL LIBRARIES, AND SWEDEN HAS NO LIBRARIES ACT. MUNICIPALAUTHORITIES THEMSELVES DECIDE THE OBJECTIVES, SCALE AND STRUCTURE OF THEIRLIBRARY SERVICES. ALL OF SWEDEN'S 279| MUNICIPALITIES PROVIDE MUNICIPAL LIBRARYSERVICES. CERTAIN LIBRARY FUNCTIONS WOULD BE TOO EXPENSIVE TO OPERATE ON APURELY MUNICIPAL BASIS-IT IS THEREFORE RATIONAL AND EFFICIENT TO TRANSFERTHESE TO THE REGIONAL OR SUPRAMUNICIPAL-THAT IS, COUNTY-LEVEL.
5683|PLANNING A WAGON LIBRARY SERVICE FOR THE SR-6| STATE RAILWAY NETWORK, RIOGRANDE DO SUL, BRAZIL.A PROJECT PRESENTED TO THE BRAZILIAN RAILWAY BORAD IN 1980|, BASED ON PREVIOUSEXPERIENCE WITH MOBILE LIBRARIES. THE WAGON LIBRARY WOULD CIRCULATE THROUGHOUTTHE NETWORK HOOKED UP TO A PASSENGER TRAIN; THE POTENTIAL BENEFITS INPROMOTING READING ARE DISCUSSED, AND DETAILS GIVEN OF THE ESTIMATED STAFF,STOCK, AND EQUIPMENT REQUIRED. PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATING AND CONTROLLING THESERVICE ARE OUTLINED, AND A VARIETY OF ADDITIONAL EXTENSION ACTIVITIES WHICHCOULD OPERATE FROM THE WAGON AS A BASE SUGGESTED.
5684|INVISIBLE COLLEGES AS A BASIS FOR PLANNING SPECIAL LIBRARY SERVICES. A REVIEWOF THE LITERATURE.EXPLAINS HOW INVISIBLE COLLEGES FACILITATE TRANSMISSION OF INFORMATION AMONGMEMBERS OF SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITIES, CITING PUBLISHED RESEARCH AS EVIDENCE.THERE IS NO EVIDENCE IN THE LITERATURE TO SHOW THAT LIBRARIANS HAVECAPITALISED ON THIS PHENOMENON. PROPOSES THAT INFORMATION CENTRES IDENTIFY THEINTERESTS OF USER COMMUNITIES AND KEEP FILES ON THEIR ACTIVITIES,DISSEMINATING THIS INFORMATION AS PART OF THEIR REFERENCE SERVICES.
5685|WHICH WAY FOR SCHOOL MEDIA SERVICES TO TURN?.IN THE NETHERLANDS THERE HAS BEEN MUCH DISCUSSION IN RECENT YEARS ON THETRANSFER OF SCHOOL LIBRARY SERVICES FROM THE PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVICE TO THERESPONSIBILITY OF THE LOCAL EDUCATION AUTHORITIES. IN THE PRESENT SITUATION OFCUTBACKS IN PUBLIC LIBRARY FINANCES THERE IS CONSIDERABLE SUPPORT FOR SUCH ATRANSFER. HOWEVER, SCHOOL LIBRARIANS EMPLOYED BY THE PUBLIC LIBRARYAUTHORITIES, ARE AS MUCH A PART OF THE SCHOOL 'SUPPORT' STAFF AS EDUCATIONALPSYCHOLOGISTS AND SOCIAL WORKERS ALSO FOUND IN SCHOOLS. LIBRARIANS EXPERIENCEDIN THE PROVISION OF CHILDREN'S LIBRARY SERVICES ARE IN THE BEST POSITION TOORGANISE SCHOOL LIBRARIES WITH THEIR GROWING COLLECTIONS OF AUDIO-VISUALMATERIALS AS WELL AS THEIR BOOKSTOCK.
5686|LIBRARY NETWORK IN THE SLOVAK SOCIALIST REPUBLIC AND ITS FUTURE DEVELOPMENT.THE RECENT COMMUNIST PARTY CONGRESS AND REQUIREMENTS OF THE 7|TH 5|-YEAR-PLAN(1981|-85|) HAVE GIVEN A NEW IMPETUS TO THE WHOLE LIBRARY NETWORK IN SLOVAKIA.SINCE 1| JAN 82|, A SPECIAL SECTION OF MATICA SLOVENSKA, BASED IN BRATISLAVA,HAS BEEN IN OPERATION. ITS STAFF HAVE TO WATCH, DIRECT AND CONTROL BOTH SHORT-AND LONG-TERM PLANNING IN LIBRARIES. THEY WILL ALSO CARE FOR COORDINATIONBETWEEN LIBRARIES AND CENTRES OF SCIENTIFIC, TECHNICAL AND ECONOMICINFORMATION. CONTACTS WITH LIBRARIES IN THE CZECH SOCIALIST REPUBLIC AS WELLAS INTERNATIONAL CONNECTIONS WILL ALSO BE FURTHERED. THE OVERALLRESPONSIBILITY FOR LIBRARIES, HOWEVER, RESTS UPON THE SLOVAK MINISTRY OFCULTURE. FOR THEIR PART, THE MINISTRY'S OFFICIALS WILL MAKE EVERY EFFORTTOWARDS UNIFICATION AND/OR STANDARDISATION OF ALL LIBRARY ACTIVITIES,INCLUDING BUILDING UP BOOK COLLECTIONS, RECORDS, STATISTICS AND THE LIKE.AMONG OTHER PROBLEMS WHICH MUST BE TACKLED IN  THE FORSEEABLE FUTURE ARECOMPUTERISATION, MERGERS OF PUBLIC AND SCHOOL LIBRARIES, WHERE APPROPRIATE,AND INCORPORATION OF PUBLIC LIBRARIES INTO LOCAL CULTURAL INSTITUTIONS.
5687|NETWORKS.REVISED VERSION OF A PAPER PRESENTED TO A MEETING ON REGIONAL LIBRARYCOOPERATION IN DEVENTER, 19| NOV 81|. IN THE NETHERLANDS COOPERATION AMONGSTLIBRARIES OF ALL TYPES HAS COME UNDER CLOSE EXAMINATION AS A RESULT OF THEINCLUSION OF PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVICES IN THE PROPOSED PUBLIC SERVICES ACT. THECONCEPT OF LIBRARY NETWORKS DATES FROM THE EARLY 1900|S WHEN THE NEED FORLIBRARIES TO SHARE THEIR RESOURCES WAS RECOGNISED. THE MOST EFFECTIVE LIBRARYNETWORKS ARE THOSE NETWORKS WHICH OPERATE THEIR SERVICES ON A FINANCIAL BASIS.IN ADDITION, THE COORDINATION OF ACQUISITION POLICIES, CATALOGUING SERVICESAND INTERLIBRARY LENDING AMONGST MEMBERS OF A LIBRARY NETWORK REQUIRES THEMOST UP-TO-DATE TELECOMMUNICATION AND COMPUTER EQUIPMENT. WITHIN EACH NETWORKA CENTRAL LIBRARY SHOULD BE DESIGNATED TO ACT AS A CLEARING-HOUSE FOR THETRANSFER OF INFORMATION.
5688|EXTRA-MURAL FUNCTIONS OF UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES.FOR OVER 10| YEARS PUBLIC LIBRARIES HAVE BEEN BUYING MORE ACADEMIC LITERATURETHAN BEFORE AND UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES OFFERING THE USE OF THEIR FACILITIES TOPEOPLE OUTSIDE THE UNIVERSITY. THIS EXTRA-MURAL WORK MUST NOT BE REDUCEDBECAUSE OF FINANCIAL PROBLEMS; THE OBVIOUS NEED FOR ACADEMIC MATERIAL MUST BESATISFIED AND INTER-LIBRARY LOANS AND PURCHASING SCHEMES MUST RESULT IN ABETTER COORDINATED AND MORE ECONOMICAL USE OF LITERATURE. THE BUILDING UP OFUNION CATALOGUES USING ELECTRONIC DATA PROCESSING AND OF DECENTRALISEDMICROFICHE AND SCREEN TEXT SERVICES WILL EASE THE DEMAND ON UNIVERSITY SPECIALCOLLECTIONS. ISOLATION OF UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES WILL NOT IMPROVE THEIR PUBLICIMAGE AND COULD PROVE COSTLY.
5689|THE WORK OF THE STUDY GROUP OF DIRECTORS OF UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES.IN THE LIBRARY SYSTEM OF EAST GERMANY, THE UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES OF BERLIN,DRESDEN, GREIFSWALD, HALLE, JENA, LEIPZIG AND ROSTOCK PLAY AN IMPORTANT PARTIN INTER-LIBRARY LOAN SCHEMES AND IN THE ACQUISITION OF SPECIALISED STOCKS. IN1980| THESE UNIVERSITIES OWNED TOTAL STOCKS OF 18| MILLION ITEMS. THE STUDYGROUP PROVIDES ADVICE ON ORGANISATION, WITH PARTICULAR REFERENCE TO THEDEVELOPMENT OF THE UNIFIED SYSTEM OF A CENTRAL UNIVERSITY LIBRARY WITHASSOCIATED BRANCHES AND PROMOTES EXCHANGES AND ANALYSES OF EXPERIENCE. THEGROUP IS CURRENTLY CONCENTRATING ON INTER-LIBRARY COOPERATION WITHIN SUBJECTNETWORKS, WITH A VIEW TO IMRPOVING PURCHASING POLICY. IMPROVEMENTS MUST ALSOBE MADE IN THE COOPERATION BETWEEN UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES, INFORMATION CENTRESAND RESEARCH, IN USER TRAINING AND IN THE APPLICATION OF TECHNOLOGY.
5690|THE COLOMBIAN UNIVERSITY LIBRARY NETWORK.A FULL PRESENTATION OF THE ORGANISATION AND OPERATION OF THE COLOMBIANINTER-UNIVERSITY SYSTEM, SHOWING HOW IT WAS CREATED TO INTEGRATE EXISTINGINITIATIVES AND IMPLEMENT A NATIONAL INFORMATION POLICY OF COOPERATION ANDRESOURCE SHARING. THE NETWORK'S STRUCTURE IS DESIGNED TO MAXIMISE USE OFAVAILABLE RESOURCES AT NATIONAL, REGIONAL AND LOCAL LEVELS; DETAILS ARE GIVENOF MEMBERSHIP AND ADMINISTRATION. 16| PROGRAMMES CURRENTLY IN PROGRESS AREOUTLINED; THESE INCLUDE PROJECTS FOR A NATIONAL UNION PERIODICALS CATALOGUE,INTERLIBRARY LOAN, DUPLICATES EXCHANGE, COOPERATIVE CATALOGUING, CATALOGUINGIN PUBLICATION, PREPARATION OF DIRECTORIES AND GUIDES, AND TRAINING OF BOTHPERSONNEL AND USERS.
5691|INTERACTION WITHIN THE TECHNICAL REPORTS COMMUNITY.THERE IS A GROWING INTERDEPENDENCE AMONG THE MAJOR US FEDERAL TECHNICALREPORTS PROCESSING AGENCIES, THE SCIENCE/TECHNOLOGY LIBRARIES/INFORMATIONCENTRES AND COMMERCIAL SERVICES WITH WHICH THEY INTERACT. IN THISINTERCONNECTED INFORMATION NETWORK, THE PARTICIPANTS BOTH FEED AND USE THESYSTEM TO FULFIL THEIR MISSIONS IN REGARD TO TRANSFERRING GOVERNMENT RESEARCHAND DEVELOPMENT RESULTS. COOPERATIVE ARRANGEMENTS AMONG THE PARTICIPANTS ANDSHARING OF RESOURCES ARE BECOMING INCREASINGLY IMPERATIVE IN ORDER TO LOWERCOSTS AND INCREASE EFFICIENCY. RECENT STEPS TAKEN TOWARDS THESE ARE DESCRIBED.
5692|BACKGROUND TO THE COLOMBIAN LAW 11| OF 5| MARCH 1979| 'RECOGNISING THE PROFESSIONOF LIBRARIANSHIP AND REGULATING ITS EXERCISE'.DESCRIBES THE PREPARATION AND PRESENTATION OF EARLY VERSIONS OF THE COLOMBIANLAW NOW IN FORCE.

THE TEXT OF THE LAW IS APPENDED.
5693|DRAFT OF A NEW LIBRARY BILL' AMPUTATED CENTRAL ADMINISTRATION AND MANYPOSSIBILITIES OF DISPENSATION.THIS DRAFT, ISSUED BY THE DANISH MINISTRY OF CULTURAL AFFAIRS IN APR 81|, TOBECOME LAW AT THE EARLIEST JAN 83|, OPERATES WITH A COMPLICATED CENTRALADMINISTRATION, CONSISTING OF A CHIEF ADMINISTRATOR PRESIDING OVER A RESEARCHLIBRARY AND A PUBLIC LIBRARY DIRECTORATE, EACH WITH A LIBRARY BOARD. SOMELARGE RESEARCH LIBRARIES AT PRESENT UNDER A DIFFERENT MINISTRY FROM THEMINISTRY OF CULTURE, WILL REMAIN OUTSIDE THE CENTRAL CONTROL, ALTHOUGH GENERALDEVELOPMENT PLANNING FOR ALL RESEARCH LIBRARIES IS TO BE CENTRALLYADMINISTERED. THERE WILL BE NO DIRECT STATE FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR PUBLICLIBRARIES IN GENERAL, BUT SOME SPECIFIED LIBRARIES AND ACTIVITIES WILL RECEIVESTATE GRANTS. THE JOINT APPROPRIATION IS TO REMAIN AND WILL INCLUDE THEPRESENT DISPENSATION FUND. DATES ARE SET FOR THE INTRODUCTION OF FULL TIMESERVICE AND OF MUSICAL MATERIAL IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES.
5694|IN CONVERSATION WITH THE MINISTER FOR CULTURE, RECREATION AND SOCIAL AFFAIRS,HANS DE BOER.TEXT OF AN INTERVIEW WITH HANS DE BOER, MINISTER FOR CULTURE, RECREATION ANDSOCIAL AFFAIRS IN THE NETHERLANDS. DE BOER FIRMLY SUPPORTS THE NEW PUBLICSERVICES ACT WHICH WILL DECENTRALISE RUNNING OF THE PUBLIC SERVICES, INCLUDINGPUBLIC LIBRARIES, FROM NATIONAL TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT LEVEL. DE BOER BELIEVESTHAT INVOLVEMENT OF THE LOCAL COMMUNITY IN THE RUNNING OF THESE SERVICES ISTHE BEST GUARANTEE FOR IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF THE SERVICE. PLANS FOREXTENDING THE AGE LIMIT FOR FREE PUBLIC LIBRARY MEMBERSHIP FROM 16| TO 18| YEARSOF AGE HAVE BEEN ABANDONED BY DE BOER BECAUSE OF FINANCIAL CUTBACKS INGOVERNMENT SUPPORT. THE ALTERNATIVE, DE BOER BELIEVES, WOULD HAVE BEEN AREDUCTION IN THE STANDARD OF SERVICE.

POSTMA, CHAIRMAN OF THE NBLC ON THE 10|THANNIVERSARY OF THE FOUNDING OF THE CENTRE. POSTMA BELIEVES THAT LIBRARIANS INTHE NETHERLANDS SHOULD NOW COME TO TERMS WITH THE NEW PUBLIC SERVICES ACT,WHICH WILL REPLACE THE EXISTING PUBLIC LIBRARIES ACT. BY REFUSING TO ACCEPTTHE ACT LIBRARIANS ARE IN DANGER OF BEING LEFT OUT IN THE COLD. IN POSTMA'SVIEW THE DANGER OF THE NEW ACT LIES IN THE DEVOLUTION OF RESPONSIBILITY FORTHE PUBLIC SERVICES, INCLUDING PUBLIC LIBRARIES, FROM NATIONAL TO LOCALGOVERNMENT. IN SOME LOCAL AUTHORITIES, HE ADDS, TOWN FESTIVALS MAY RECEIVEGREATER PRIORITY THAN THE LIBRARY SERVICE. THE NBLC MUST CONVINCE THEGOVERNMENT OF THE NEED FOR AN INFORMATION ACT WHICH INCLUDES THE PUBLICLIBRARY SERVICE. (FOR AN ABSTRACT OF PART 1|, 2|SEE1| 82|/5007|).
5696|LIBRARY-INFORMATION SERVICE EVALUATION' A CASE-HISTORY FROM PHARMACEUTICAL RAND D.DESCRIBES A 19|-WEEK PROJECT TO EXAMINE AND EVALUATE THE LIBRARY-INFORMATIONSERVICE AT SYNTEX RESEARCH CENTRE, RICCARTON, EDINBURGH, A PHARMACEUTICAL RAND D CENTRE. AREAS LOOKED AT WERE' STOCK-USE RECORDS; INTERLOAN REQUESTS; USEOF LIBRARY STAFF TIME AND THE CURRENT AWARENESS BULLETIN. 36| LIBRARY USERS,RESEARCH SCIENTISTS, WERE INTERVIEWED, AND THEIR DEMAND FOR INFORMATIONSERVICES IS DESCRIBED.

5699|DISCUSSION AND COMMUNICATION FOR STAFF IN THE HOOGEVEEN PUBLIC LIBRARY.IN 1971| A SCHEME OF WORKER PARTICIPATION WAS INTRODUCED AT HOOGEVEEN PUBLICLIBRARY IN THE NETHERLANDS. PREVIOUSLY STAFF MEETINGS WERE RESTRICTED TOADMINISTRATIVE STAFF ONLY. UNDER THE NEW SYSTEM WEEKLY MEETINGS WERE HELD ATWHICH THE CHIEF LIBRARIAN AND HEADS OF THE ADULT AND CHILDREN'S DEPARTMENTSWERE PRESENT. REPORTS OF THESE MEETINGS WERE CIRCULATED TO ALL HEADS OFDEPARTMENTS. IN 1975| FOLLOWING THE OPENING OF A NEW CENTRAL LIBRARY THELIBRARY SERVICE WAS REORGANISED INTO 8| DEPARTMENTS AND A NEW STRUCTURE OFSTAFF MEETINGS WAS INTRODUCED. IN ADDITION TO THE MEETINGS ATTENDED BYADMINISTRATIVE STAFF AND HEADS OF DEPARTMENTS, ALL STAFF OF THE INTERNALSERVICES MEET EVERY 3| WEEKS, WHILE STAFF OF THE EXTERNAL SERVICES MEET EACHWEEK. THE PURPOSE OF THESE MEETINGS IS TO IMPROVE STAFF MOTIVATION AND THEREBYTHE QUALITY OF THE LIBRARY'S SERVICES.
5700|CENTRALISATION AND DECENTRALISATION' ONE POINT OF VIEW.EXAMINES THE DEBATE ON CENTRALISATION AND DECENTRALISATION IN RELATION TO' THEHISTORICAL ASPECTS, SHOWING HOW IN GENERAL THE LATIN AMERICAN UNIVERSITYSYSTEM AT PRESENT DEVELOPED FROM THE ORIGINAL EUROPEAN PATTERN; THEINSTITUTIONAL ASPECTS, WHERE THE NECESSITY FOR UNIVERSITIES TO FULFIL THEIRRESPONSIBILITIES DICTATES ADMINISTRATIVE STRUCTURES, IN TURN GOVERNING LIBRARYORGANISATION; THE TECHNICAL-ADMINISTRATIVE ASPECTS, OUTLINING THE ESSENTIALCHARACTERISTICS OF CENTRALISED, PARTIALLY DECENTRALISED, AND DECENTRALISEDSYSTEMS; AND GEOGRAPHICAL FACTORS. THIS SURVEY LEADS TO THE CONCLUSION THATTHE PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES OF EACH PARTICULAR CASE SHOULD DETERMINEADMINISTRATIVE AND ORGANISATIONAL STRUCTURES.
5701|THE METHODOLOGICAL CENTRE FOR THE RESEARCH LIBRARIES AND INFORMATION ANDDOCUMENTATION SERVICES OF THE MINISTRY FOR UNIVERSITY AND TECHNICAL COLLEGEAFFAIRS.THE CENTRE ASSISTS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF CENTRAL SUBJECT LIBRARIES AND SUBJECTNETWORKS AND PROMOTES THE USE OF ELECTRONIC DATA PROCESSING IN LIBRARIES ANDINFORMATION CENTRES IN EAST GERMANY.

AMONG THE PROBLEMS TACKLED ARE NOT ONLY CATALOGUING, BIBLIOGRAPHY ANDPRESERVATION OF BOOK COLLECTIONS, BUT ALSO STANDARDISATION, RESEARCH ANDSTATISTICS IN LIBRARIES, AS WELL AS CONTINUING EDUCATION OF LIBRARIANS.SPECIAL COMMITTEES ATTEND TO THE RUNNING OF PUBLIC AND SCHOOL LIBRARIES, ANDALSO TO LIBRARIES IN HIGHER EDUCATION. THE ENTIRE NETWORK IS HEADED BY THESLOVAK LIBRARY COUNCIL ESTABLISHED IN THE 1950|S. THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF THECOUNCIL'S ANNUAL PLANS IS TO MEET THE TARGETS SET BY THE SLOVAK MINISTRY OFCULTURE. FOLLOWING A CAREFUL AND THOROUGH EXAMINATION IN THE COURSE OF THECURRENT 5| YEAR PLAN (1981|-85|), MEASURES WILL BE TAKEN TO ENSURE UNIFICATION OFALL ADVISORY ACTIVITIES AND TO INCREASE THEIR IMPACT ON LIBRARIES.
5703|CHILDREN'S LIBRARY WORK AMONG ADULTS.CONTRIBUTION TO AN ISSUE DEVOTED TO PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVICES IN SWEDEN. ACOUNTRY WITH A RICH PUBLICATION OF CHILDREN'S LITERATURE SHOULD ALSO HAVEWELL-APPOINTED AND FLOURISHING CHILDREN'S LIBRARIES. CHILDREN'S LIBRARIES HAVEEXISTED IN SWEDEN FOR 70| YEARS, BUT NOT UNTIL THE 1970|S, WITH GREATEDUCATIONAL REFORMS, WAS PRIORITY ACCORDED TO LIBRARY ACTIVITIES FOR CHILDREN.FROM THE LATE 1970|S, LIBRARY CONSULTANTS' POSTS HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED ATALMOST ALL THE COUNTY LIBRARIES.

5706|ALL LIBRARY SERVICE SHOULD BE FREE OF CHARGE.IN THE BILL FOR A NEW DANISH LIBRARY ACT, WHICH WILL SHORTLY BE TABLED IN THEFOLKETING, THE CLAUSE REGARDING A FREE LIBRARY SERVICE WILL, IT SEEMS, BERETAINED. QUESTIONS WHETHER THE PARTIES WHO BELIEVE THAT A CHARGE SHOULD BELEVIED FOR LIBRARY USE WILL MANAGE TO INFLUENCE THE FINAL FORM OF THE ACT. IFTHE PRINCIPLE OF A FREE SERVICE GOES BY THE BOARD, EVERY IDEA OF AN EQUALSERVICE TO ALL WILL GO BY THE BOARD WITH IT, WITH THE CONSEQUENT BAD EFFECT ONPUBLISHING HOUSES, BOOKSHOPS AND AUTHORS.
5707|FAIR PLAY WITH THE CAKE, YOU KNOW?'.DISCUSSES THE ECONOMIC CUTS AS THEY AFFECT THE LIBRARY SERVICES. THEGOVERNMENT'S SAVINGS CIRCULAR RECOMMENDED THAT LOCAL AUTHORITIES CUT LIBRARYEXPENDITURE TO 185| KR PER CAPITA, AS, IT WAS ARGUED, PUBLIC LIBRARIES SHOWEDSIGNS OF UNCONTROLLED GROWTH. THE LIBRARIANS' UNION HAS, HOWEVER, CALCULATEDPUBLIC LIBRARIES' REAL GROWTH IN 1980| AS WITHIN THE GOVERNMENT'S RECOMMENDED3|%; THIS IS SUPPORTED BY THE LIBRARY INSPECTORATE. THE FIGURES FOR 1981|INDICATE AN AVERAGE FALL IN REAL GROWTH OF 1|.4|%. THE LIBRARIANS' UNION HASEXAMINED THE LOCAL EFFECTS OF CUTS AND FOUND THAT FRINGE SERVICES LIKEOUTREACH ACTIVITIES ARE WORST HIT AND THAT STAFF APPOINTMENTS ARE FROZEN. THEGOVERNMENT'S TECHNOCRATS HAVE DRAWN UP MODELS FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF THEPUBLIC SECTOR, BUT LIBRARIANS' ANSWER MUST BE THAT THE DEVELOPMENT OF THELIBRARY PART OF THIS SECTOR IS NOT A TECHNICAL MATTER ONLY, BUT THAT CULTURALASPECTS ARE EQUALLY IMPORTANT.
5708|GANGS OF SAVERS IN A DANCE OF CRANES.4| MEMBERS OF THE LIBRARIANS' UNION'S WORKING PARTY ON SAVINGS WERE ASKED TOEVALUATE THE LIBRARY SITUATION IN VIEW OF THE CUTS IN EXPENDITURE. THEYDISCUSSED THE FIGURES RELATING TO RUNNING COSTS, STAFF AND MATERIAL COSTSPRODUCED BY THE LIBRARY INSPECTORATE AND THE EFFECTS OF CUTS ON WORK LOADS ANDLOANS. VIEWS DIFFERED AS TO WHETHER MINIMUM NORMS SHOULD BE LAID DOWN. THEYAGREED THAT THE UNION AS A CENTRAL ORGANISATION COULD DO LITTLE TO GIVEGUIDELINES FOR ACTION IN LOCAL SITUATIONS. SOME THOUGHT MEMBERS SHOULD REFUSETO TAKE PART IN LOCAL WORKING GROUPS ON SAVINGS SET UP TO GIVE PRIORITIES TOCUTS IN DIFFERENT AREAS, AS THIS WAS TANTAMOUNT TO CONDONING CUTS, OTHERSTHOUGHT USEFUL INFORMATION COULD BE GAINED FROM PARTICIPATION AND THAT LOCALLIBRARIANS SHOULD PRESENT POLITICANS WITH WELL ARGUED BUDGET PROPOSALS ANDOUTLINE EFFECTS OF PARTICULAR CUTS.
5709|CABLE LIBRARY SURVEY RESULTS.PUBLIC SERVICE SATELLITE CONSORTIUM CONDUCTED A SURVEY OF ACADEMIC LIBRARIES,IN 1980|, TO STUDY THEIR DATA COMMUNICATIONS NEEDS AND SERVICES. 'CABLELIBRARIES' (CATVLIB) WERE IDENTIFIED AS LIBRARIES CONNECTED TO LOCAL CABLECOMPANIES. A 2|ND STUDY AIMED TO DETERMINE TO WHAT EXTENT A NATIONAL SATELLITECABLE LIBRARY NETWORK MIGHT ALREADY BE IN TECHNICAL EXISTENCE; HOW MANYLIBRARIES ARE PRESENTLY CONNECTED TO COOPERATIVE CABLE COMPANIES WITHSATELLITE HARDWARE AND EXCESS SATELLITE RECEIVER CAPACITY AND OF THAT NUMBER,HOW MANY CABLE LIBRARIES WOULD BE INTERESTED IN PARTICIPATING INSATELLITE-ASSISTED LIBRARY SERVICES AND TELECONFERENCING.

5711|AUTOMATION: A CHALLENGE TO THE SOCIAL FUNCTION OF THE LIBRARY AND THE SOCIALCHARACTER OF THE STAFF?.DISCUSSES THE IDEAS OF COBABUS AND THIEM ON THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEENAUTOMATION AND' (1|) PRODUCTIVITY; (2|) PRODUCT QUALITY; (3|) STAFFQUALIFICATIONS AND TRAINING, AND THE EFFECTS OF GOVERNMENTAL RESTRICTIONS ONEXPENDITURE UPON THESE RELATIONSHIPS. AUTOMATION IN LIBRARIES TENDS TO LAGBEHIND AUTOMATION IN OTHER FIELDS BUT IT DEMANDS CHANGES IN STAFF TRAINING,INTELLECTUALISATION OF PRODUCTION WORK AND A NEW RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PUBLICAND ACADEMIC LIBRARIES. PROCESSES PREVIOUSLY SEPARATED CAN BE INTEGRATED BYAUTOMATION. BEFORE AUTOMATION THERE WAS A TENDENCY TOWARDS RIGIDITY IN THEHIGHER STAFF GRADES; NOW AUTOMATION REQUIRES CHANGES IN THE STAFF HIERARCHYAND THE OLD IDEA OF THE 'CLASSICAL LIBRARIAN'.
5712|THE REITERATE ON THE AUTOMATION OF LIBRARIES IN CZECHOSLOVAKIA, THIS TIMEINCLUDING SOME PRACTICAL RESULTS.AN ANALYSIS AND EVALUATION OF THE DEVELOPMENT AND CURRENT SITUATION IN LIBRARYAUTOMATION IN CZECHOSLOVAKIA ARE PRESENTED, INCLUDING A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OFMAJOR TRENDS.

OPPONENTS OFAUTOMATION POINT TO THE SOCIAL IMPLICATIONS OF THE REPLACEMENT OF MAN BYMACHINES. A FURTHER GROUP SUGGESTS THAT THE USE OF AUTOMATION IN LIBRARIESDEPENDS ON THE NATURE OF THE WORK TO BE DONE AND ASSERTS THAT CERTAINTECHNICAL AIDS, SUCH AS THE TELEPHONE AND THE PHOTOCOPIER, ARE REGARDED ASESSENTIAL TO A LIBRARY'S SERVICES. IN SPITE OF UNEMPLOYMENT IT IS BECOMINGINCREASINGLY DIFFICULT TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN STAFF FOR CERTAIN TASKS INLIBRARIES. IN SUCH CASES AUTOMATION CAN BE OF GREAT ASSISTANCE.
5714|STATE PUBLIC SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL LIBRARY OF THE USSR. AUTOMATION OFLIBRARY PROCEDURE AS A MEANS OF RAISING EFFICIENCY OF LIBRARIES.PAPER PRESENTED AT THE CONFERENCE OF COOPERATIVE LIBRARIANS & DOCUMENTATIONOFFICERS, MOSCOW, OCT 80|. SINCE 1976| AN AUTOMATED SYSTEM HAS BEEN UNDERDEVELOPMENT IN THE STATE PUBLIC SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL LIBRARY OF THE USSR,COVERING ALL BASIC LIBRARY PROCEDURES, FROM ACQUISITIONS TO SUBSCRIBERSERVICES. IT IS ALSO PLANNED TO AUTOMATE THE MAINTENANCE OF A CARD INDEX OFREADERS, AND CARD INDEXES OF PARTICULAR REFERENCE SOLUTIONS. IT IS FELT THATTHE AUTOMATION WILL SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASE THE LIBRARY'S EFFICIENCY.

GIVES A SHORT HISTORICAL REVIEW OF FORMAL QUALIFICATIONSREQUIRED OF APPLICANTS TO QUALIFIED LIBRARIANS' POSTS IN SWEDISH ACADEMICLIBRARIES. SHOWS HOW NEW DEVELOPMENTS IN EDUCATION AND RESEARCH AS WELL AS INLIBRARY TECHNIQUES HAVE AFFECTED CONDITIONS OF WORK IN A LIBRARY. NEW TASKSHAVE BEEN ADDED TO THE TRADITIONAL ONES, AND IT IS NECESSARY TO FIND WAYS OFRECONCILING THE NEW DEVELOPMENT WITH EXISTING LIBRARY EXPERTISE, AND TO FIND ACOMMON DOMINATOR WHICH WILL WORK TOWARDS AN INTEGRATION OF ALL TASKS IN ALIBRARY. THIS IS FOUND IN THE OVERALL AIMS FOR LIBRARY WORK' TO MEET THE NEEDSOF THE CUSTOMER. INSTRUCTION AND TRAINING ON HOW BEST TO MEET THE USERS' NEEDSSHOULD THEREFORE FORM AN IMPORTANT PART OF ALL EDUCATION FOR LIBRARIANSHIP.
5722|STAFFING IN NIGERIAN UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES.DESCRIBES A STUDY UNDERTAKEN TO ASCERTAIN TO WHAT EXTENT ACADEMIC LIBRARIANSIN NIGERIA SATISFY THE BIBLIOGRAPHICAL AND INFORMATION REQUIREMENTS OFSCHOLARSHIP AND RESEARCH, AND WHETHER THE INSTITUTIONAL SETTINGS IN WHICHSTAFF WORK ARE CONDUCIVE TO EFFECTIVE PROFESSIONAL SERVICE. AMONG MAJORELEMENTS EXAMINED WERE THE LIBRARIANS' PERCEPTIONS OF THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES;THEIR ACADEMIC AND PROFESSIONAL BACKGROUNDS; WORK ENVIRONMENTS; JOBSATISFACTION AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR CONTINUING EDUCATION AND PROFESSIONALDEVELOPMENT. IT WAS FOUND THAT PROFESSIONAL LIBRARY SERVICE HAS BEEN HINDEREDBY THE INABILITY OF THE LIBRARY ADMINISTRATORS TO CONCEPTUALISE THE PROPERROLE OF A LIBRARIAN; RIGID BUREAUCRATISATION IN THE LIBRARIES; FAILURE TOSEPARATE PROFESSIONAL FROM NON-PROFESSIONAL DUTIES; AND BY LIMITED INCENTIVESAND OPPORTUNITIES FOR CONTINUING EDUCATION AND PROFESSIONAL GROWTH.
5723|TRAINING JUNIOR STAFF IN A MAJOR RESEARCH LIBRARY FOR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY.CONTRIBUTION TO AN ISSUE ON EDUCATION FOR TECHNOLOGICAL UNIVERSITY LIBRARYWORK.

DISCUSSES HOW LIBRARY MANAGERS CAN TRY TOENSURE THAT THEIR ABILITY TO MANAGE THE LIBRARY REMAINS AS UNIMPAIRED ASPOSSIBLE AFTER UNIONISATION. ARGUES THAT THE SERVICE FUNCTION IS THE ASPECT OFLIBRARY OPERATIONS MOST ENDANGERED BY THE IMPACT OF UNIONS, AND URGES THOSERESPONSIBLE TO ENSURE THAT THE SERVICE GOAL OF LIBRARIES REMAINS AS UNFETTEREDAS POSSIBLE BY A COLLECTIVE AGREEMENT.
5728|THE CURRENT STATE OF LIBRARIANSHIP TRAINING FOR ASSISTANT LIBRARIANS.IN RECENT YEARS TRAINING FOR THE HIGHER STAFF GRADES HAS UNDERGONE AFUNDAMENTAL REFORM. THE NUMBER OF LIBRARY SCHOOL GRADUATES WORKING IN ACADEMICLIBRARIES HAS NOW INCREASED. FORMERLY, ALTHOUGH ALL STAFF IN ACADEMICLIBRARIES POSSESSED UNIVERSITY DEGREES, FEW OF THEM POSSESSED QUALIFICATIONSIN LIBRARIANSHIP. IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES, BY CONTRAST, MOST SENIOR STAFF HAVELIBRARIANSHIP QUALIFICATIONS. THE NEW SITUATION HAS BEEN CAUSED BY LEGALCHANGES, THE FINAL RESULTS OF WHICH CANNOT BE PREDICTED WITH CERTAINTY. ATPRESENT THERE IS A WIDE VARIETY OF COURSES AVAILABLE; THE BEST BALANCE OFTHEORETICAL AND PRACTICAL TRAINING MUST BE CHOSEN. FURTHER CONSIDERATION MUSTBE GIVEN TO THE JOINT TRAINING OF LIBRARIANS AND DOCUMENTALISTS AND TO THESALARIES OF LIBRARY SCHOOL STAFF.

IN A COLLECTIVE PURCHASING DECISION EACH PARTICIPANT CAN USE THEKEY TO MAKE DECISIONS FOR THE WHOLE NETWORK; THUS INDIVIDUAL RESPONSIBILITYFOR LITERATURE PROVISION BECOMES GREATER. USING A KEY ALSO ENSURES BALANCEDSTOCK PROPORTIONS THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE NETWORK AND TAKES INTO ACCOUNT DEMANDSFOR TIME SAVING AND FOR IMPROVED STOCK QUALITY, THUS OFFERING AN OPTIMALSOLUTION FOR UNIFYING STOCKS IN A TERRITORIAL NETWORK.
5842|PURCHASING KEYS' METHODS OF CARRYING OUT IDEAS ON STOCK-BUILDING.MUCH ATTENTION IS BEING PAID AT PRESENT TO STOCK-BUILDING PROBLEMS, INCLUDINGTHE DISTRIBUTION OF MATERIAL WITHIN A PUBLIC LIBRARY NETWORK. WORKING OUTSTOCK-BUILDING PRINCIPLES CAN BE TIME-CONSUMING AND THIS IS ONLY ONE ASPECT OFSTOCK-BUILDING, EVEN IF IT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT. A PURCHASING KEY IS A CODINGSYSTEM FOR THE PRACTICAL APPLICATION OF THESE PRINCIPLES; EXPERIENCES INMAGDEBURG HAVE PROVED THE KEY TO BE A USEFUL RATIONALISATION METHOD. THROUGHTHE CODING SYMBOLS THE LIBRARIAN CAN SEE QUICKLY WHAT TYPES OF LITERATURE AREIN WHICH LIBRARIES IN THE NETWORK. THE SYMBOLS ARE FLEXIBLE AND CAN EASILY BEKEPT UP TO DATE. OTHER STOCK-BUILDING CRITERIA ARE LITERARY MERIT, SPECIALISTDEMAND, FUNCTIONS OF INDIVIDUAL LIBRARIES IN THE NETWORK, NUMBERS OF READERS,SPACE AND MONEY.

5857|THE DEUTSCHE STAATSBIBLIOTHEK AS A CENTRE FOR INTER-LIBRARY LOANS AND UNIONCATALOGUING.IN THE 1970|S THE LIBRARY FOUNDED A SPECIAL INSTITUTE TO COPE WITHINTER-LIBRARY LOANS AND UNION CATALOGUING. THE INSTITUTE'S WORK HAS INCLUDEDACCELERATING ORDERING PROCEDURES, ORGANISING COPYRIGHT DEPOSIT ANDINTERNATIONAL INTER-LOAN SCHEMES, IMPROVING STAFF QUALIFICATIONS, SOLVINGLEGAL PROBLEMS CONNECTED WITH THE USE OF ELECTRONIC DATA PROCESSING, KEEPINGCATALOGUES UP TO DATE AND DEVELOPING A COURIER SERVICE. SINCE 1978| STATISTICSHAVE BEEN COMPILED ON THE 400| LIBRARIES INVOLVED IN TELETEXT SERVICES.

THE INSTITUTE PLAYS AN ACTIVE PARTIN INTER-LIBRARY COOPERATION BETWEEN THE COMMUNIST COUNTRIES.
5858|TRANSPORT SCHEMES FOR INTERLIBRARY LENDING' THE UK EXPERIENCE.WHERE POSTAL SERVICES ARE SLOW, UNRELIABLE OR EXPENSIVE, DEDICATED TRANSPORTSCHEMES FOR INTERLENDING PURPOSES SHOULD BE CONSIDERED; THEIR USEFULNESS WILLVARY FROM 1| COUNTRY TO ANOTHER, ACCORDING TO LOCAL CIRCUMSTANCES. IN THE UK,FEASIBILITY STUDIES WERE FOLLOWED BY THE SETTING UP OF TRANSPORT SCHEMES IN ANUMBER OF THE UK LIBRARY REGIONS, AND A NATIONAL SCHEME LINKING THE REGIONSWAS ENVISAGED. TRANSPORT SCHEMES WERE NOT CONSIDERED WORTHWHILE IN THE LARGERREGIONS WITH LESS INTERLENDING ACTIVITY. A METHODOLOGY FOR SETTING UP SCHEMESHAS BEEN DEVISED. THE PRESENT TRANSPORT SCHEMES ARE FINANCIALLY COMPETITIVEAND LIKELY TO REMAIN SO. UK EXPERIENCE MIGHT PROVIDE A FRAMEWORK FOR ASSESSINGPOTENTIAL SCHEMES IN OTHER COUNTRIES.
5859|ON CHARGING FOR INFORMATION SERVICES.COMMENTS ON A REPORT BY THE DELEGATION FOR SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICALINFORMATION PROVISION' 2|INFORMATION AT ANY PRICE' ON CHARGING FOR INFORMATIONSERVICES1|, IN WHICH IT IS SUGGESTED THAT INTERLENDING FROM SCIENTIFICLIBRARIES SHOULD BE CHARGED AT A STANDARD RATE PER LOAN, DESPITE THE FACT THATCHARGING FOR TRADITIONAL LIBRARY SERVICES WAS EXCLUDED FROM THE COMMISSION'SREMIT. 1| REASON FOR CONSIDERING CHARGES NONETHELESS IS THE INCREASING SCOPEAND COST OF INTERLENDING. ANOTHER IS THE CHANGE IN THE BUDGETING OFINSTITUTIONS FOR TERTIARY EDUCATION WHICH HAS TRANSFERRED LIBRARY ALLOCATIONSFROM THE STATE TO THE INSTITUTIONS; THESE ARE TEMPTED TO ACHIEVE SAVINGSTHROUGH CHARGES ON INTERLENDING. THE REPORT REGARDS INTERLENDING OF LITTLEIMPORTANCE TO PUBLIC LIBRARIES. IT DOES NOT ATTEMPT TO CALCULATE THE COST OFINTERLENDING, NOR THE COST OF ADMINISTERING A SYSTEM OF CHARGES.
5860|INTERLIBRARY LENDING IN THE NETHERLANDS.INTERLENDING IN THE NETHERLANDS IS BASED ON A NATIONAL SYSTEM FOR THE SUPPLYOF SCHOLARLY LITERATURE AND A REGIONAL SYSTEM FOR SUPPLYING A WIDER RANGE OFMATERIAL MAINLY BETWEEN PUBLIC LIBRARIES. 725|,000| REQUESTS WERE MADE IN 1979|.MOST REQUESTS ARE SATISFIED THROUGH UNION CATALOGUES OR PRINTED UNION LISTS.IN ADDITION TO THE 12| PROVINCIAL CENTRES, THE 13| REGIONAL SUPPORT LIBRARIESHAVE A CENTRAL ROLE IN THE REGIONAL SUPPLY SYSTEM; THEY RECEIVED 131|,708|REQUESTS IN 1980| AND SATISFIED 27|%. A SINGLE CENTRE IN EACH REGION ISRECOMMENDED. A SURVEY OF THE NATIONAL SYSTEM SHOWED THAT 40|% OF ALL REQUESTSAT THIS LEVEL CAME FROM ACADEMIC LIBRARIES, 40|% FROM SPECIAL LIBRARIES AND 20|%FROM PUBLIC LIBRARIES. MOST REQUESTS ARE FOR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY (60|%), FORENGLISH LANGUAGE MATERIAL (55|% OF ALL REQUESTS; 70|% OF REQUESTS FOR JOURNALS),AND FOR MORE RECENT MATERIAL (65|% PUBLISHED IN THE LAST 10| YEARS). THESATISFACTION RATE WAS 76|% (HIGHER FOR REQ UESTS SENT TO UNION CATALOGUES): 1|/2|WERE SUPPLIED IN 2| WEEKS, 2|/3| IN 3| WEEKS IMPORTANT GAPS IN JOURNAL COVERAGEWERE IDENTIFIED. AN ON-LINE NATIONAL UNION CATALOGUE WILL BE AVAILABLE IN 1984|AND WILL BE USED TO DISTRIBUTE REQUESTS MORE EVENLY BETWEEN LIBRARIES, BUTSPECIFIC GRANTS TO SUPPORT THE INTERLENDING FUNCTION IN MAJOR SUPPLYINGLIBRARIES WILL STILL BE NECESSARY, AND CHARGES SHOULD BE MADE. IMPROVED UNIONCATALOGUES ARE ENVISAGED AT THE REGIONAL LEVEL ALSO.
5861|A PROPOSAL FOR PLANNING AN INTERLENDING SYSTEM FOR THE LIBRARIES OF CAIROCITY, EGYPT.(PHD DISSERTATION-PITTSBURGH UNIVERSITY). A QUESTIONNAIRE SURVEY, INTERVIEWS,VISITS, AND A LITERATURE ANALYSIS WERE USED TO EXPOSE THE FACTORS RESPONSIBLEFOR THE PRESENT STATE OF INTERLIBRARY LOAN IN CAIRO. A SYSTEM FOR FORMALINTERLIBRARY LENDING WHICH CAN BE MODIFIED FOR OTHER DEVELOPING COUNTRIES ISPROPOSED.
5862|PLANNING INTERLENDING SYSTEMS IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES.BASED ON REPORTS DESCRIBING THE EXTENT AND DEVELOPMENT OF INTERLIBRARY LOANSYSTEMS IN SEVERAL OF THE DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, A COMPOSITE IS DRAWN OF THEDIFFICULTIES AND PROBLEMS WHICH ARISE IN THE PLANNING STAGES AND EXECUTION OFSUCH SYSTEMS IN THESE COUNTRIES. FINANCIAL PROBLEMS, AS WELL AS PROBLEMS OFLIBRARY POLICY, AND THE REALISTIC POSSIBILITIES CONNECTED WITH THE LITERATURESUPPLY AND CORRESPONDING NEED FOR AN INTERLIBRARY LOAN PROGRAMME IN THESECOUNTRIES ARE POINTED OUT. ATTENTION IS ALSO GIVEN TO THE RELATIONSHIP OF THELOCAL LIBRARIES TO THE NATIONAL LIBRARY. CONSIDERATIONS WHICH SHOULD BE MADEIN FINDING REALISTIC SOLUTIONS TO THESE PROBLEMS ON A LONG-TERM BASIS CONCLUDETHE REPORT.
5863|CORE COLLECTIONS OF JOURNALS FOR NATIONAL INTERLENDING PURPOSES.CENTRALISED NATIONAL PROVISION FOR INTERLENDING PROVIDES A BETTER SERVICE THANDECENTRALISED PROVISION BUT CAN BE DIFFICULT AND EXPENSIVE TO IMPLEMENT, SOPARTIAL CENTRALISATION SHOULD BE CONSIDERED. JOURNALS ARE SPECIALLY SUITED TOCENTRAL COLLECTIONS. CONCENTRATION OF DEMAND ON A RELATIVELY SMALL NUMBER OFJOURNALS MEANS THAT COLLECTIONS OF 7|,000|-8|,000| TITLES COULD SUPPLY 80|% OFDEMAND AND 2|,000| TITLES 50|% IN MANY COUNTRIES. THERE ARE HOWEVER PROBLEMS INIDENTIFYING JOURNALS FOR CORE COLLECTIONS. BIBLIOMETRIC METHODS CAN BE SHOWNTO BE OF LITTLE HELP. ANALYSIS OF DEMAND AT THE BRITISH LIBRARY LENDINGDIVISION INDICATES THAT RANK LISTS ARE NOT VERY STABLE OVER TIME; AND VARIOUSFACTORS SUCH AS LANGUAGE OR STAGE OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT WILL CAUSEVARIATIONS THAT MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO APPLY CORE LISTS BETWEEN COUNTRIES(THOUGH IT MAY BE POSSIBLE TO ALLOW FOR DIFFERENCES, ESPECIALLY IF CORE LISTSBASED ON CURRENT DEMAND COULD BE OBTAINED FROM A NUMBER OF DIFFERENTCOUNTRIES). ONCE A CORE COLLECTION HAD BEEN SET UP, IT WOULD HAVE TO ATTRACTSUFFICIENT REQUESTS TO MONITOR DEMAND AND ADJUST ITS CONTENTS ACCORDINGLY. IFA COMPREHENSIVE COLLECTION IS NOT POSSIBLE, LIMITATION TO CERTAIN SUBJECTS HASADVANTAGES. AS COLLECTIONS GROW, ADDITIONAL JOURNALS WILL BE CHEAPER TOACQUIRE, THOUGH THE UNIT COST PER REQUEST WILL STILL BE LOWER FOR THE JOURNALSIN HEAVIEST DEMAND. CONCLUDES THAT THE CONCEPT OF CORE COLLECTIONS IS SOUND,BUT FURTHER DATA ARE NEEDED BEFORE THE PRACTICAL PROBLEMS OF SETTING UP SUCHCOLLECTIONS CAN BE PROPERLY ASSESSED.

THE NARROW CATCHWORD USESPRECISE TERMINOLOGY AND SEPARATES RELATED MATERIAL; THE BROAD CATCHWORD COVERSWIDE SUBJECT AREAS AND TENDS TO RESULT IN THE FORMATION OF HIERARCHIES OFSUBORDINATED GROUPS. DIE DEUTSCHE BIBLIOTHEK (GERMAN NATIONAL LIBRARY) USESMAINLY NARROW CATCHWORDS, EQUATING THIS WITH PRECISE SUBJECT CLASSIFICATIONBUT OCCASIONALLY DEVIATIONS FROM THIS PRINCIPLE OCCUR. CATCHWORDS IN SOMESUBJECT AREAS ARE NARROWER THAN IN OTHERS. TERMINOLOGY IS CAREFULLY CONTROLLEDAND THIS IS ESSENTIAL WHEN PRECISE TERMS ARE USED.
