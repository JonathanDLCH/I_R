THESE NETWORKS SHOULD NOT BE CONSTRUCTED IN ALL 11|FEDERAL STATES BUT SHOULD BE BUILT UP ON THE EXISTING 7| LENDING SYSTEMREGIONS; THEY WOULD ALL BE CONNECTED IN A NATIONAL NETWORK. REGIONAL LIBRARYCENTRES WOULD FORM THE NATIONAL NETWORK AND WOULD HAVE THE FOLLOWING GENERALTASK AREAS' CATALOGUING AND ACQUISITION, CENTRAL EDITING OF CATALOGUES ETC.,DATA EXCHANGE WITH OTHER CENTRAL INSTITUTES AND NETWORKS, SUPPLYING ORDEREDBOO KS WITHIN THE PLANNED NATIONAL ORDER SYSTEM, DEVELOPING SYSTEMS ANDPROGRAMMES FOR THE SOFTWARE OF THE REGIONAL NETWORK, AND PLANNING ANDCOORDINATION.
2168|DO LIBRARIES HAVE POLITICAL DUTIES?.     MANY TASKS UNDERTAKEN BY PUBLIC LIBRARIES ARE POLITICAL, NOT BECAUSE THEYPROMOTE PARTY POLITICS BUT BECAUSE THEY PROVIDE ENLIGHTENMENT AND PLEASURE FOREACH INDIVIDUAL IN A FREE DEMOCRACY. CULTURE INVOLVES NOT ONLY BEAUTY BUT ALSOSOCIAL REALITY. LIBRARIANS MUST HELP ALL HANDICAPPED PEOPLE; GERMANY IS AHEADOF FRANCE IN LIBRARY WORK WITH THE PHYSICALLY HANDICAPPED AND PROVISION OFLIBRARY FACILITIES FOR FOREIGN WORKERS CERTAINLY INVOLVES BOTH CULTURE ANDPOLITICS. THE LIBRARIES MUST PROMOTE READING, OR BOOKS MAY BE OUSTED BYAUDIO-VISUAL MEDIA. STOCK SELECTION CRITERIA MUST BE THOSE OF TRUTH ANDOBJECTIVITY; THE LIBRARIAN MUST BE MINDFUL OF ALL VIEWPOINTS, SINCE FREEDOMPERMITS OPPOSITION.
2169|PUBLIC RELATIONS IN UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES.     CHALLENGES THE POPULARLY HELD BELIEF THAT THE UNIVERSITY LIBRARY HAS A CAPTIVEAUDIENCE, AND THEREFORE REQUIRES LITTLE OR NO PUBLIC RELATIONS PROGRAMME.ARGUES THAT THE USE OF THE ACADEMIC LIBRARY BY STAFF AND STUDENTS MUST NOT BETAKEN FOR GRANTED, AND THAT DETAILED GUIDANCE IN THE USE OF THE LIBRARY SHOULDBE GIVEN TO POSTGRADUATES AND UNDERGRADUATES. OFFERS SOME ADVICE ON THEIMPLEMENTATION OF A SUCCESSFUL PUBLIC RELATIONS PROGRAMME, AND SUGGESTS THEDESIGNATION OF A LIBRARIAN AS A PUBLIC RELATIONS OFFICER.
2170|SELLING THE BUSINESS LIBRARY.     IN TODAY'S COST-CONSCIOUS ECONOMY, IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT THE SPECIAL LIBRARYHAS A WELL-DEFINED PUBLIC RELATIONS PROGRAMME. PUBLIC RELATIONS ACTIVITIES ANDPROBLEMS OF THE SPECIAL LIBRARY IN A BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT ARE CONSIDERED. THEAUDIENCES SERVED ARE IDENTIFIED, AND SOME OF THE ACTIVE MEANS BY WHICHBUSINESS LIBRARIES CAN SUCCESSFULLY SELL THEIR SERVICES ARE OUTLINED.
2171|THE NATIONAL PLANNING FOR LIBRARIES, DOCUMENTATION ARCHIVES AND INFORMATIONSERVICES WITH REFERENCE TO GENERAL INFORMATION PROGRAMME FOR BOTSWANA.     (MLS DISSERTATION.) AN ACCOUNT OF THE STRUCTURE OF EXISTING LIBRARY,DOCUMENTATION, AND ARCHIVES SERVICES IN BOTSWANA, BIBLIOGRAPHICAL CONTROLSERVICES, PUBLISHING AND DISTRIBUTION SERVICES, AND THE GENERAL INFORMATIONPROGRAMME AND ITS IMPLICATIONS FOR BOTSWANA. CONCLUDES THAT WHILST THERE HAVEBEEN SOME ACHIEVEMENTS, IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT EXISTING SERVICES BE IMPROVED.THE NATIONAL INFORMATION INFRASTRUCTURE SHOULD BE REASSESSED AND DEVELOPED INORDER TO COPE WITH THE PRESENT SOCIO-ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL DEMANDS. HOPESTHAT THE NECESSARY BOLD STEPS WILL BE TAKEN TO DEVELOP A FULLY INTEGRATED ANDEFFECTIVE NATIONAL INFORMATION SYSTEM.
2172|THE LEGAL POSITION OF POLYTECHNIC ('FACHHOCHSCHUL-') LIBRARIES AFTER THE NEWPOLYTECHNIC (UNIVERSITY) LAWS.     IN 1979| NEW UNIVERSITY LAWS WERE PASSED WHICH AFFECTED POLYTECHNIC('FACHHOCHSCHUL-') LAWS AND THE LEGAL POSITION OF POLYTECHNIC LIBRARIES.ALTHOUGH POLYTECHNICS DIFFER IN FORM SLIGHTLY FROM ONE STATE TO ANOTHER WITHINWEST GERMANY, THERE ARE SOME GENERAL POINTS IN THE NEW LAWS WHICH INFLUENCEPOLYTECHNIC LIBRARIES IN THE SAME WAY. THE STATUS OF THE LIBRARIES HAS BECOMEMORE PRECISE; THEY ARE RECOGNISED AS CENTRAL WORKING UNITS. THE LIBRARIES NOWHAVE THE RIGHT TO MAKE DECISIONS CONCERNING BUDGET EXPENDITURE AND THEALLOCATION OF NEW STAFF. THE POLYTECHNIC LIBRARY HAS THUS BECOME ANINDEPENDENT INSTITUTION WITH ITS OWN DUTIES AND RIGHTS WITHIN THE POLYTECHNIC.HOWEVER, LIBRARIES STILL DEPEND ON THE SIZE OF ALLOCATIONS FROM THE CENTRALPOLYTECHNIC BODIES. FINAL DECISIONS ON THE CHOICE OF LITERATURE ACQUISITIONCAN STILL ONLY BE MADE BY THE RELEVANT POLYTECHNIC DEPARTMENT WITH THE LIBRARY MERELY ACTING IN AN ADVISORY CAPACITY.
2173|HOW CAN LIBRARY EFFECTIVENESS BE MEASURED?.     EXAMINES THE LIBRARY LITERATURE WHICH DEALS WITH MEASUREMENT OF LIBRARYEFFECTIVENESS. THIS IS USUALLY MEASURED IN TERMS OF LOAN FIGURES, BUT THISMETHOD FAILS TO TAKE ACCOUNT OF REFERENCE AND INFORMATION WORK, NOW OF GROWINGIMPORTANCE. EFFECTIVENESS MUST BE SEEN IN RELATION TO THE LIBRARY'S AIMS. AMANUAL FOR PERFORMANCE MEASURES IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES WAS PUBLISHED IN 1976| BYTHE AMERICAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION. FOR THOSE LIBRARIES WHICH ACTIVELY PROMOTEMATERIALS TO CREATE DEMANDS, HAMBURG ET AL (1972|) SUGGEST THE FOLLOWING TESTSFOR EFFECTIVENESS' EXPOSURE COUNTS, ITEM USE-DAYS, EXPOSURE TIME. GORE (1978|)USES THE HOLDINGS RATE, AVAILABILITY RATE, AND PERFORMANCE RATE, THE LATTERMEASURING THE PERCENTAGE OF REQUIRED MATERIAL AVAILABLE WHEN WANTED BY USER.IT HAS BEEN POINTED OUT THAT BECAUSE EFFECTIVENESS IS A COMPOSITE CONCEPT ITSMEASUREMENT IS COMPLEX, BUT THAT RELYING ON LOAN FIGURES ONLY IS NO LONGERNECESSARY.
2174|LIBRARY DATA, STATISTICS AND INFORMATION' PROGRESS TOWARD COMPARABILITY.     LIBRARIES OF ALL KINDS AND SIZES ARE INCREASINGLY BOUND BY COMMON NEEDS ANDCONCERNS. THIS SYMBIOSIS HAS PLACED NEW DEMANDS UPON THE COMMUNITY. PRIMARYAMONG THESE IS THE DEMAND FOR COMMON UNDERSTANDINGS AND A LANGUAGE IN WHICH TOSHARE THESE UNDERSTANDINGS. ONE AVENUE TO SUCH AN OBJECTIVE IS OUTLINED.FOREMOST TO THIS DEVELOPMENT IS A FRAMEWORK OF INFORMATION ABOUT LIBRARIES. AMETHOD BY WHICH TO CATALOGUE THE IMPRESSIONS OF LIBRARY BEHAVIOUR AND FROMWHICH TO MOVE TO SOME EMPIRICALLY BASED AND SOUND THEORY OF LIBRARY BEHAVIOURIS DESCRIBED.

2176|REGIONAL PROBLEMS IN LIBRARIANSHIP' A STATEMENT OF THE SITUATION.     BASIC PROBLEMS IN REGIONAL LIBRARIANSHIP CAN BE IDENTIFIED AND USED ASSUBJECTS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH. THEY INCLUDE' (1|) REGIONAL PECULIARITIESREGARDING THE DISPERSAL AND USAGE OF LIBRARY RESOURCES; (2|) THE NEED FOR MORERATIONAL GEOGRAPHICAL DIVISIONS BETWEEN LIBRARY SYSTEMS; (3|) THE FORMATION OFCOORDINATED PROGRAMMES AND AIMS FOR SUCH GEOGRAPHICALLY-BASED SYSTEMS; (4|) THENEED FOR LEVELLING-UP STANDARDS OF LIBRARY SERVICE WITHIN THE DIFFERENTREGIONS; (5|) THE NEED TO INCREASE MANAGEMENT EFFICIENCY GENERALLY.CONSIDERATION OF THESE PROBLEMS WILL PROVIDE A SOUND BASIS FOR FUTUREDEVELOPMENT.
2177|NOW THAT I'M IN CHARGE, WHAT DO I DO?'' SIX RULES ABOUT RUNNING A SPECIALLIBRARY FOR THE NEW LIBRARY MANAGER.M     UCH ATTENTION IS GIVEN TO THE TECHNICAL SKILLS THAT ARE NEEDED WHEN WORKING INA COMPANY LIBRARY. BUT THE KNOWLEDGE AND ATTITUDES THAT ARE NECESSARY FORMANAGING ONE, ESPECIALLY DURING THE CURRENT INFORMATION AGE, ARE LESSFREQUENTLY EXAMINED. 6| BASIC PRINCIPLES THE LIBRARIAN SHOULD KEEP IN MIND WHENMANAGING A COMPANY LIBRARY ARE DISCUSSED.
2178|SCHOOL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT. IMPLICATIONS FOR SCHOOL LIBRARY SERVICE.     PREPARED FOR SUBMISSION TO THE NEW SOUTH WALES DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION TOASSIST THE DEPARTMENT'S OFFICERS IN THEIR EFFORTS TO DEVELOP A COHESIVESTATEMENT ON THE ROLE, FUNCTION, AND STAFFING OF SCHOOL LIBRARIES. FOCUSES ONPOLICY ISSUES IN THE AREA OF SCHOOL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT IN THE CONTEXT OF 3|TIERS-THE SCHOOL LEVEL, REGIONAL LEVEL, AND CENTRAL SUPPORT SERVICES.
2179|DECISION-MAKING PROCESSES FOR INFORMATION MANAGERS.     HARRISON'S MODEL OF GROUP DECISION MAKING IS DESCRIBED AND DISCUSSED IN TERMSOF ITS IMPLICATIONS FOR THE DECISIONS LIBRARIANS AND OTHER INFORMATIONMANAGERS ARE CALLED UPON TO MAKE. ATTENTION IS GIVEN TO QUESTIONS OF DECISIONQUALITY AND TO FACTORS, SUCH AS GROUP SIZE, REWARD AND PENALTY MECHANISMS, ANDGROUP NORMS, WHICH AFFECT DECISION MAKING WITHIN GROUPS. INFORMATION MANAGERSHAVE SPECIAL RESPONSIBILITIES WHEN IT COMES TO GROUP DECISION MAKING'IMPROVING THEIR OWN GROUP DECISION-MAKING SKILLS AND PROCESSES, REMOVINGBARRIERS TO EFFECTIVE GROUP DECISION MAKING, BROADENING THE INFORMATIONRESOURCE BASE THEY AND THEIR CLIENTS USE IN DECISION MAKING, DESIGNINGINFORMATION SYSTEMS TO FACILITATE DECISION MAKING, AND RAISING THE VISIBILITYOF THE LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SCIENCES AS CONTRIBUTING DISCIPLINES TO THEDECISION SCIENCES.
2180|DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS IN LIBRARIES.     THE USE OF COMPUTERS AND MANAGEMENT SCIENCE/OPERATIONS RESEARCH IN LIBRARIESIS REVIEWED. THE CONCEPT OF A DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEM (DSS) IS INTRODUCED. DSSCAN BE VIEWED AS A SYNTHESIS OF THE USE OF COMPUTERS AND QUANTITATIVE METHODSTO ASSIST LIBRARIANS IN MANAGERIAL DECISION-MAKING SITUATIONS. AN EXAMPLE OF ADSS APPLICATION FOR A MEDIUM-SIZED LIBRARY IS DESCRIBED.
2181|ARE SUBJECT INFORMATION CENTRES THE MODERN INFORMATION SOURCE FOR EVERYONE?.     LECTURE GIVEN IN BONN TO A STUDY GROUP FOR ARCHIVES, LIBRARIES ANDDOCUMENTATION CENTRES (N.D.)THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S INFORMATION ANDDOCUMENTATION PROGRAMME HAS AS ITS FOCAL POINT THE FOUNDATION OF 16|CENTRALISED SUBJECT INFORMATION CENTRES BETWEEN 1974| AND 1977|. THIS INITIALSTAGE IS NOT YET COMPLETED OWING TO LACK OF FUNDS; ONLY 3| CENTRES ARE FULLYOPERATIONAL. THE ADEQUACY OF THESE CENTRES HAS BEEN QUESTIONED, ESPECIALLYBECAUSE OF THE EMPHASIS ON CENTRALISATION AND THE INTRODUCTION OF MARKETECONOMY PRINCIPLES; INFORMATION STORED MIGHT BE SELECTED MAINLY TO SUITINDUSTRY. IT IS NOT YET KNOWN WHETHER LIBRARIES MUST CONTRIBUTE TOWARDS COSTS,WHICH WILL BE EXPENSIVE. TRADE UNIONISTS FEAR THAT THE ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY INTHE CENTRES WILL RESULT IN STAFF STRESS AND THAT CENTRALISATION WILL REDUCEEMPLOYMENT.
2182|IMPROVING THE SYSTEM OF METHODOLOGICAL GUIDANCE.     METHODOLOGICAL GUIDANCE IS AN ESSENTIAL FEATURE OF SOVIET LIBRARIANSHIP. THEINVOLVEMENT OF THE GOVERNMENT IN THE PROVISION OF THIS GUIDANCE CAN BE TRACEDBACK TO THE 1920|S. TODAY IT HAS REACHED A HIGHER LEVEL OF EFFICIENCY IN ACTINGTHROUGH THE CENTRALISED LIBRARY NETWORKS SET UP THROUGHOUT THE USSR. THE WAYSIN WHICH THE LIBRARY SERVING AS THE GUIDANCE CENTRE WITHIN A NETWORK CANINFLUENCE THE WORK OF ITS DEPENDENT LIBRARIES CAN BE CLEARLY DEFINED, ANDILLUSTRATED IN TABULAR FORM, BUT THERE IS STILL A NEED FOR MORE COOPERATIONAND BETTER TRAINING FOR STAFF WORKING IN THESE CENTRES.

AID IS EXAMINED AT 2| LEVELS' THE 1|ST VIEWS THE PARTY INPOWER AT THE INCEPTION OF STATE AID, THE 2|ND NOTES THE PARTY WHEN ASIGNIFICANT INCREASE IS MADE IN AID LEVELS. NEITHER CONDITION PRODUCES ADEFINITIVE RELATIONSHIP TO THE PARTY IN POWER AS DEFINED BY THE STUDY, ANDPROGRESS IN AID SEEMS NEARLY EVENLY DIVIDED BETWEEN THE ASCENDANT PARTIES, ORAT LEAST IN PROPORTION TO THE DOMINANT PARTY ACROSS THE USA AT THE TIME.REPORT NOT AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
2184|SAVE! THAT MEANS AGAIN FEWER BOOKS.     THE LIBRARY INSPECTORATE HAS EXAMINED PUBLIC LIBRARY ACCOUNTS FOR 1981|. THESESHOW AN OVERALL INCREASE WELL WITHIN THE SAVINGS CIRCULAR'S LIMIT OF 2|% REALGROWTH. BECAUSE OF BOOK PRICE RISES, ACQUISITIONS ARE LIKELY TO SHOW ANOVERALL FALL OF 4|%. THE SAVINGS CIRCULAR URGED LIBRARIES TO SPEND NOT MORETHAN 185| KR. PER INHABITANT. IT IS DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE WHAT EFFECT THISSTATEMENT HAS HAD, BUT A CLOSER EXAMINATION SHOWS THAT THE HIGHEST SPENDERS,ALL IN THE COPENHAGEN AREA, HAVE CUT DOWN MOST. IN THE REST OF THE COUNTRYPART-TIME LIBRARIES SHOW LARGER PERCENTAGE INCREASES THAN FULL-TIME LIBRARIES.ONLY THE SOUTHERN JUTLAND REGION SHOW A CONSIDERABLE REAL INCREASE INEXPENDITURE ON MATERIALS. AS STAFF SALARIES ARE SUBJECT TO TOPPING UP IFNECESSARY, THESE DO NOT SUFFER AS MUCH FROM CUTS AS MATERIAL EXPENDITURE, ANDTHE PROSPECT IS ONE OF LIBRARIES WITH OUTDATED AND WORN BOOKS.

2343|A VIEW FROM BANGLADESH.     CONTRIBUTION TO A SECTION DEVOTED TO PLANNING INTERLENDING SYSTEMS FORDEVELOPING COUNTRIES. AN INTERLENDING SYSTEM IS VITAL FOR THE DEVELOPMENT ANDSUPPORT OF LITERACY, EDUCATION AND RESEARCH, AND OF INDUSTRY AND THE ECONOMYGENERALLY. INTERLENDING TAKES PLACE IN BANGLADESH BETWEEN CERTAIN GROUPS OFLIBRARIES BUT PROGRESS IS HAMPERED BY THE LACK OF A STRONG NATIONAL LIBRARY TOGIVE LEADERSHIP IN SHARED ACQUISITION AND INTERLENDING POLICIES. ANOTHERPROBLEM ARISES BECAUSE DIFFERENT TYPES OF LIBRARY COME UNDER DIFFERENTGOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS, WITH NO COORDINATION AGENCY. PROGRESS WILL DEPEND ONSYSTEMATIC COOPERATION BETWEEN LIBRARIES.
2344|A VIEW FROM BRAZIL.     CONTRIBUTION TO A SECTION DEVOTED TO PLANNING INTERLENDING SYSTEMS FORDEVELOPING COUNTRIES. FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE LIBRARY PLANNING IN BRAZILINCLUDE ITS LARGE SIZE, ITS VERY YOUNG POPULATION, ITS STRUGGLINGSEMI-INDUSTRIALISED ECONOMY, THE UNEVEN LEVEL OF EDUCATION, AND LOW LEVELS OFRESEARCH ACTIVITY AND PUBLISHING OUTPUT. MODERNISATION MEANS THAT THE DEMANDFOR DOCUMENTS IS POTENTIALLY VERY LARGE. DOCUMENT SUPPLY WILL BE ORGANISEDTHROUGH DIFFERENT ECONOMIC OR ADMINISTRATIVE SECTORS, SUCH AS AGRICULTURE,ENERGY, OR EDUCATION. HOWEVER, THESE WILL NEED TO BE COORDINATED TO AVOID GAPSOR UNNECESSARY DUPLICATION IN SUBJECT COVERAGE, AND SOME DEGREE OFCENTRALISATION IS DESIRABLE.

THE AIM OF THE PRINCIPLES IS TO INCREASE LIBRARY STAFF'S AWARENESS OFTHE NECESSITY OF PRESERVING AND RESTORING NOT ONLY ARCHIVE MATERIAL BUT ALSOCONTEMPORARY LITERATURE COLLECTIONS. THE MOST IMPORTANT PRINCIPLE IS THAT OFSUITABLE STORAGE FACILITIES. MOST COMMON FORMS OF DAMAGE OCCUR THROUGHUNSTABLE CLIMATIC CONDITIONS, INCORRECT LIGHTING, DUST, BIOLOGICAL CAUSES(MICRO-ORGANISMS AND INSECTS) AND CHEMICAL CAUSES (OXIDATION AND HYDROLYSIS OFTHE CELLULOSE). TO PROTECT ORIGINAL MATERIAL, COPIES SHOULD BE LENT TO THEUSER WHENEVER POSSIBLE. RESTORATION SHOULD ONLY BE CARRIED OUT WHEN IT ISUNAVOIDABLE. EVERY STEP OF THE RESTORATION PROCESS SHOULD BE DOCUMENTED ASLIBRARIANS SHOULD REALISE THAT EVEN EXPERT RESTORATION CAN LEAD TOFALSIFICATION AND DISTORTION OF THE ORIGINAL .
