567|BOOKS FOR ALL.THE PHYSICALLY AND MENTALLY HANDICAPPED, CONTRIBUTE ROUGHLY 6|% OFCZECHOSLOVAKIA'S POPULATION. TO THIS END, THE NATIONAL CONFERENCE AT POPRAD,(SLOVAKIA), HELD IN MAY 81| DEALT WITH THE IMPROVEMENT OF LIBRARY SERVICES FORHANDICAPPED PEOPLE. THE LECTURES GIVEN SHOWED A GOOD THEORETICAL FOUNDATIONVERY OFTEN MORE ADVANCED THAN THE PRACTICAL ASSISTANCE GIVEN TO THEHANDICAPPED AND DISABLED. LIBRARIANS CAN INFLUENCE THE GENERAL PUBLIC'SATTITUDE TO THEIR HANDICAPPED FELLOW-CITIZENS. THE CONFERENCE PARTICIPANTSMADE SOME USEFUL SUGGESTIONS, FOR EXAMPLE, ADJUSTMENT OF LIBRARY EQUIPMENT FORTHE HANDICAPPED, DEVELOPMENT OF READING AIDS FOR BEDRIDDEN PEOPLE AND THELIKE, AND THERE WAS ALSO AN APPEAL TO THE PRESS FOR FULL COVERAGE OF THESE ANDMANY OTHER PROBLEMS FACING THE HANDICAPPED IN THIS, THE INTERNATIONAL YEAR OFTHE DISABLED.
568|THE HANDICAPPED AND LIBRARIES.THE HANDICAPPED ARE DEPENDENT ON THE GENERAL PUBLIC FOR SPREADING KNOWLEDGE OFAVAILABLE AIDS AND THE ROLE OF LIBRARIES. SOCIETY CREATES THE HANDICAP BYMAKING ACTIVITIES UNAVAILABLE. IT IS THEREFORE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF SOCIETYAND INDIVIDUALS TO SEE THAT OBSTACLES ARE REMOVED NOT JUST TO BETTER LIVINGCONDITIONS, BUT ALSO TO A FULL CULTURAL LIFE FOR THE HANDICAPPED. THE DEMANDFOR INFORMATION ON MATERIAL FOR THE HANDICAPPED AVAILABLE IN LIBRARIES WASSHOWN IN A CAMPAIGN LED BY KALMAR REGIONAL LIBRARY TO BE GROWING AMONGTEACHERS TRYING TO INTEGRATE THE HANDICAPPED IN SCHOOLS. STAFF WITHIN THESOCIAL INSTITUTIONS CAN ALSO ACT AS LINKS BETWEEN THE HANDICAPPED AND THELIBRARY. THE REGIONAL LIBRARY MUST STIMULATE LOCAL LIBRARIES TO INITIATEDOMICILIARY SERVICES AND ESTABLISH SYSTEMS FOR LENDING OF SPEAKING BOOKS ANDPERSONAL CONTACTS WITH USERS. THE MASS MEDIA AND SPECIAL TEACHERS ARE OTHERMEANS OF REACHING THE HANDICAPPED WITH INFORMATION ABOUT LIBRARY SERVI CES.
569|INFORMATION SERVICES TO DISABLED INDIVIDUALS.A SPECIAL ISSUE COMPRISING 7| ARTICLES, FOR ABSTRACTS OF WHICH SEE THEFOLLOWING SERIAL NUMBERS'.
570|ARCHITECTURAL AND PROGRAM ACCESSIBILITY' A REVIEW OF LIBRARY PROGRAMS,FACILITIES AND PUBLICATIONS FOR LIBRARIANS SERVING DISABLED INDIVIDUALS.CONTRIBUTION TO A THEMATIC ISSUE ON INFORMATION SERVICES FOR THE DISABLED.DISCUSSES THE SOCIAL, ATTITUDINAL, AND PHYSICAL BARRIERS THAT HAVEHISTORICALLY CONFRONTED HANDICAPPED PEOPLE; OUTLINES RELEVANT LEGISLATION; ANDLISTS MAJOR PUBLICATIONS AND RESOURCES OF INTEREST TO LIBRARIANS.
571|MAKE LIBRARIES ACCESSIBLE TO ALL!.6| YEARS AFTER THE GOVERNMENT AGREED ON A NEW CULTURAL POLICY, NO PROPOSALS FORSUCH A POLICY ON THE NEEDS OF THE HANDICAPPED EXIST. DESPITE OUR CONCERN FORFREEDOM OF EXPRESSION, MANY HANDICAPPED ARE DENIED ACCESS TO THE SPOKEN ANDPRINTED WORD. LIBRARIES HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO MAKE THEIR CULTURAL ACTIVITIESAVAILABLE TO ALL. DIRECT PHYSICAL ACCESSIBILITY MEANS THAT THE HANDICAPPED CANREACH THE LIBRARY, ENTER IT AND STAY THERE. BUT IMPROVED BUILDINGS ANDTRANSPORT CANNOT REPLACE THE DOMICILIARY LIBRARY SERVICE. INDIRECTACCESSIBILITY MEANS THAT LIBRARY ACTIVITIES AND MEDIA MUST BE ADAPTED TO REACHNEW GROUPS. 'EASY READERS' ARE AN EXAMPLE OF SUCH A MEDIUM AND THEIRPUBLICATION AND DISTRIBUTION THROUGH LIBRARIES ARE DISCUSSED. THE NEW STATELIBRARY FOR SPEECH AND BRAILLE PRINTING IS THE 1|ST STAGE IN PROVISION FOR THEBLIND AND PARTIALLY-SIGHTED; THE NEXT IS THE INCREASED DISTRIBUTION OF SUCHMATERIAL TO OTHER GROUPS.
572|LIBRARY SERVICE TO THE VISUALLY HANDICAPPED IN MALAYSIA.REPORTS ON A UNESCO PROJECT CONCERNED WITH THE VISUALLY HANDICAPPED INMALAYSIA TO REVIEW PRESENT SERVICES, SET UP A MODEL FOR A SERVICE AT THENATIONAL LIBRARY, KUALA LUMPUR, RECOMMEND IMPROVEMENTS TO PRESENT SERVICES ANDORGANISE A SEMINAR. ONLY 8|,000| OF AN ESTIMATED 40|,000| BLIND IN WEST MALAYSIAARE REGISTERED AS THERE IS NO OBLIGATION TO DO SO. THE NATIONAL LIBRARY HOPESTO HAVE A SECTION FOR THE VISUALLY HANDICAPPED WHEN ITS NEW BUILDING IS READYIN 1983|, BUT SOME LARGE PRINT BOOKS ARE AVAILABLE ALREADY. MALAYSIA HAS 4|SOCIETIES FOR THE BLIND. THE MALAYAN ASSOCIATION IN KAULA LUMPUR PRODUCES ANDLENDS BRAILLE BOOKS TO REGISTERED USERS. TALKING BOOKS ARE PRODUCED BY ST.NICHOLAS SCHOOL FOR THE BLIND IN PENANG. MOST MATERIAL IS IN ENGLISH, BUT ITIS HOPED TO INCREASE THE PRODUCTION OF BOOKS IN MALAY AT THE EXPENSE OFENGLISH, AS THE LATTER MATERIAL CAN BE BORROWED FROM ABROAD.
573|THE LIBRARY FOR TALKING BOOKS AND BRAILLE.THE LIBRARY FOR TALKING BOOKS AND BRAILLE (TPB) WAS ESTABLISHED ON 1| JAN 80|WHEN THE STATE TOOK OVER THE LIBRARY ACTIVITIES OF THE SOCIETY FOR THE BLIND.THE 1|ST LIBRARY FOR THE BLIND HAD BEGUN IN 1892|, AND WITH THE ARRIVAL OF TAPESTHE SOCIETY BEGAN LENDING TALKING BOOKS IN 1955|, NOW AS CASSETTES THE DOMINANTMEDIUM. FROM THE START THE BOOKS WERE AVAILABLE IN THE PUBLIC LIBRARIES. THEBOOKS ARE SOLD AT COST PRICE BY THE LIBRARY SERVICE TO THE PUBLIC LIBRARIES.THE PROVISION WAS THE SUBJECT OF SEVERAL REPORTS, ABOVE ALL THE HANDICAPCOMMISSION'S REPORT CULTURE FOR ALL, 1976|. DIRECT LOANS TO INDIVIDUALS FROMTPB ARE FALLING, AND THE LIBRARY'S ROLE AS CENTRE FOR LOANS OF DEPOSITCOLLECTIONS IS GROWING. THE LIBRARY, WHICH IS LED BY 7| STATE APPOINTEES, HASUNITS FOR PRODUCTION, LENDING, EDUCATIONAL MATERIAL, DEVELOPMENT ANDINFORMATION.

575|INFORMATION EDUCATION OF PUPILS AND THE ROLE OF THE TEACHER.THE 'INFORMATION EDUCATION' OF SCHOOL CHILDREN IS NOT JUST THE RESPONSIBILITYOF LIBRARIANS, BUT IT SHOULD BE AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE MODERN TEACHINGPROCESS IN EVERY SUBJECT. SCHOOL LIBRARIES HAVE TRADITIONALLY OPERATED ON ARUDIMENTARY LEVEL AS BOOKSTOCKS WITH LENDING OUTLETS-MOSTLY SUPPLYINGLITERATURE RELEVANT TO THE TEACHING OF THE MOTHER TONGUE. THIS IS NO LONGERADEQUATE AND SCHOOL LIBRARIES MUST BE TRANSFORMED INTO UP-TO-DATE INFORMATIONAND STUDY CENTRES. THE SLOVAK MINISTRY OF EDUCATION HAS ISSUED A DIRECTIVE NO3767|/1979| WHICH ENVISAGES SCHOOL LIBRARIES FULFILLING 3| ROLES' SUPPLYINGLIBRARY AND INFORMATION MATERIAL TO BOTH TEACHERS AND PUPILS; CONTRIBUTING TOTHE UPBRINGING OF THE NEW SOCIALIST GENERATION THROUGH WORKING WITH BOOKS;EDUCATING BOTH TEACHERS AND PUPILS TO USE INFORMATION SOURCES INDEPENDENTLYDURING INDIVIDUAL STUDY, CAREER SELECTION AND LEISURE. ACQUISITION MUST PLACEGREATER EMPHASIS ON SCIENTIFIC, TE CHNICAL AND OTHER SUBJECT ORIENTED BOOKS.

577|USE STUDIES OF LIBRARY COLLECTIONS.EDITED VERSION OF 'USE AND THE USER' PRESENTED AT A COLLECTION DEVELOPMENTCOMMITTEE MEETING, 26| JUNE 79|. JUDGES THE MOST IMPORTANT GENERAL CONCLUSIONSREACHED SO FAR THROUGH LIBRARY MATERIALS USE STUDIES TO BE' (1|) RECORDED USEIN MANY LIBRARIES IS LOW; (2|) USE WITHIN THE LIBRARY PARALLELS CIRCULATION;(3|) PAST USE PREDICTS FUTURE USE; (4|) RECENT MATERIALS ARE USED MOREFREQUENTLY; AND (5|) AMERICANS USE FEW FOREIGN-LANGUAGE MATERIALS. DISCUSSESPROBLEMS OF MEASUREMENT AND INTERPRETATION.
578|AN EVALUATION OF CURRENT COLLECTION UTILIZATION METHODOLOGIES AND FINDINGS.A RECENT EVALUATION OF CURRENT RESEARCH INDICATES THAT THE USE OF LIBRARIESCANNOT BE COMPARED; BUT, THE USE OF LIBRARY COLLECTIONS CAN BE COMPARED IF THEOBJECTIVES FOR THE COLLECTIONS ARE THE SAME. THE REASONING BEHIND THIS THESISIS PROVIDED ALONG WITH AN EVALUATION OF CURRENT COLLECTION UTILISATIONMETHODOLOGIES AND FINDINGS. A SET OF VARIABLES THAT ARE TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR INCOMPARATIVE STUDIES IS ALSO PROVIDED.
579|THE RANGES OF LIFE INTERESTS AND READING INTERESTS AMONG ADULT USERS OF PUBLICLIBRARIES IN COMMUNITIES OF VARIOUS SIZES.(PHD THESIS-UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN.) DESCRIBES AQUESTIONNAIRE SURVEY OF USERS OF 6| ILLINOIS PUBLIC LIBRARIES SERVINGCOMMUNITIES OF VARIOUS SIZES. THE FINDINGS INDICATE THAT PUBLIC LIBRARIES TENDTO SERVE THE MORE EDUCATED, THE YOUNG, AND WHITE COLLAR WORKERS, WHO WEREINTERESTED IN A WIDE RANGE OF SUBJECTS. DISCUSSES THE IMPLICATIONS FOR LIBRARYACQUISITION POLICIES AND MAKES SUGGESTIONS FOR FURTHER RESEARCH IN RELATEDAREAS.
580|THE DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING OF A CONCEPTUAL MODEL OF PUBLIC LIBRARY USERBEHAVIOR.THE OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY WAS TO TEST THE FOLLOWING HIERARCHICAL MODEL'PUBLIC LIBRARY USE IS A FUNCTION OF (1|) INDIVIDUAL CHARACTERISTICS; (2|)AWARENESS OF LIBRARY SERVICES; (3|) PERCEIVED ACCESSIBILITY OF THE LIBRARY; (4|)PERCEIVED EASE OF USE OF THE LIBRARY; AND (5|) USE OF OTHER NON-PUBLICLIBRARIES. THE MODEL WAS TESTED WITH 4| DIFFERENT LIBRARY USE MEASURES-ADICHOTOMISED MEASURE OF USE AND NONUSE, AND, AMONG LIBRARY USERS, FREQUENCY OFUSE AND 2|-FACTOR ANALYTICALLY DERIVED INDEXES DESCRIPTIVE OF 2| DISTINCTLYDIFFERENT TYPES OF LIBRARY USE. TYPE 1| USE APPEARED TO MEASURE USE INTENSITY;TYPE 2|-IN-HOUSE USE. INTERVIEW DATA WERE COLLECTED FROM 202| RESIDENTS OFSYRACUSE, NEW YORK. RESULTS INDICATED THAT PUBLIC LIBRARY USERS PERCEIVED THELIBRARY AS MORE ACCESSIBLE THAN DID NONUSERS, AND USE FREQUENCY WAS RELATED TOAWARENESS OF SPECIAL LIBRARY PROGRAMMES, AS WAS INTENSITY OF USE, AND IN-HOUSEUSE WAS RELATED  TO USE OF OTHER LIBRARIES.
581|THE SUBJECT INTENSITY OF LIBRARY USE' SOME ASPECTS OF POLYTECHNIC LIBRARY USE.STUDIES OF SEVERAL ASPECTS OF LIBRARY USE IN POLYTECHNICS ARE REPORTED. ISSUESWERE INVESTIGATED IN 3| POLYTECHNIC LIBRARIES, REPRESENTING DIFFERENT LEVELS OFLIBRARY PROVISION, AND ANALYSED IN TERMS OF SIZE AND NOVELTY OF STOCK. NEWERSTOCK WAS FOUND TO BE PREFERRED ALMOST UNIVERSALLY, AND LARGER STOCKS WEREMORE HEAVILY USED.
582|GOVERNMENT DOCUMENTS USAGE IN AN ACADEMIC LIBRARY' THE CASE STUDY FROM IBADANUNIVERSITY LIBRARY.EXAMINES USAGE OF GOVERNMENT DOCUMENTS FOR RESEARCH AT IBADAN UNIVERSITYLIBRARY, NIGERIA. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT SUCH DOCUMENTS CONSTITUTE ASUBSTANTIAL PART OF THE MATERIALS USED FOR RESEARCH AND THAT STATISTICALPUBLICATIONS ARE THE MOST FREQUENTLY CONSULTED MATERIALS.
583|DOCUMENTATION AND LITERARY RESEARCH.A PAPER PRESENTED AT A 1980| QUEBEC CORPORATION DES BIBLIOTHECAIRESPROFESSIONNELS CONFERENCE, DISTINGUISHING THE INFORMATION NEEDS OF THELITERARY RESEARCHER FROM OTHER USER NEEDS. DISCUSSES IN DETAIL THE KIND OFDOCUMENTATION REQUIRED, AND SHOWS HOW THE NOTIONS OF OBSOLESCENCE ANDEXHAUSTIVITY ARE LARGELY IRRELEVANT. TO MEET THESE SPECIFIC NEEDS, QUEBECSHOULD ESTABLISH A UNION CATALOGUE OF RESEARCH RESOURCES AND A NATIONALRESEARCH LIBRARY; HERE THE COMPUTER IS NOT THE SOLUTION.
584|LIBRARIES AND SCIENCE.THE MAIN CONCERN OF LIBRARIES AND INFORMATION CENTRES SHOULD BE SPEEDY ANDEFFECTIVE SERVICE TO USERS. THEY MUST BE CONCERNED TO ELIMINATE ANYUNNECESSARY DELAYS, WHICH MAY CAUSE DELAYS IN THE SCIENTIST'S WORK. LIBRARIANSSHOULD TAKE AN ACTIVE INTEREST IN THE WORK OF THEIR USERS AND THEIR EDUCATIONAND PROFESSIONAL EXPERTISE SHOULD ALLOW THEM TO DO SO. A SURVEY IN THE SLOVAKACADEMY OF SCIENCE HAD SHOWN THAT MOST SOUGHT AFTER ARE INFORMATION SOURCES1|-3| YEARS OLD IN NATURAL SCIENCES AND MEDICINE, 1|-10| YEARS OLD IN THE SOCIALSCIENCES. GOOD ACQUISITION POLICY, QUALITY IN BIBLIOGRAPHICAL AND INFORMATIONSERVICES CONTRIBUTE TO FURTHER DEVELOPMENT AND SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNOLOGICALREVOLUTION.
585|USER SATISFACTION IN THE HUGH STEPHENS COLLEGE LIBRARY.A USER SURVEY WAS CONDUCTED AT THE HUGH STEPHENS COLLEGE LIBRARY TO DETERMINETHE DEGREE OF USER SATISFACTION AND IDENTIFY LIMITING FACTORS. ANALYSIS OFDATA FROM 203| DATA SHEETS COMPLETED BY PATRONS REQUESTING SPECIFIC TITLESREVEALS THAT ACQUISITIONS BY THE LIBRARY AND USER ERROR ARE MORE SIGNIFICANTLIMITING FACTORS IN THIS LIBRARY THAN EITHER CIRCULATION OR LIBRARY ERROR. ITIS RECOMMENDED THAT FURTHER STUDY BE MADE OF THE EXTENT OF USE OF THE HOLDINGSOF OTHER LIBRARIES, AND OF THE PROPORTION OF USERS WHO COME TO BROWSE ORSEARCH BY SUBJECT RATHER THAN SPECIFIC TITLE, BEFORE CHANGING ACQUISITIONSPOLICY. A SIGNIFICANT PROPORTION OF USER ERROR INDICATES A LACK OF ADEQUATELIBRARY SEARCHING TECHNIQUES, AND IT IS SUGGESTED THAT ASSISTANCE BE PROVIDEDFOR POTENTIAL USERS THROUGH SUCH MEANS AS LIBRARY ORIENTATION PROGRAMMES ANDSIGNS ALERTING THEM TO COMMONLY COMMITTED ERRORS OF THE LOCATION OF SPECIALCOLLECTIONS. REPORT NOT AVAILABL E FROM NTIS.
586|SOME ASPECTS OF THE LIBRARIAN-USER RELATIONSHIP.ARGUES THAT DIRECT LIBRARIAN-USER INTERACTION IS LONG OVERDUE FOR CLOSESCRUTINY, SINCE THIS RELATIONSHIP MAY NOT BE IN HARMONY WITH THE OVERALLSTANDARD OF OTHER SUBSYSTEMS OF THE INFORMATION CENTRE. POINTS OUT THAT, APARTFROM QUALIFICATIONS AND EXPERIENCE, A LIBRARIAN MUST ALSO POSSESS APERSONALITY WHICH IS PSYCHOLOGICALLY WELL BALANCED AND ADAPTABLE, SINCE AGREAT DEAL OF HIS/HER WORK INVOLVES EXPOSURE TO POTENTIALLY STRESSFULSITUATIONS. THESE SITUATIONS ARISE WITH USERS WHO ARE POORLY INFORMED ABOUTTHE PRACTICAL DIFFICULTIES ASSOCIATED WITH OBTAINING A PARTICULAR INFORMATIONSOURCE AND WHO ARE NOT ABLE TO APPRECIATE THAT OTHER READERS HAVE THEIRPRESSING REQUIREMENTS AS WELL. NAME TAGS FOR LIBRARIANS SHOULD LEAD TO GREATERPERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY. IN LARGE LIBRARIES DIRECT USER CONTACT INVOLVES SHIFTWORKING FOR THE PREDOMINANTLY FEMALE STAFF; THIS LEADS TO DIFFICULTIES ANDSOMETIMES LESS THAN ADEQUATE PERSONNEL ARE EXPOSED TO THE PU BLIC. THIS AREAOF LIBRARY SERVICES CRIES OUT FOR A SYSTEMATIC OVERHAUL.
587|CRISIS-CENTRED, ISSUE-BASED' THE LONELINESS OF DISTANCE LEARNING.ARGUES THAT UK LIBRARIES AND THE BRITISH BROADCASTING CORPORATION CONTINUINGEDUCATION HAVE THE SAME STAPLE CUSTOMER GROUP. AS PROVISION OF LOCAL AUTHORITYADULT EDUCATION CLASSES DROPS AND BUDGET CUTS BITE DEEP EVERYWHERE, IT WOULDBENEFIT BOTH ORGANISATIONS TO COOPERATE AND MAINTAIN A 'HIGH PROFILE'. FORTHEIR PART, LIBRARIES SHOULD PRESENT THEMSELVES AS PROVIDERS AND PARTNERS INADULT EDUCATION RATHER THAN AS SERVICING AGENTS; AGGRESSIVELY MARKET MATERIALSASSOCIATED WITH CONTINUING EDUCATION SERIES; AND USE THEIR CLOSENESS TO THECOMMUNITY TO ATTRACT AND SERVE THE WORKING CLASS. WITH ITS 4|,500| OUTLETS, THEUK LIBRARY SYSTEM IS A SLEEPING COMMUNITY EDUCATION GIANT-THE GIANT MUSTAWAKE.

592|EXPLANATIONS OF THE BIBLIOMETRIC LAWS.MANY LIBRARIANS ARE FAMILIAR WITH BRADFORD'S LAW OF SCATTERING AS ADESCRIPTION OF HOW ARTICLES IN A DISCIPLINE ARE DISPERSED OVER THE UNIVERSE OFJOURNALS.

830|AUTOMATED CIRCULATION SYSTEMS VIS-A-VIS AUTOMATED CATALOGUING.AN AUTOMATED CIRCULATION SYSTEM SHOULD NOT BE DEVELOPED WITHOUT DUE REGARD TOAN EXISTING AUTOMATED CATALOGUING SYSTEM. ABOVE ALL, THERE SHOULD BE THEFACILITY FOR DATA EXCHANGE, TO PRODUCE MACHINE-READABLE BOOK LABELS, AND TOESTABLISH THE NECESSARY FILES WITHOUT DUPLICATION OF DATA. THERE ARE PROBLEMS,HOWEVER, AS CATALOGUE AND LENDING ARE BASED UPON TITLE-ENTRY AND BOOK ASPHYSICAL UNIT RESPECTIVELY, AND FURTHER, THE COMPLEX STRUCTURE OF TITLE-ENTRYAND CALL NUMBER.

833|GROUP PROCESSING OF LITERATURE.LARGE LIBRARIES ARE ALWAYS TRYING TO REDUCE THE SIZE OF THEIR CATALOGUES AND,AT THE SAME TIME, TO SIMPLIFY THE RETRIEVAL OF INDIVIDUAL INDEXED ITEMS. THEBULK OF LIBRARY STOCK MUST BE INDEXED INDIVIDUALLY, HOWEVER, THERE IS ACERTAIN TYPE OF LITERATURE, SUCH AS INFORMATION LEAFLETS, PROMOTIONALLITERATURE, WHICH IS SUITABLE FOR GROUP PROCESSING (1| CATALOGUE CARD IS USEDFOR A SERIES OF ITEMS FOR EXAMPLE). THE MAIN LIBRARY OF LENINGRAD POLYTECHNICPREPARED 'INSTRUCTIONS FOR GROUP PROCESSING OF INFORMATION LITERATURE' IN1977|. THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THESE INSTRUCTIONS IS DISCUSSED.

846|SAP-A NEW WAY TO PRODUCE SUBJECT DESCRIPTIONS.WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THE SUBJECT ACCESS PROJECT (SAP), AT LUND UNIVERSITYLIBRARY, SWEDEN, A NEW VERSION OF ON-LINE CATALOGUE FOR MONOGRAPHS HAS BEENDEVELOPED. USING THE SAP-INDEXING METHOD, EXISTING BIBLIOGRAPHIC CATALOGUERECORDS HAVE BEEN ENRICHED WITH SELECTED TERMS FROM CONTENTS TABLES AND BOOKINDEXES. THE IDEA OF SAP IS TO PRODUCE SUBJECT DESCRIPTIONS OF BOOKS TAKENFROM THE BOOKS THEMSELVES AND TO MAKE MORE USE OF A PUBLICATION'S 'INHERENT'ATTRIBUTES. IT IS ALSO AN APPROACH TO THE SHORTCOMINGS OF CLASSIFICATIONSYSTEMS IN DESCRIBING A BOOK'S CONTENTS BY MEANS OF A LIMITED NUMBER OFCLASSIFICATION CODES. BY SAP, LOW COST RETRIEVAL CAPABILITIES ARE PROVIDED FORMONOGRAPH USERS.
