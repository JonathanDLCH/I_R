ISBNS WILL BE USED TO IDENTIFYPUBLISHERS AND STANDARD ADDRESS NUMBERS (SAN), DEVELOPED BY BISAC, TO IDENTIFYLIBRARY VENDORS, PUBLIC, ACADEMIC AND AND SCHOOL LIBRARIES.
5856|ONLINE ORDERING. A COMPARISON OF DOCUMENT SUPPLIERS.DESCRIBES A STUDY WHERE DIFFERENT TYPES OF DOCUMENTS HAVE BEEN SIMULATANEOUSLYORDERED ON-LINE FROM 9| SELECTED DOCUMENT SUPPLIERS. CONSIDERABLE DIFFERENCESAS TO COST, SPEED OF DELIVERY AND RELIABILITY OF DELIVERY HAVE BEEN OBSERVED.THIS IS RELATED TO THE TYPE OF DOCUMENT, THE COUNTRY OF PUBLICATION AND THESUBJECT CONTENT OF THE MATERIAL. ON-LINE ORDERING AS A ROUTINE IN LIBRARYACQUISITION WORK IS DISCUSSED.
5857|THE DEUTSCHE STAATSBIBLIOTHEK AS A CENTRE FOR INTER-LIBRARY LOANS AND UNIONCATALOGUING.IN THE 1970|S THE LIBRARY FOUNDED A SPECIAL INSTITUTE TO COPE WITHINTER-LIBRARY LOANS AND UNION CATALOGUING. THE INSTITUTE'S WORK HAS INCLUDEDACCELERATING ORDERING PROCEDURES, ORGANISING COPYRIGHT DEPOSIT ANDINTERNATIONAL INTER-LOAN SCHEMES, IMPROVING STAFF QUALIFICATIONS, SOLVINGLEGAL PROBLEMS CONNECTED WITH THE USE OF ELECTRONIC DATA PROCESSING, KEEPINGCATALOGUES UP TO DATE AND DEVELOPING A COURIER SERVICE. SINCE 1978| STATISTICSHAVE BEEN COMPILED ON THE 400| LIBRARIES INVOLVED IN TELETEXT SERVICES. CURRENTPROJECTS INCLUDE COMPUTERISATION OF THE CENTRAL UNION CATALOGUE AND OF THEINDEX OF FOREIGN PERIODICALS AND SERIALS. THE INSTITUTE PLAYS AN ACTIVE PARTIN INTER-LIBRARY COOPERATION BETWEEN THE COMMUNIST COUNTRIES.
5858|TRANSPORT SCHEMES FOR INTERLIBRARY LENDING' THE UK EXPERIENCE.WHERE POSTAL SERVICES ARE SLOW, UNRELIABLE OR EXPENSIVE, DEDICATED TRANSPORTSCHEMES FOR INTERLENDING PURPOSES SHOULD BE CONSIDERED; THEIR USEFULNESS WILLVARY FROM 1| COUNTRY TO ANOTHER, ACCORDING TO LOCAL CIRCUMSTANCES. IN THE UK,FEASIBILITY STUDIES WERE FOLLOWED BY THE SETTING UP OF TRANSPORT SCHEMES IN ANUMBER OF THE UK LIBRARY REGIONS, AND A NATIONAL SCHEME LINKING THE REGIONSWAS ENVISAGED. TRANSPORT SCHEMES WERE NOT CONSIDERED WORTHWHILE IN THE LARGERREGIONS WITH LESS INTERLENDING ACTIVITY. A METHODOLOGY FOR SETTING UP SCHEMESHAS BEEN DEVISED. THE PRESENT TRANSPORT SCHEMES ARE FINANCIALLY COMPETITIVEAND LIKELY TO REMAIN SO. UK EXPERIENCE MIGHT PROVIDE A FRAMEWORK FOR ASSESSINGPOTENTIAL SCHEMES IN OTHER COUNTRIES.
5859|ON CHARGING FOR INFORMATION SERVICES.COMMENTS ON A REPORT BY THE DELEGATION FOR SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICALINFORMATION PROVISION' 2|INFORMATION AT ANY PRICE' ON CHARGING FOR INFORMATIONSERVICES1|, IN WHICH IT IS SUGGESTED THAT INTERLENDING FROM SCIENTIFICLIBRARIES SHOULD BE CHARGED AT A STANDARD RATE PER LOAN, DESPITE THE FACT THATCHARGING FOR TRADITIONAL LIBRARY SERVICES WAS EXCLUDED FROM THE COMMISSION'SREMIT. 1| REASON FOR CONSIDERING CHARGES NONETHELESS IS THE INCREASING SCOPEAND COST OF INTERLENDING. ANOTHER IS THE CHANGE IN THE BUDGETING OFINSTITUTIONS FOR TERTIARY EDUCATION WHICH HAS TRANSFERRED LIBRARY ALLOCATIONSFROM THE STATE TO THE INSTITUTIONS; THESE ARE TEMPTED TO ACHIEVE SAVINGSTHROUGH CHARGES ON INTERLENDING. THE REPORT REGARDS INTERLENDING OF LITTLEIMPORTANCE TO PUBLIC LIBRARIES. IT DOES NOT ATTEMPT TO CALCULATE THE COST OFINTERLENDING, NOR THE COST OF ADMINISTERING A SYSTEM OF CHARGES.
5860|INTERLIBRARY LENDING IN THE NETHERLANDS.INTERLENDING IN THE NETHERLANDS IS BASED ON A NATIONAL SYSTEM FOR THE SUPPLYOF SCHOLARLY LITERATURE AND A REGIONAL SYSTEM FOR SUPPLYING A WIDER RANGE OFMATERIAL MAINLY BETWEEN PUBLIC LIBRARIES. 725|,000| REQUESTS WERE MADE IN 1979|.MOST REQUESTS ARE SATISFIED THROUGH UNION CATALOGUES OR PRINTED UNION LISTS.IN ADDITION TO THE 12| PROVINCIAL CENTRES, THE 13| REGIONAL SUPPORT LIBRARIESHAVE A CENTRAL ROLE IN THE REGIONAL SUPPLY SYSTEM; THEY RECEIVED 131|,708|REQUESTS IN 1980| AND SATISFIED 27|%. A SINGLE CENTRE IN EACH REGION ISRECOMMENDED. A SURVEY OF THE NATIONAL SYSTEM SHOWED THAT 40|% OF ALL REQUESTSAT THIS LEVEL CAME FROM ACADEMIC LIBRARIES, 40|% FROM SPECIAL LIBRARIES AND 20|%FROM PUBLIC LIBRARIES. MOST REQUESTS ARE FOR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY (60|%), FORENGLISH LANGUAGE MATERIAL (55|% OF ALL REQUESTS; 70|% OF REQUESTS FOR JOURNALS),AND FOR MORE RECENT MATERIAL (65|% PUBLISHED IN THE LAST 10| YEARS). THESATISFACTION RATE WAS 76|% (HIGHER FOR REQ UESTS SENT TO UNION CATALOGUES): 1|/2|WERE SUPPLIED IN 2| WEEKS, 2|/3| IN 3| WEEKS IMPORTANT GAPS IN JOURNAL COVERAGEWERE IDENTIFIED. AN ON-LINE NATIONAL UNION CATALOGUE WILL BE AVAILABLE IN 1984|AND WILL BE USED TO DISTRIBUTE REQUESTS MORE EVENLY BETWEEN LIBRARIES, BUTSPECIFIC GRANTS TO SUPPORT THE INTERLENDING FUNCTION IN MAJOR SUPPLYINGLIBRARIES WILL STILL BE NECESSARY, AND CHARGES SHOULD BE MADE. IMPROVED UNIONCATALOGUES ARE ENVISAGED AT THE REGIONAL LEVEL ALSO.
5861|A PROPOSAL FOR PLANNING AN INTERLENDING SYSTEM FOR THE LIBRARIES OF CAIROCITY, EGYPT.(PHD DISSERTATION-PITTSBURGH UNIVERSITY). A QUESTIONNAIRE SURVEY, INTERVIEWS,VISITS, AND A LITERATURE ANALYSIS WERE USED TO EXPOSE THE FACTORS RESPONSIBLEFOR THE PRESENT STATE OF INTERLIBRARY LOAN IN CAIRO. A SYSTEM FOR FORMALINTERLIBRARY LENDING WHICH CAN BE MODIFIED FOR OTHER DEVELOPING COUNTRIES ISPROPOSED.
5862|PLANNING INTERLENDING SYSTEMS IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES.BASED ON REPORTS DESCRIBING THE EXTENT AND DEVELOPMENT OF INTERLIBRARY LOANSYSTEMS IN SEVERAL OF THE DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, A COMPOSITE IS DRAWN OF THEDIFFICULTIES AND PROBLEMS WHICH ARISE IN THE PLANNING STAGES AND EXECUTION OFSUCH SYSTEMS IN THESE COUNTRIES. FINANCIAL PROBLEMS, AS WELL AS PROBLEMS OFLIBRARY POLICY, AND THE REALISTIC POSSIBILITIES CONNECTED WITH THE LITERATURESUPPLY AND CORRESPONDING NEED FOR AN INTERLIBRARY LOAN PROGRAMME IN THESECOUNTRIES ARE POINTED OUT. ATTENTION IS ALSO GIVEN TO THE RELATIONSHIP OF THELOCAL LIBRARIES TO THE NATIONAL LIBRARY. CONSIDERATIONS WHICH SHOULD BE MADEIN FINDING REALISTIC SOLUTIONS TO THESE PROBLEMS ON A LONG-TERM BASIS CONCLUDETHE REPORT.
5863|CORE COLLECTIONS OF JOURNALS FOR NATIONAL INTERLENDING PURPOSES.CENTRALISED NATIONAL PROVISION FOR INTERLENDING PROVIDES A BETTER SERVICE THANDECENTRALISED PROVISION BUT CAN BE DIFFICULT AND EXPENSIVE TO IMPLEMENT, SOPARTIAL CENTRALISATION SHOULD BE CONSIDERED. JOURNALS ARE SPECIALLY SUITED TOCENTRAL COLLECTIONS. CONCENTRATION OF DEMAND ON A RELATIVELY SMALL NUMBER OFJOURNALS MEANS THAT COLLECTIONS OF 7|,000|-8|,000| TITLES COULD SUPPLY 80|% OFDEMAND AND 2|,000| TITLES 50|% IN MANY COUNTRIES. THERE ARE HOWEVER PROBLEMS INIDENTIFYING JOURNALS FOR CORE COLLECTIONS. BIBLIOMETRIC METHODS CAN BE SHOWNTO BE OF LITTLE HELP. ANALYSIS OF DEMAND AT THE BRITISH LIBRARY LENDINGDIVISION INDICATES THAT RANK LISTS ARE NOT VERY STABLE OVER TIME; AND VARIOUSFACTORS SUCH AS LANGUAGE OR STAGE OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT WILL CAUSEVARIATIONS THAT MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO APPLY CORE LISTS BETWEEN COUNTRIES(THOUGH IT MAY BE POSSIBLE TO ALLOW FOR DIFFERENCES, ESPECIALLY IF CORE LISTSBASED ON CURRENT DEMAND COULD BE OBTAINED FROM A NUMBER OF DIFFERENTCOUNTRIES). ONCE A CORE COLLECTION HAD BEEN SET UP, IT WOULD HAVE TO ATTRACTSUFFICIENT REQUESTS TO MONITOR DEMAND AND ADJUST ITS CONTENTS ACCORDINGLY. IFA COMPREHENSIVE COLLECTION IS NOT POSSIBLE, LIMITATION TO CERTAIN SUBJECTS HASADVANTAGES. AS COLLECTIONS GROW, ADDITIONAL JOURNALS WILL BE CHEAPER TOACQUIRE, THOUGH THE UNIT COST PER REQUEST WILL STILL BE LOWER FOR THE JOURNALSIN HEAVIEST DEMAND. CONCLUDES THAT THE CONCEPT OF CORE COLLECTIONS IS SOUND,BUT FURTHER DATA ARE NEEDED BEFORE THE PRACTICAL PROBLEMS OF SETTING UP SUCHCOLLECTIONS CAN BE PROPERLY ASSESSED.

THE LARGE NUMBER OFCLASSIFICATION SYSTEMS USED BY GERMAN UNIVERSITY AND RESEARCH LIBRARIES WASSEEN AS AN OBSTACLE TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF NATIONAL SYSTEMS OF BIBLIOGRAPHICCONTROL AND ACCESS. THE HOPE OF STANDARDISATION CAME TO NOTHING; FOCKE'S CODEMAY EVEN HAVE HAD THE OPPOSITE EFFECT OF PERPETUATING LOCAL SYSTEMS WELL INTOTHE 20|TH CENTURY. HIS WORK WAS INTRODUCED TO LIBRARIANS IN THE USA AT A TIMEWHEN SUBJECT CATALOGUING AND CLASSIFICATION WERE IN TRANSITION. HIS CODE ISCONSISTENT WITH THE GENERAL PRINCIPLES UNDERLYING THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESSCLASSIFICATION, WHICH MAY HAVE BEEN MORE INFLUENCED BY 19|TH CENTURY GERMANCLASSIFICATION THAN HAS HERTOFORE BEEN RECOGNISED.

5952|OUTLINE OF A SOCIETY OF FREELY AVAILABLE INFORMATION.TODAY TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATIONS IN MANY FIELDS CAUSE SOCIAL CHANGES ALMOSTBEFORE SOCIETY HAS BECOME AWARE OF THEIR EXISTENCE. VERY OFTEN NEGATIVEINFLUENCES OF CERTAIN INNOVATIONS HAVE NOT BEEN THOROUGHLY INVESTIGATEDBEFOREHAND. THIS HAS LED TO THE GROWTH OF MANY COUNTER MOVEMENTS IN SOCIETY.IT IS NECESSARY TO FIND COMMON GROUND BETWEEN REPRESENTATIVES OF 'ESTABLISHED'AND 'ALTERNATIVE' STYLES OF LIVING, IN ORDER TO ENSURE THE CONTINUATION OFINNOVATION IN SOCIETY. INITIATIVE, CREATIVITY AND COOPERATION, THE VITALFACTORS FOR TECHNOLOGICAL AND ECONOMIC INNOVATION, ARE EVIDENT IN BOTH GROUPS,ONLY OPINIONS AS TO THE BEST MEANS OF EMPLOYING THEM DIFFER. TODAY A NEWELECTRONIC INFORMATION NETWORK IS GRADUALLY LINKING MANKIND. THE WORLD ISBECOMING A 'GLOBAL VILLAGE' AT LEAST ON THE LEVEL OF TECHNOLOGICALCOMMUNICATIONS STRUCTURES.

5959|READ TO THEM.FEW PARENTS REGULARLY READ STORIES ALOUD TO THEIR CHILDREN. THE AFFECTIONATEATMOSPHERE GIVEN BY READING A STORY IS REASSURING AND SECURITY-BUILDING AT ANYAGE. IT IS A MISTAKE TO DISCONTINUE THE PRACTICE. THE CHILD LEARNS LANGUAGE,AND ABOUT THE WRITTEN WORD THROUGH THIS. READING TO HIM CAN HELP HIM TOUNDERSTAND CONCEPTS HE CANNOT GRASP BY READING TO HIMSELF. LITERATURE WITHHUMOUR, INSIGHT AND MATURITY NEEDS TO BE SOUGHT. CHILDREN FROM LITERARY RATHERTHAN GIFTED BACKGROUNDS ARE THE BEST READERS.
5960|STUDY OF RECREATIONAL READING IN THE FIRST GRADE MUNICIPAL SCHOOLS IN BELOHORIZONTE, BRAZIL.REPORT BASED ON A POSTGRADUATE THESIS, PRESENTED AT UFMG LIBRARY SCHOOL,BRAZIL. THE READING HABITS OF A 5|% SAMPLE OF PUPILS WERE INVESTIGATED BYQUESTIONNAIRE, AND SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM TEACHERS AND SCHOOLLIBRARIANS.
