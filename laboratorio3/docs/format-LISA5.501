HOWEVER, IN SPITE OF THE CONDITIONS, LIBRARY ANDINFORMATION SERVICES MUST BE UNDER CONSTANT REVIEW WITH THEIR IMPROVEMENT INMIND. BRANCHES ESTABLISHED IN THE STUDENTS' HALLS OF RESIDENCE HAVE TO PROVIDEALL STUDENTS WITH BASIC STUDY LITERATURE. THE CENTRAL LIBRARY OF ANYPARTICULAR ESTABLISHMENT HAS TO CATER FOR CENTRALISED AND COORDINATEDACQUISITIONS AND PROCESSING. USE OF LITERATURE BY STUDENTS AND TEACHING STAFFMUST ALSO BE FOLLOWED UP AND OBSOLETE ITEMS DISCARDED. GREATER ATTENTION MUSTBE PAID TO POLITICAL AND OTHER LITERATURE DEALING WITH SOCIAL SCIENCES,ESPECIALLY IN FACULTIES OF APPLIED SCIENCE. IT IS IMPORTANT TO SUPPORTAESTHETIC EDUCATION BY AUDIO-VISUAL MATERIALS. THE ROLE OF COMPUTERISEDINFORMATION SYSTEMS, NOW ON A TRIAL BASIS IN SCHOOLS OF ECON OMICS, WILL GROWIN FUTURE. FOR EXPERT ADVICE LIBRARIES IN HIGHER EDUCATION HAVE TO LOOK ABOVEALL TO THE UNIVERSITY LIBRARY IN SOFIA WITH ITS METHODOLOGICAL DEPARTMENT ANDSPECIAL COUNCILS IN MANY SPHERES OF KNOWLEDGE.
