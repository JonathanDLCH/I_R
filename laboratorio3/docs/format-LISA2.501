2509|OUR TASKS.     THE OFFICIAL 1977|-UNESCO STATISTICS SHOW THAT, AS FAR AS NUMBERS OF LIBRARIESAND LIBRARIANS, AND ALSO ANNUAL ACQUISITIONS PER HEAD OF POPULATION, ARECONCERNED, BULGARIA LIES IN THE 7|TH AND 4|TH PLACES RESPECTIVELY IN THE WORLD.HOWEVER, BULGARIA TAKES THE 14|TH AND 19|TH PLACES IN LOANS AND IN TURNOVER OFCURRENT BOOK COLLECTIONS. THUS, HIGHER EFFICIENCY REQUIRED IN ALL FIELDS OFTHE NATION'S LIFE BY THE RECENT 12|TH CONGRESS OF THE BULGARIAN COMMUNIST PARTYMUST ALSO BE AIMED FOR IN LIBRARIES AND INFORMATION CENTRES. GREAT ATTENTIONMUST BE PAID IN PARTICULAR TO SCIENTIFIC AND OTHER SPECIAL LIBRARIES WHICHNEED TO COPE NOT ONLY WITH THE PRESENT INFORMATION EXPLOSION, BUT ALSO WITHSOARING PRICES OF WESTERN PUBLICATIONS AND BULGARIA'S LIMITED FOREIGN CURRENCYRESOURCES. AMONGST OTHER PROBLEMS ARE THE EDUCATION AND TRAINING OFLIBRARIANS, THE NEEDS IN NEW LIBRARY BUILDINGS, MECHANISATION, AUTOMATION, ANDUPDATING OF LIBRARY MANAGEMENT. THE CYRIL AND METHODIUS NATIONAL LIBRARY, NOTONLY AS KEEPER OF THE NATIONAL LITERARY HERITAGE, BUT ALSO AS THE MOSTIMPORTANT LIBRARY AND INFORMATION CENTRE IN THE WHOLE COUNTRY, IS, IN ITSELF,A SPECIAL CASE. IT SHOULD BE RELIEVED OF SOME OF ITS PROBLEMS ON THE OCCASIONOF THE 1300|TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE BULGARIAN STATE.

ASPECTS OF LIBRARIANSHIP AFFECTED BY STANDARDS INTRODUCED SINCETHEN INCLUDE' THE BIBLIOGRAPHICAL DESCRIPTION OF MUSIC AND MAPS, REFERENCEBOOKS IN SERVICE POINTS, BASIC TERMS AND DEFINITIONS IN SCIENTIFIC INFORMATIONWORK, AND A SINGLE NATIONAL SYSTEM OF INTER-LIBRARY LOANS.
2517|BULGARIAN PERIODICALS AS AN INFORMATION SOURCE ON LIBRARIANSHIP.     ONE OF THE SPECIAL BIBLIOGRAPHIES PUBLISHED BY THE CYRIL AND METHODIUSNATIONAL LIBRARY IN SOFIA COVERS LITERATURE ON LIBRARIANSHIP, BIBLIOGRAPHY ANDINFORMATION SCIENCE. FROM 1967|-76|, 4330| HEADINGS WERE LISTED. MORE THAN 90|%WERE ARTICLES AND SPECIAL PAPERS, AND ONLY THE REMAINING 10|% INCLUDED BOOKS.NATIONAL DAILIES AS WELL AS REGIONAL AND LOCAL PAPERS ALSO PAID ATTENTION TOLIBRARIES. THEY EMPHASISED, HOWEVER, MOSTLY GENERAL ISSUES OR TOPICS OF LOCALINTEREST AND TIMING FREQUENCY AS WELL AS STANDARDS VARIED CONSIDERABLY. SINCE1954|, 2|BIBLIOTEKAR1| HAS BEEN ALMOST THE ONLY STABLE PERIODICAL FOR LIBRARIANSAND HAS SO FAR REMAINED THE ONLY BULGARIAN PERIODICAL OF THIS KIND KNOWN ANDABSTRACTED ABROAD. INFORMATION SCIENTISTS HAVE LACKED THEIR OWN SPECIALPERIODICAL. THE GAP HAS BEEN PARTLY FILLED BY THE EFFORT OF THE CENTRALLIBRARY OF THE BULGARIAN ACADEMY OF SCIENCES.

2530|DRAMATIC RISE IN THE NUMBER OF CENSORSHIP CASES.     INTERVIEWS JUDITH F. KRUG, LEADER OF THE AMERICAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION'S OFFICEFOR INTELLECTUAL FREEDOM. ITS WORK IS BASED ON THE FIRST AMENDMENT OF THE U.S.CONSTITUTION AND ON THE ALA'S LIBRARY BILL OF RIGHTS. IT BEGAN AS THEINTELLECTUAL FREEDOM COMMITTEE IN 1940|. UNTIL RECENTLY ALMOST ALL CASES CAMEFROM SCHOOL LIBRARIES, BUT SINCE THE REAGAN ADMINISTRATION TOOK OFFICE THEMOST IMPORTANT CASES ORIGINATE WITH THE PUBLIC LIBRARIES. THE OFFICE, HOWEVER,DOES NOT CONFINE ITSELF TO TAKING UP CASES WITHIN THE LIBRARY SECTOR, BUT ITKEEPS LIBRARIANS AND THE PUBLIC INFORMED OF THE IMPORTANCE OF THE FIRSTAMENDMENT, ISSUES PUBLICATIONS, AND HOLDS SEMINARS. MANY ATTEMPTS ATCENSORSHIP COME FROM THE MORAL MAJORITY MOVEMENT. THE OFFICE FINDS IT EASIERTO DEAL WITH LIBRARIES WHICH HAVE A CLEARLY FORMULATED SELECTION POLICY, ANDIN VERY FEW CASES DOES IT RECOMMEND REFUSAL TO ACQUIRE A PARTICULAR BOOK. THELEGAL SIDE OF ALA IS DEALT WITH BY A SEPARATE,  BUT RELATED BODY, THE FREEDOMTO READ FOUNDATION.
2531|THE YOUNG ADULT AND INTELLECTUAL FREEDOM IN THE LIBRARY. A SELECTIVEBIBLIOGRAPHY AND CRITICAL REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE.     DESIGNED FOR LIBRARIANS PLANNING COMMUNITY ORIENTED PROGRAMMES, THIS ANNOTATEDBIBLIOGRAPHY CRITICALLY REVIEWS LITERATURE DEFENDING THE YOUNG ADULT'S RIGHTTO INTELLECTUAL FREEDOM.

EXAMINES THE 2|ANNUAL REVIEW OFINFORMATION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY1| FROM 1966|-75|, FOR EVIDENCE OF THEDEVELOPING INTELLECTUAL STRUCTURE OF THE DISCIPLINE OF INFORMATION SCIENCE.THIS STRUCTURE IS VIEWED AS BEING COMPOSED OF THE CONCEPTS WHICH FORM THEINTELLECTUAL TERRITORY OF THE DISCIPLINE AND THEIR ORGANISATION INTO TOPICSRESEARCH AREAS AND SUB-FIELDS. A PRIMARY FUNCTION OF REVIEW LITERATURE IS SEENTO BE THE MAPPING OF THE INTELLECTUAL STRUCTURE OF THE DISCIPLINE. EXAMINESCONCEPTS UNDERLYING AUTHORS' NATURAL LANGUAGE. ATTEMPTS TO PRODUCE A MODEL OFTHE LIFE CYCLE OF A SCIENTIFIC DISCIPLINE, AND SUGGESTS A NUMBER OF FOLLOW-UPSTUDIES.
2533|MEASUREMENT IN INFORMATION SCIENCE' OBJECTIVE AND SUBJECTIVE METRICAL SPACE.     IT IS ARGUED THAT IN INFORMATION SCIENCE WE HAVE TO DISTINGUISH PHYSICAL,OBJECTIVE, OR DOCUMENT SPACE FROM PERSPECTIVE, SUBJECTIVE, OR INFORMATIONSPACE. THESE 2| SPACES ARE LIKE MAPS AND LANDSCAPES' EACH IS A SYSTEMATICDISTORTION OF THE OTHER. HOWEVER, TRANSFORMATIONS CAN BE EASILY MADE ONCE THE2| SPACES ARE DISTINGUISHED.
2534|MYSTERIES OF THE DEEP' MODELS OF THE UNIVERSE OF KNOWLEDGE.     EVIDENCE OF THE USE, BY SCHOLARS AND OTHERS, OF MENTAL CONSTRUCTS OR MODELS OFSPATIAL AND TEMPORAL RELATIONSHIPS IS PRESENTED TO ILLUSTRATE A NON-VERBALKNOWLEDGE STRUCTURE. THE RELATIONSHIP OF THIS KIND OF STRUCTURE TO EFFORTS TOCONSTRUCT MODELS OF THE UNIVERSE OF KNOWLEDGE IS STATED, NOTING THE DANGER INSUCH MODELS.

2536|THE CONCEPTION OF PRIMARY, SECONDARY AND TERTIARY INFORMATION FROM THE POINTOF VIEW OF THE THEORY OF REFLECTION OF SYMBOLS.     USING THE UNIVERSAL MODEL OF TRANSFORMATION OF INFORMATION AND THROUGHSTRUCTURE OF DATA FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF THE THEORY OF REFLECTION, THESIMILARITIES AND DIFFERENCES BETWEEN PRIMARY, SECONDARY AND TERTIARYINFORMATION ARE OUTLINED. ACCORDING TO WHETHER THE SYMBOL IS A REFLECTION OFPHENOMENA OR A REFLECTION OF A SYMBOL (SIGN), VARIOUS ORDERS OF THE REFLECTIONARE RECOGNISED, I.E. THE ORDER OF THE SYMBOL REFLECTION. THUS PRIMARYINFORMATION IS A REFLECTION OF A PHENOMENON DEPOSITED WITHOUT A SIGN/MARK,SECONDARY INFORMATION IS A REFLECTION OF THE DEPOSITED SIGNS, ETC. THESTATEMENT GIVING THE SPACE AND TIME IN WHICH A PHENOMENON IS VALID IS CALLEDTHE ADDRESS.
2537|THE ACADEMIC LIBRARIAN.     THE CAREER OF A LIBRARIAN SHOULD COMBINE THE PRACTICAL SIDE OF LIBRARIANSHIPWITH ACADEMIC KNOWLEDGE AND RESEARCH. NOWADAYS NEW RESEARCH IN LIBRARY SCIENCEIS USUALLY CARRIED OUT IN TEAMS RATHER THAN BY INDIVIDUALS. MODERN LIBRARIANSHAVE TO POSSESS A WIDE RANGE OF KNOWLEDGE COVERING MANY FIELDS AND IT IS NOLONGER USUAL FOR A LIBRARIAN TO BE AN EXPERT IN ONLY 1| SUBJECT. TEACHERS ATLIBRARY SCHOOLS ARE OFTEN PART-TIME LIBRARIANS AND PROVIDE STUDENTS WITH ANUNDERSTANDING OF DAILY LIBRARY ACTIVITY, WHICH PREVENTS COURSES FROM BECOMINGMERELY THEORETICAL. THE CHANGING STRUCTURE OF ACADEMIC LIBRARIES IS REFLECTEDIN THE SYLLABUSES OF LIBRARY SCHOOLS WHICH DEVOTE MORE TIME TO CURRENT LIBRARYAND INFORMATION SCIENCE SUBJECTS THAN BEFORE.
2538|ARCHIVIST AND COMPREHENSIVIST.     RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN TECHNOLOGY HAVE VASTLY EXPANDED THE ARCHIVAL REALM. THEARCHIVIST RISKS BEING OUT OF TUNE WITH THE NEEDS OF ELECTRONIC TIMES. TODAYTHE 'COMPLETE' ARCHIVIST IS REQUIRED TO PLAY AN EVER WIDENINGINTERDISCIPLINARY ROLE. THE SPECIALIST MUST NOW BECOME THE COMPREHENSIVIST WHOCAN USE THE APPROPRIATE HARDWARE WITH ALL HIS WITS AND SENSES.

2542|EVEN AFTER 8| YEARS WITHIN THE COLLEGES OF TECHNOLOGY, LIBRARIANSHIP TRAININGIS STILL A CRISIS AREA.     ALTHOUGH NATIONAL GUIDELINES WERE DRAWN UP ON LIBRARIANSHIP TRAINING, EACHWEST GERMAN STATE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ITS OWN EDUCATION SYSTEM, THEREFORECONSIDERABLE VARIATIONS STILL EXIST CONCERNING LEGAL STATUS OF LIBRARYSCHOOLS, ENTRY REQUIREMENTS, CURRICULA FOR COMPULSORY AND OPTIONAL SUBJECTSAND ORGANISATION OF COURSES FOR PUBLIC AND ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS. SOME SUBJECTSARE NOT TAUGHT AT ALL IN SOME SCHOOLS AND GENERALLY RELATED SUBJECTS ARE SPLITUP TOO MUCH. MANY LECTURERS PLACE TOO MUCH EMPHASIS ON FORMAL LECTURES' MANYSTUDENTS ARE UNINTERESTED IN THEIR STUDIES. TRAINING COURSES MUST DEVELOPSTUDENTS' CRITICAL FACULTIES, ENCOURAGE CREATIVITY AND PROMOTE ACTIVECOMMUNICATION WITH READERS AND COOPERATION WITH OTHER INSTITUTIONS; BETTERORGANISATION AND MORE UNIFICATION AMONG LIBRARY SCHOOLS ARE REQUIRED.
2543|STUDENTS CRITICISE THE SITUATION CONCERNING TRAINING AT STUTTGART LIBRARYSCHOOL.     REPORT OF DISCUSSION AT A WEEKEND SEMINAR, STUTTGART, JAN 81|. MANY STUDENTSHAVE FINANCIAL PROBLEMS AND DIFFICULTIES IN FINDING ACCOMMODATION BUT,COMPARED WITH OTHER COURSES, FEW DROP OUT AND STUDENT-STAFF RELATIONSHIPS AREGOOD. LIBRARIANSHIP STUDIES SHOULD DEVELOP CRITICAL FACULTIES AND THE ABILITYTO MAKE CONTACT WITH READERS. THE LIBRARY MUST BECOME A COMMUNICATION CENTRE,UP TO DATE AND OPEN TO OUTSIDE INFLUENCES. REGIONAL NEEDS SHOULD BE EMPHASISEDRATHER THAN NATIONAL STANDARDISATION. LIBRARIANSHIP COURSES SHOULD CONTAIN NEWFIELDS OF STUDY, LIKE SOCIAL AND COMMUNICATION SCIENCES. SOME FORMAL LECTURESSHOULD BE REPLACED BY SMALL STUDY GROUPS, EXAMINATION PROCEDURES SHOULD BEIMPROVED AND BETTER USE MADE OF PRACTICAL TRAINING PERIODS.
2544|AN EXPERIMENT IN M LIB SC TEACHING.     PRESENTS AN ANALYTICAL VIEW OF THE M LIB SC COURSE WHICH IS BEING OFFERED ATBOMBAY UNIVERSITY. COMPARES THE COURSE CONTENT AND OTHER ASPECTS OF THISCOURSE WITH THOSE AT DELHI UNIVERSITY AND BENARAS HINDU UNIVERSITY. ANALYSESIN DETAIL THE METHOD OF TEACHING, EXAMINATION PATTERN AND OTHER RELATEDASPECTS OF BOMBAY UNIVERSITY AND COMPARES THEM WITH THE OTHER UNIVERSITIESOFFERING M LIB SC COURSES. CONCLUDES THAT THE BOMBAY UNIVERSITY COURSE HASSTARTED A NEW EXPERIMENT WHERE REGULAR CLASSES ARE NOT REQUIRED AND NOFULL-TIME TEACHERS ARE PROVIDED.
2545|ON THE EXTENSION TRAINING OF LIBRARIANS.     SUMMARISES THE OPPORTUNITIES AVAILABLE FOR EXTENSION TRAINING OF LIBRARIANS INHUNGARY SINCE 1963|. APART FROM LECTURES AND COURSES, EXTENSION TRAINING MAYALSO TAKE THE FORM OF STUDY TOURS, THESES FOR DOCTORATES AND INDIVIDUALSTUDIES FOR THE COMPLEMENTARY COLLEGE-LEVEL STATE EXAMINATIONS. DESCRIBES THEDIFFERENT TRAINING ORGANISATIONS AND THE CONTRIBUTION THEY MAKE IN THIS FIELD'THE CENTRE FOR LIBRARY SCIENCE AND METHODOLOGY AT THE NATIONAL SZECHENYILIBRARY (OSZK KMK); SPECIAL LIBRARIES; PUBLIC LIBRARIES; SCHOOL LIBRARIES; ANDTHE ASSOCIATION OF HUNGARIAN LIBRARIANS WHICH HELPS THE DEVELOPMENT OF THEPROFESSION WITH PROFESSIONAL DEBATES AND WITH RESEARCH WORK CARRIED OUT WITHINITS SECTIONS. PROPOSES THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A UNIFORM SYSTEM OF EXTENSIONTRAINING WITHIN THE ACADEMIC INSTITUTIONS AND THE OSZK KMK.
2546|THE APPLICATION OF KNOWLEDGE GAINED DURING SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION AND LIBRARYSTUDIES AT THE PHILOSOPHICAL FACULTY OF CHARLES UNIVERSITY IN INFORMATIONPRACTICE.     THE THEORETICAL KNOWLEDGE GAINED DURING STUDIES IN THE 4|-YEAR LIBRARY ANDINFORMATION COURSE AT THE PHILOSOPHICAL FACULTY OF CHARLES UNIVERSITY INPRAGUE IS COMPARED WITH THE AUTHOR'S 20| YEARS PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE OF WORKINGIN AN INFORMATION CENTRE IN A BRANCH OF THE TEXTILE INDUSTRY. THE DEMANDSPLACED ON THE STUDENT FALL INTO 3| CATEGORIES' KNOWLEDGE OF THE METHODOLOGY ANDTECHNIQUES OF INFORMATION WORK (THE SYLLABUS OF THE SUBJECTS FORMING THEINFORMATION CORE IS PRESENTED IN SOME DETAIL); KNOWLEDGE OF FOREIGN LANGUAGES;SUBJECT KNOWLEDGE (SUBJECT SPECIALISATION). LISTS THE AREAS IN WHICH STUDY OFINFORMATION THEORY HAS HELPED IN PRACTICAL WORK.
2547|WHEN THE LIBRARY SCHOOL WANTS TO ALTER ITS ROAD-MAP.     REACTIONS OF LIBRARIANS TO RECENT PROPOSALS (TAKING ACCOUNT OF THE 1976|-77|REPORTS ON POSSIBLE ELEVATION TO UNIVERSITY STATUS) FOR A NEW CURRICULUM INTHE NORWEGIAN STATE LIBRARY SCHOOL. POINTS COVERED INCLUDE THE PROPOSED 2|-YEARCOMMON COURSE, WITH SPECIALISATION IN THE 3|RD YEAR (GENERALLY APPROVED);METHODS SUBJECTS (BIBLIOGRAPHY IS CONSIDERED NECESSARY, BUT SOME CONSIDERCOMPUTER STUDIES NOWADAYS EQUALLY ESSENTIAL); LITERATURE AND SOCIETY (THOUGHTTO MERIT MORE ATTENTION, ESPECIALLY CHILDREN'S LITERATURE, POPULAR LITERATURE,AND SERVICES TO HANDICAPPED AND IMMIGRANTS); INFORMATION SCIENCE (SHOULD BEINCLUDED IN 2| OR EVEN 3| YEARS); ADMINISTRATION (CONSIDERED ABSOLUTELYESSENTIAL); PRACTICAL TRAINING (SHOULD PROBABLY BE EXTENDED); EVALUATION OFSTUDENTS' WORK (GENERAL OPINION FAVOURS THE RETENTION OF MARKING TOGETHER WITHCONTINUOUS EVALUATION); LECTURING STAFF (LIBRARY EXPERIENCE IS PREFERRED TOACADEMIC SPECIALISATION); INTAKE OF STUD ENTS (AS FAR AS POSSIBLE SHOULD COVERTHE WHOLE COUNTRY). BETTER LIAISON ON EDUCATION BETWEEN SCHOOL AND LIBRARYPROFESSION IS FELT DESIRABLE, BUT THERE SEEMS NO MAJOR DISAGREEMENT BETWEENTHE CURRICULUM COMMITTEE AND LIBRARIANS IN THE FIELD.
2548|THIS ONE-SIDED PRAXIS-WORSHIP.     A NORWEGIAN STATE LIBRARY SCHOOL STUDENT REBUTS 3| CLAIMS MADE BY PREVIOUSWRITERS (SPECIAL SECTION ON LIBRARY EDUCATION IN NORWAY, 2|IBID1| 46| (8|) 1979|;2|SEE1| 81|/60|)' (1|) THAT LECTURERS HAVE TOO LITTLE PRACTICAL LIBRARY EXPERIENCE(&H HAVE EXTENSIVE LIBRARY EXPERIENCE, WHILE THE OTHERS MAINTAIN CONTACT WITHCURRENT LIBRARY PRACTICE); (2|) THAT THE COURSE CONTAINS TOO LITTLE PRACTICALTRAINING (THE NEW 3|-YEAR THEORETICAL CURRICULUM IS A STEP FORWARD.

2578|THE PEOPLE WANT PAP, OR IDEAS FOR AN ALTERNATIVE FORM OF LIBRARY WORK.     A YOUNG LIBRARIAN CHALLENGES HIS COLLEAGUES TO QUESTION THE ATTITUDE THAT THEYHAVE HELD TOWARDS THEIR WORK UNTIL NOW. PUBLIC LIBRARIES ARE AT PRESENT IN ABLIND ALLEY. LIBRARIANS HAVE FORGOTTEN THAT BOOKS ARE NOT SIMPLY THE SOURCESOF CERTAIN IDEAS' THEY ARE ALSO GOODS SUBJECT TO THE LAWS OF MARKETING, HENCETHE PREDOMINANCE OF BEST-SELLERS AND TRIVIAL MATERIAL ON THE MARKET. IT ISWRONG TO VALUE THE ABILITY TO READ ABOVE THAT OF PLAYING FOOTBALL; WHAT ISVITAL IS DISCRIMINATION AND SENSITIVITY TOWARDS THE ACTUAL CONTENTS OF THEMATERIAL READ. LIBRARIANS ARE AFTER ALL RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL THEIR ACTUAL ANDPOTENTIAL READERS, BY WHOM THEIR WORK IS FINANCED.

IN SWEDEN TOO THERE IS A TENDENCY TOWARDS A UNIFIED LIBRARY SYSTEM.INSISTS THAT ALL LIBRARY TYPES SHOULD BE DEMOCRATICALLY CONTROLLED UNDER 1|MINISTRY; THE SEPARATIST ATTITUDE OF RESEARCH LIBRARIES IS THEREFOREREGRETTABLE. LIBRARIES SHOULD DEFINE THEIR USERS MORE BROADLY, NOW THAT THEEDUCATIONAL LEVEL OF THE POPULATION HAS RISEN AND USERS NEED MATERIAL AT ALLLEVELS. ECONOMIC CUTS NECESSITATE A UNIFIED SYSTEM TO DISTRIBUTE RESOURCES.USE OF THE NEW INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN LIBRARIES IS A QUESTION OF THESURVIVAL OF THE DEMOCRATIC LIBRARY, IT CAN REVOLUTIONISE RURAL LIFE AN DEDUCATION.

MOST STATE LIBRARY CENTRES, EXCEPT THOSE IN BAVARIA, NOW HAVE TO FACEFINANCIAL RESTRICTIONS, JUST AT A TIME WHEN INCREASES IN STOCKS AND SERVICESARE BADLY NEEDED. EVERYTHING THAT LIBRARY CENTRES HOPED FOR SEEMS THREATENED.THE GERMAN TENDENCY TOWARDS PERFECTION APPLIES TO MEDIUM-SIZED RATHER THAN TOSMALL ORGANISATIONS. THE INCREASED USE OF NON-BOOK MEDIA HAS CHANGED THECENTRES' ROLE. THE CENTRES HAVE PLAYED AN INVALUABLE PART IN DEVELOPING RURALLIBRARY SERVICES BUT THEIR GOLDEN AGE IS NOW PAST. LIBRARY POLICY COULD BEALTERED, HOWEVER, THROUGH THE PERFORMANCE OF THE CENTRES' TASKS BY REGIONALLIBRARY ASSOCIATIONS. THESE ASSOCIATIONS SHOULD BE FORMED IN AREAS WHERE NONEEXIST; BASED ON A CONSTITUTION WORKED OUT BY LOCAL POLITICIANS, THEY CAN WORKTOWARDS IMPROVING SERVICE QUALITY.

DESCRIBESTECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS IN THE VIDEO FIELD, WHICH ARE LIKELY TO LEAD TO ANABUNDANCE OF PICTURES COMPETING ON OUR TV SCREENS. THIS SITUATION HAS BOTHPROBLEMS AND POSSIBILITIES. THE OUTPUT OF VIDEO CASSETTES CONSISTS MAINLY OFLOW QUALITY ACTION FILMS AND THE DELAY IN THE PLANS FOR DISTRIBUTION OFSWEDISH TV PROGRAMMES, WHICH SHOULD HEIGHTEN THE QUALITY, IS REGRETTABLE. BUTTHE NEW DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM ALSO OFFERS NEW FREEDOM OF CHOICE AND INDEPENDENCEOF TRANSMISSION TIMES. VIDEO TECHNIQUES ARE USEFUL FOR MINORITIES SUCH AS THEDEAF AND IMMIGRANTS. THE VIDEOGRAM COMMISSION THEREFORE RECOMMENDS THATLIBRARIES SHOULD SHOW VIDEO FILMS, LEND THEM AND TRANSMIT THEM VIA CABLE.
2657|THE PUBLIC LIBRARY AS PROVIDER OF VIDEO.     DESCRIBES THE AVAILABILITY OF VIDEOTAPES AND EQUIPMENT IN DANISH PUBLICLIBRARIES. THIS AMOUNTED IN 1977| TO 5| LIBRARIES. MOST OF THE PROGRAMMES ARELOCALLY PRODUCED BY AMATEUR GROUPS FOR EDUCATIONAL AND LOCAL HISTORICALPURPOSES. ONLY 1| LIBRARY HAS TAKEN UP THE OFFER OF DEPOSIT OF VIDEO CASSETTESFROM THE STATE FILM CENTRE. REFERS TO VARIOUS REPORTS WHICH MAKE IT CLEAR THATVIDEO IS A MATERIAL WHICH PROPERLY BELONGS IN A PUBLIC LIBRARY AND CAN BEACQUIRED WITH PUBLIC MONEY. THE DESIRABILITY OF HAVING RADIO AND TV PROGRAMMESAVAILABLE FOR LOAN IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES HAS OFTEN BEEN POINTED OUT, BUT THISWOULD NECESSITATE CHANGES IN THE COPYRIGHT ACT OR DIRECT NEGOTIATION BY THELIBRARIES WITH THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS. ARCHIVES FOR RADIO AND TV PRODUCTIONSSHOULD BE SET UP AND THE LAW ON LEGAL DEPOSITS EXPANDED TO INCLUDE NON-BOOKMATERIAL. COOPERATION WITHIN THE NORDIC COUNCIL IS URGED, AND EXPERIMENTS INSELECTED LIBRARIES ARE RECOMMENDED.
2658|THE VIDEO MEDIUM AND THE LIBRARIES' FUTURE PROVISION OF PICTURES.     DESCRIBES THE GROWTH OF VIDEO FILMS. CALLS FOR A FORUM OF LIBRARIANS WHO CANINITIATE PILOT PROJECTS AND EXAMINE DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF VIDEO IN RELATION TOLIBRARIES. AS THIS MEDIUM IS CONSIDERABLY CHEAPER TO PRODUCE AND DISTRIBUTETHAN FILMS, IT IS IMPORTANT THAT LIBRARIES COOPERATE WITH OTHER CULTURALINSTITUTIONS IN SECURING A QUALITY PRODUCTION TO COUNTERACT THE PRESENT LOWQUALITY OUTPUT. THE MEDIUM ALSO RAISES THE POSSIBILITY OF LIBRARIESESTABLISHING WORKSHOPS WHERE EVERYONE CAN USE EQUIPMENT FOR VIDEO PRODUCTION.DESCRIBES A PROJECT LIBRARY AND VIDEO IN HVIDOVRE PUBLIC LIBRARIES, IN APR 80|.VIDEO PROGRAMMES WERE AVAILABLE THROUGH THE LIBRARY'S VIDEO COLLECTION ANDTHROUGH A VIDEO WORKSHOP, IN WHICH THE PUBLIC WERE ENCOURAGED TO EXPERIMENTWITH THE EQUIPMENT THEMSELVES.

2665|REQUIREMENTS AND SUPPLY OF LITERATURE IN PHARMACEUTICAL TRAINING.     IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO DRAW A LINE BETWEEN THE TRAINING OF PHARMACISTS AND OTHERNATURAL SCIENCE TRAINING. IT IS QUESTIONABLE WHAT THE PURPOSE OF TRAININGACTUALLY IS, BUT IT IS OBVIOUS THAT PHARMACISTS MUST BE TRAINED TO PRACTISEIMMEDIATELY IN A PHARMACY, AT A SICK-BED, IN A RESEARCH INSTITUTE OR APHARMACEUTICAL FACTORY. THOSE INVOLVED IN TRAINING NEED SPECIALIST BOOKS ANDJOURNALS. IN HUNGARY, THESE CAN BE PURCHASED BY EVERYBODY, ALTHOUGH PURCHASEOF FOREIGN MATERIALS MAY BE FINANCIALLY DIFFICULT. LIBRARY BUDGETS SHOULDPERMIT THE PURCHASE OF EXPENSIVE BIBLIOGRAPHIES AND ABSTRACTING JOURNALS, ANDREFERENCE BOOKS, LIBRARIANS INSISTING ON THEIR CONTINUOUS ACQUISITION.FINANCIAL PROBLEMS MAY BE SOLVED BY BUDGETS WHICH FOLLOW PROPORTIONAL PRICEINCREASE, AND BY GOVERNMENTS WILLING TO REDUCE IMPORT PROFIT RATES OFMATERIALS FOR EDUCATION, RESEARCH AND MEDICAL TREATMENT. LIBRARIANS SHOULD BEWELL ACQUAINTED WITH THE TERMINOLOGY, TRAINING SYSTEM AND LITERATURE OF THEIRFIELD, AND BE QUALIFIED TO INTRODUCE READERS TO INTELLECTUAL WORK.

2669|DEICHMAN LIBRARY AND SERIES BOOKS FOR CHILDREN.     IN SPRING 79| DEICHMAN LIBRARY, OSLO, STOPPED BUYING CHILDREN'S SERIES BOOKSAND DISCARDED WORN-OUT STOCK COPIES. THEY WERE SURPRISED BY HOSTILE PUBLICREACTION (A SELECTION OF READERS' LETTERS TO OSLO NEWSPAPERS IS APPENDED),HAVING REGARDED THE MOVE AS CORRECTING A LONG-STANDING MISTAKE. SINCE THEMID-60|S DEICHMAN HAD BOUGHT A FEW COPIES OF 2|HARDY BOYS1| AND SIMILAR TITLES,RECOGNISED AS SUB-STANDARD LITERATURE, BUT INTENDED TO LEAD CHILDREN TO BETTERBOOKS AND INCREASE THE THEN INADEQUATE SELECTION OF CHILDREN'S LITERATURE.

2671|THE ADMINISTRATION OF A SMALLER PUBLIC LIBRARY AUTHORITY AND THE ORGANISATIONOF THE COUNTY LIBRARY SYSTEM.     IN THE NETHERLANDS LOCAL AUTHORITIES WITH LESS THAN 30|,000| INHABITANTS MAYORGANISE THEIR OWN LIBRARY SERVICE. HOWEVER, THEY ARE REQUIRED BY THE DUTCHPUBLIC LIBRARIES ACT TO WORK IN CLOSE COOPERATION WITH THE COUNTY LIBRARYNETWORK. LIBRARY COMMITTEES IN THESE AREAS SHOULD INCLUDE A REPRESENTATIVECROSS-SECTION OF THE SOCIAL AND CULTURAL LIFE OF THE COMMUNITY. COMMITTEEMEMBERS WITH LOCAL CONNECTIONS ARE MORE LIKELY TO UNDERSTAND THE CIRCUMSTANCESOF THE AREA. HOWEVER, WHERE THE LOCAL LIBRARY COMMITTEE INSISTS ON FOLLOWINGITS OWN POLICIES, THE COUNTY LIBRARY SYSTEM MAY BE PREVENTED FROM PURSUING ACOORDINATED POLICY FOR ALL LIBRARIES THROUGHOUT ITS REGION. THE INTERESTS OFTHE LOCAL COMMUNITY CAN BE SERVED BY THE CREATION OF LIBRARY USERS' COMMITTEESIN EACH AREA.

2677|THE LIBRARY WITHIN THE COOPERATION BETWEEN TWIN TOWNS.     THE IMPORTANCE OF TWINNING ARRANGEMENTS BETWEEN NORDIC TOWNS FOR THEFURTHERANCE OF NORDIC CULTURE IS RECOGNISED, BUT THE ROLE OF LIBRARIES IN THISCOOPERATION IS NOT CLEAR. THE LIBRARY IS THE NATURAL POINT FOR COLLECTION OFMATERIAL ABOUT THE TWIN TOWNS AND FOR THE TRANSFER OF MATERIAL FROM THE HOMETOWN TO THE TWIN TOWNS. IT SHOULD ENCOURAGE READING OF THE NEIGHBOURINGCOUNTRIES' LITERATURE. DESCRIBES THE EXCHANGE AGREEMENTS BETWEEN JAMTLANDREGIONAL LIBRARY IN SWEDEN, AND SOUTH TRONDELAG LIBRARY ASSOCIATION AND THEREGIONAL LIBRARY IN TRONDHEIM, NORWAY.

2683|TOWARDS AN ALTERNATIVE REGIONAL APPROACH TO LIBRARIES.     IN THE NETHERLANDS A CHANGE IN GOVERNMENT POLICY TOWARDS THE PROVISION OFREGIONAL LIBRARY SERVICES IS NOW BECOMING APPARENT. IN THE GOVERNMENT'S VIEWTHE INCREASING AVAILABILITY OF ON-LINE INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SERVICES WILLNECESSITATE THE CREATION OF A NETWORK OF WELL-STOCKED LIBRARIES IN EACHREGION. IN ORDER TO FINANCE SUCH A POLICY WHILST LOCAL AUTHORITIES ARESUFFERING SEVERE ECONOMIC RESTRAINTS, THE GOVERNMENT HAS SUGGESTED THAT LESSATTENTION SHOULD BE GIVEN TO THE RECREATIONAL FUNCTION OF PUBLIC LIBRARIES. INADDITION, RESEARCH BY THE BIBLIOTHEEKRAAD (LIBRARY ADVISORY COUNCIL) INTOINTERLIBRARY LENDING IN THE NETHERLANDS HAS SHOWN THAT THERE IS INSUFFICIENTCOOPERATION ON ACQUISITION POLICIES AMONGST THE LIBRARIES OF EACH REGION. INORDER TO BRING LIBRARIES TOGETHER IN CLOSER COOPERATION IT WILL BE NECESSARYTO OVERCOME THE RESISTANCE OF INDIVIDUAL LIBRARIANS AND TO CHANGE THE PRESENTLAW RELATING TO PUBLIC LIBRARIES.
2684|POLITICAL SETTING OF LIBRARIES IN POST-SECONDARY INSTITUTIONS.

2685|THE INVISIBLE LIBRARY.     ARGUES THAT THE NEGLECT OF PR ACTIVITIES BY PUBLIC LIBRARIES HAS LED TO ANINCREASING LACK OF UNDERSTANDING OF THEIR BASIC AIMS AMONG POLITICIANS AND ACONSEQUENT REDUCTION IN THEIR BUDGETS. THE LIBRARY SERVICE OCCUPIES A MODESTPLACE IN THE PUBLIC DEBATE COMPARED TO OTHER SECTORS BECAUSE IT HAS NOCOMPETITORS AND THE PUBLIC LACKS A BASIS FOR COMPARISON. LIBRARY MATTERS GETLITTLE PUBLICITY EITHER IN THE NATIONAL, LOCAL OR PROFESSIONAL PRESS. ACTIONSBY USER GROUPS, ESPECIALLY IF THESE ARE GENERALLY RESPECTED CITIZENS, CAN BEVERY EFFECTIVE AND CONTACT WITH ORGANISATIONS SUCH AS THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCEAND THE TRADE UNIONS SHOULD BE NURTURED BY THE LIBRARY. THIS COULD TAKE THEFORM OF 'FRIENDS OF THE LIBRARY GROUPS, AS FOUND LARGELY IN THE USA, OR, MOREIN LINE WITH DANISH PRACTICE, USER COUNCILS.

THEPROPOSAL FOR A NEW LIBRARY LAW WILL BE PRESENTED TO PARLIAMENT IN THEBEGINNING OF THE SESSION 1981|-82|, AND IT IS HOPED TO GET BROAD PARTY SUPPORTFOR IT. THE PROPOSAL SUGGESTS, NOT A JOINT DIRECTORATE, BUT LIBRARY MANAGEMENTWITH AN ADMINISTRATIVE LEADER RESPONSIBLE FOR TASKS COMMON TO PUBLIC ANDRESEARCH LIBRARIES AND INTERLENDING SERVICES. WOULD PREFER SCHOOL LIBRARIES TOBELONG UNDER THE EDUCATION MINISTRY, BUT THEY SHOULD CATER FOR LEISURE READINGAS WELL AS PROVIDING EDUCATIONAL RESOURCE MATERIAL. LIBRARIANS SHOULD BE LEFTTO FULFIL THE OBLIGATION OF COMPREHENSIVENESS IN BOOK SELECTION, AND LOCALPOLITICIANS SHOULD NOT EXERCISE ANY FORM OF CENSORSHIP PRIOR TO SELECTION.STANDS FIRM ON THE PRINCIPLE OF NO CHARGE FOR ANY LIBRARY SERVICES. LIBRAR IESCANNOT BE IMMUNE FROM CUTS AND THE SAVINGS CIRCULAR WAS AN ATTEMPT TO RETAINTHE LEVEL OF SERVICES WHILE LOWERING THE RATE OF INCREASE.

2696|INTERIM REPORT WITH MAJOR CONSEQUENCES FOR LIBRARIES.     THE LATEST INTERIM REPORT FROM THE NORWEGIAN JUEL COMMITTEE ON LOCALGOVERNMENT REFORM, 2|NEW FINANCE SYSTEM FOR COUNTY AUTHORITIES1|, COULDSERIOUSLY AFFECT PUBLIC LIBRARIES. IF ITS PROPOSALS ARE IMPLEMENTED, FINANCIALARRANGEMENTS BETWEEN STATE, COUNTY AND MUNICIPAL AUTHORITIES WILL BEABOLISHED, AND STATE SUBSIDIES GIVEN ONLY WHERE ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL. STATESUPPORT OF LIBRARIES AND CULTURAL ACTIVITIES IS CONSIDERED NEITHER DESIRABLENOR NECESSARY. THE STATE LIBRARY OFFICE, IN REPLY, CONSIDERS THE PRESENT STATEGRANTS VITAL IN OPERATING A SATISFACTORY LIBRARY SERVICE ACCORDING TO THELIBRARY ACT. LOCAL AUTHORITIES ARE NOT LEGALLY OBLIGED TO ADMINISTER COUNTYLIBRARIES; WITHOUT STATE SUPPORT, LIBRARIES MIGHT RECEIVE ONLY MINIMAL SUMS,LEADING AT WORST TO THE CLOSURE OF COUNTY LIBRARY SERVICES IN SOME COUNTIES.SINCE PUBLIC AND MOBILE LIBRARIES ARE NOWADAYS CLOSELY LINKED TO COUNTYLIBRARIES, THIS WOULD SERIOUSLY DAMAGE THE PROVISION OF  AN ADEQUATE NATIONALLIBRARY SERVICE.
2697|WILL THE STATE TAKE THE FINANCIAL BACKBONE OUT OF THE LIBRARY ACT?.     STATE GRANTS TO THE VEST-AGDER (NORWAY) COUNTY LIBRARY AMOUNTED IN 1980| TO 35|%OF ITS BUDGET. RECENT PROPOSALS BY THE JUEL COMMITTEE ON LOCAL GOVERNMENTREFORM WOULD MEAN THE WITHDRAWAL OF STATE SUPPORT. IF RESPONSIBILITY FORLIBRARY SERVICE DEVOLVES ENTIRELY ON LOCAL AUTHORITIES, THE NORWEGIAN PUBLICLIBRARY SYSTEM WILL BE THREATENED BY DISINTEGRATION, WITH NATIONAL LIBRARYDUTIES CONCENTRATED IN A FEW STATE-OWNED SPECIAL LIBRARIES. SINCE EVEN THEREVISED LIBRARY ACT OF 1971| DID NOT OBLIGE COUNTIES TO OPERATE A LIBRARYSERVICE, THE SYSTEM HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED AND DEVELOPED LARGELY THROUGH THEINFLUENCE AND SUPPORT OF CENTRAL AUTHORITY. THE BASIS FOR THE 1971| ACT WAS THELONG-STANDING REGIONAL IMBALANCE IN SCHOOL LIBRARY AND PUBLIC LIBRARYSTANDARDS. UNDER THE NEW PROPOSALS, LIBRARIES IN THE MOST DEPRIVED AREAS WOULDBE IN MOST DANGER, AND CULTURAL ACTIVITY AS A WHOLE WOULD BE VULNERABLE TOPOLITICAL MOTIVATION.

OUTLINES THE FEATURES AND CAPABILITIES OF FACSIMILE TRANSMISSION EQUIPMENT ANDIDENTIFIES SOME DEVELOPMENTS NEEDED TO MAKE THE EQUIPMENT'S USE ECONOMIC INLIBRARIES (FLAT-BED MACHINES WITH STAFF-SAVING DEVICES, CONSIDERABLE DROP INPRICE, AND BASING OF COMMUNICATION COSTS ON USE RATHER THAN DISTANCE).
2703|INTEGRATING MICROGRAPHICS WITH WORD PROCESSING.     IN 1974|, THE CONGRESSIONAL RESEARCH SERVICE (CRS) INSTALLED A WORD PROCESSING(WP) SYSTEM TO MEET EXPANDING CONGRESSIONAL NEEDS. THE WP SYSTEM INCREASEDOUTPUT, STRAINING THE ABILITY OF CRS TO HANDLE ITS STORAGE NEEDS. PAPER WASUSED FOR QUICK DISTRIBUTION OF EYE-READABLE MATERIALS, MAGNETIC TAPE FOR QUICKRETRIEVAL OF MACHINE-READABLE STORAGE, AND MICROFORM FOR LONG-TERM STORAGE.MAINTAINING COMPATIBILITY AMONG THE 3| STORAGE SYSTEMS BECAME A FORMIDABLETASK, AND THE SOLUTION SEEMED TO BE TO INTEGRATE STORAGE TO 1| MEDIUM.MICROFORMS OFFERED THE MOST EFFECTIVE METHOD OF MEETING THE TOTAL STORAGEREQUIREMENTS.

2706|OF MEN AND MACHINES.     DISCUSSES THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE COMPUTER AND ITS APPLICATION TOLIBRARIES WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO INDIA. CONCLUDES THAT BEFORE COMPUTERS AREINSTALLED IN LIBRARIES, FEASIBILITY STUDIES AND SURVEYS SHOULD BE CONDUCTED TOFIND OUT THE ENVIRONMENTAL, CULTURAL AND ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL ASPECTS. REVEALSTHAT OTHER ASPECTS OF MECHANISATION HAVE A GREATER IMPACT THAN COMPUTERISATIONALONE.
2707|LIBRARIES AND COMPUTERS.     THE DEBATE ON COMPUTERS IN LIBRARIES CENTRES AROUND 2| QUESTIONS' WHETHERCOMPUTERS ON THE WHOLE ARE OF BENEFIT TO USERS, AND WHETHER THE BUMS SYSTEM INPARTICULAR IS OF VALUE. INTRODUCTION OF COMPUTERS MEANS THAT LIBRARY STAFFBECOME DEPENDENT ON EXPERTS. AS PROCESSES BECOME AUTOMATED THEY ALSO BECOMEDEHUMANISED, AND READERS USE MACHINES DIRECTLY WITH MINIMAL HELP FROM STAFF.SOME SKILLS ARE LOST AND REPLACED WITH ROUTINES. AS FOR THE BUMS SYSTEM, SOMEROUTINES HAVE MERELY REPLACED OTHERS. A TRADITIONAL CARD CATALOGUE IS EASIERTO USE THAN THE BUMS CATALOGUE, ALTHOUGH THE LATTER MAKES SURVEY OF THELIBRARY'S TOTAL STOCK POSSIBLE. BUT THIS LEADS IN TURN TO INCREASE IN THENUMBER OF REQUESTS WITHIN THE LIBRARY SYSTEM; IT FAVOURS THE ACTIVE,EXPERIENCED USERS, BUT DISCOURAGES THE INEXPERIENCED AND THE BROWSERS. THECOST OF GATHERING OF STATISTICS THROUGH THROUGH BUMS AND TRAINING OF STAFF INDATA TECHNOLOGY MUST BE SET AGAINST OTHER POSSIBLE USES OF THE RESOURCES.
2708|AS AMERICAN AS HAMBURGERS AND APPLE PIE.     SUMS UP THE IMPRESSIONS OF AUTOMATION IN US LIBRARIES. MOST LARGER LIBRARYSYSTEMS HAVE NOW AUTOMATED THEIR TECHNICAL PROCESSES, BUT AUTOMATION OF THEMORE COMPLICATED BIBLIOGRAPHIC ROUTINES, SUCH AS LITERATURE SEARCHING WHICHNECESSITATE UNIFORM AND WELL DEVELOPED CATALOGUING, IS NOT WIDESPREAD. THEPROCESS OF AUTOMATION STARTED IN THE 60|S SPURRED LARGELY BY THE GENERAL USOPENNESS TOWARDS TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENTS AND PRESSURE FROM COMMERCIALFIRMS. THE LACK OF INTERLIBRARY COOPERATION AND OF STANDARDISATION OF WORKROUTINES IN US PUBLIC LIBRARIES HAS ENCOURAGED THE ADOPTION OF AUTOMATIONSYSTEMS TAILOR-MADE TO INDIVIDUAL LIBRARIES. THE GENERAL IMPACT OF AUTOMATIONHAS NOT BEEN MUCH STUDIED, BUT THERE WAS AGREEMENT THAT COMPUTER TECHNOLOGYHAD LED TO CENTRALISATION, LESS INDEPENDENCE FOR BRANCHES, BETTERINTERLENDING, AND HAD FREED RESOURCES FOR OTHER SERVICES. ALTHOUGH FEWER STAFFTENDED TO BE EMPLOYED, NONE HAD BEEN DIRECTLY MADE REDUNDANT. NO COST-BENEFITANALYSES SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN CARRIED OUT. THE REACTIONS OF USERS, BOTH STAFFAND READERS, WERE LARGELY FAVOURABLE, EXCEPT PERHAPS IN BRANCH PUBLICLIBRARIES.
2709|A SURVEY OF THE STATUS OF ACADEMIC LIBRARY AUTOMATION IN LOUISIANA.     A SURVEY ON THE EXTENT OF LIBRARY AUTOMATION IN ACADEMIC LIBRARIES INLOUISIANA WAS UNDERTAKEN.

REPORTNOT AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
2710|PLANNING FOR NEW INFORMATION SYSTEMS.     LOW COST COMPUTING HARDWARE WITH INCREASINGLY SOPHISTICATED SOFTWARE ISPROVIDING OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW, OR THE REVISION OFEXISTING, INFORMATION SYSTEMS. THE PROCEDURES WHICH ARE INVOLVED IN THEPLANNING STAGE OF SUCH SYSTEMS HAVE BEEN INFLUENCED BY THE COSTS INVOLVED ANDTHE DECISION MAKING IS MORE IN THE HANDS OF THE DEPARTMENT OR UNIT WITHIN ANORGANISATION THAN IT WAS. A STAGED PROCEDURE WITH A CHECKLIST OF ACTIVITIES,APPROPRIATE DOCUMENTATION AND CONSIDERATIONS TO BE TAKEN AT EACH STAGE IS 1|WAY TO REDUCE THE CHANCES OF ERROR IN THE DECISIONS MADE IN THE PLANNINGPROCESS.
2711|THE PUBLIC LIBRARY AS PROMOTER OF TECHNO-FASCISM' THE (ANTI-)SOCIALCONSEQUENCES OF AUTOMATION.     MODERN SOCIETY IS DOMINATED BY SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY. HOWEVER, INSUFFICIENTATTENTION HAS BEEN PAID TO THE SOCIAL IMPLICATIONS OF AUTOMATION. THEPROFESSIONAL ORGANISATIONS OF LIBRARIANSHIP IN THE NETHERLANDS HAVE UNDERTAKENNO STUDIES OF THE SOCIAL IMPLICATIONS ON THEIR MEMBERS' BEHALF APART FROM THENETHERLANDS BIBLIOTHEEK EN LEKTUUR CENTRUM (DUTCH CENTRE FOR LIBRARIES ANDLITERATURE), WHICH IN 1979| FORMED A COMMITTEE TO INVESTIGATE WAYS OFPROTECTING THE PRIVACY OF THE INDIVIDUAL AGAINST THE MISUSE OF PERSONALINFORMATION IN COMPUTERISED SYSTEMS. HOWEVER, THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THECOMMITTEE WERE REJECTED IN 1980| BY NBLC MEMBERS AS TOO RADICAL. AUTOMATIONWILL LEAD TO A REDUCTION IN THE NUMBER OF POSTS IN LIBRARIES AT ALL LEVELS ANDLIBRARIANS MUST ACT NOW TO PREVENT A FURTHER DETERIORATION IN THE SITUATION.
2712|MINICOMPUTERS AND AVAILABLE PACKAGES.     DEVELOPMENTS IN THE COMPUTER FIELD IN RECENT YEARS ARE DESCRIBED WITHPARTICULAR EMPHASIS ON THE FACILITIES AVAILABLE FOR THE MECHANISATION OFLIBRARY AND INFORMATION TASKS. WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF MINICOMPUTERS A NEW ERAOPENED UP FOR INFORMATION WORKERS BUT A MAJOR PROBLEM HAD TO BE OVERCOME,NAMELY THE LACK OF SUITABLE SOFTWARE TO PROVIDE THOSE FACILITIES. FOLLOWINGTHE INTRODUCTION OF IBM'S STAIRS PROGRAM FOR INFORMATION STORAGE AND RETRIEVALON A LARGE MAINFRAME COMPUTER, SIMILAR PROGRAMS SOON BECAME AVAILABLE FOR USEON THE RANGE OF MINICOMPUTERS WHICH HAD STARTED TO PENETRATE THE MARKET. MANYWERE SPECIALLY COMMISSIONED FOR LIBRARY AND INFORMATION USE; DISCUSSES CAIRSAND STATUS. A MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH CAME WITH THE INTRODUCTION OF WORDPROCESSORS, PARTICULARLY THE PROGRAMMABLE SHARED LOGIC SYSTEMS.

THE 1|ST AND FOREMOST TASK OF LIBRARIANS IN BULGARIA IS TO EDUCATE THEIRREADERS AND TO EXERCISE INFLUENCE ON THEIR READING HABITS. TO BE CAPABLE OFPERFORMING THE JOB SUCCESSFULLY, LIBRARIANS MUST ACQUIRE A WORKING KNOWLEDGEOF SOCIOLOGY, PSYCHOLOGY AND PEDAGOGY. THUS, THEY WILL NOT ONLY SEE EACHREADER AS AN INDIVIDUAL WITH HIS/HER OWN FAMILY AND EDUCATIONAL BACKGROUND,PERSONAL QUALITIES, AND PROFESSIONAL REQUIREMENTS, BUT THEY WILL ALSO BE ABLETO MAKE THE BEST OF A LEADER'S AUTHORITY IN A GROUP. EDUCATION OF CHILDREN ANDADOLESCENTS HAS BENEFITTED FROM COLLABORATION BETWEEN TEACHERS AND LIBRARIANSAND THE EXPERIENCE GAINED MUST NOW BE USED MORE FULLY IN ADULT EDUCATION.

2739|HOW TO INCREASE THE EFFICIENCY OF THE READERS' WORK IN THE LIBRARY.     AN IMPORTANT TASK OF THE 5|-YEAR-PLAN IS TO SAVE READERS' EXPENDITURE OF EFFORTIN USING LIBRARIES. COMPUTERISED CATALOGUES SHOW WIDE POTENTIAL. READERS'REQUESTS ARE TRANSMITTED TO LARGE LIBRARIES' BOOKSTORES ALONG T.V.COMMUNICATION CHANNELS. DOCUMENT REPRODUCTION HAS SIGNIFICANTLY LESSENEDREADERS' EXPENDITURE OF EFFORT. AUTOMATION OF ACQUISITIONING, CATALOGUING,INTERLIBRARY LOANS, SELECTIVE RETRIEVAL ALSO SAVE READERS' TIME. LARGELIBRARIES HAVE AUTOMATED SYSTEMS FOR ISSUING BIBLIOGRAPHIES, ABSTRACTS, UNIONCATALOGUES. LARGE INFORMATION-COMPUTER CENTRES WILL BE CREATED FOR COLLECTIVEUSE AS INFORMATION TRANSMISSION SYSTEMS. THE STATE AUTOMATED SCIENTIFIC ANDTECHNICAL INFORMATION SYSTEM SHOULD ECONOMISE ON LIBRARIANS' AND READERS'TIME' THE GOVERNING FACTORS IN LIBRARY AUTOMATION.

2811|JOURNALS IN LIBRARIES.     THERE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN PROBLEMS CONNECTED WITH JOURNAL COLLECTIONS INLIBRARIES. COLLECTIONS WERE OFTEN INCOMPLETE, UNSUITABLY STORED AND OFTENIMPOSSIBLE TO LOCATE OWING TO INCOMPLETE CATALOGUING. 1| IMPROVEMENT WAS THEINTRODUCTION OF MICROFILM WHICH WAS EASIER TO STORE AND MEANT THAT ORIGINALJOURNAL COPIES COULD BE STORED IN THE ARCHIVES AND NOT DAMAGED BY CONTINUALUSE. THE ASSOCIATION OF GERMAN LIBRARIANS' COMMISSION FOR JOURNALS HASPUBLISHED IMPORTANT MATERIAL DEALING WITH THE BEST WAYS OF STORING ANDCATALOGUING JOURNAL COLLECTIONS AND COOPERATIVE FILMING WITH OTHER LIBRARIES.AN IMPORTANT AID TO LOCATING JOURNALS IS GERD HAGELWEIDE'S LOCATION CATALOGUEDEUTSCHE ZEITUNGSBESTANDE IN BIBLIOTHEKEN UND ARCHIVEN (GERMAN JOURNALCOLLECTIONS IN LIBRARIES AND ARCHIVES). THE PUBLICATION OF REGIONAL JOURNALCATALOGUES IN WESTPHALIA, BERLIN, HESSE AND WURTEMBERG HAS HELPED TO IMPROVELENDING SYSTEMS IN THESE AREAS.
2812|BIBLIOGRAPHIC CONTROL OF MICROFORMS' SUGGESTIONS FOR IMPROVED LOCAL ACCESS.     PROVIDING COMPLETE ANALYTICS FOR MICROFORM COLLECTIONS IS MORE THE IDEALRATHER THAN THE REALITY FOR MOST LIBRARIES. EVEN WITH PARTIALLY ANALYSEDCOLLECTIONS, HOWEVER, LIBRARIES CAN IMPROVE ACCESS AND PUBLICISE THE EXTENT OFTHEIR HOLDINGS THROUGH A NUMBER OF BIBLIOGRAPHIC AIDS. THESE AIDS INCLUDELABELLING MICROFORM BIBLIOGRAPHIES, PLACING PLASTIC OVERLAYS ON CATALOGUECARDS, ANNOTATING SHORT TITLE CATALOGUES, AND COMPILING GUIDEBOOKS TO MAJORMICROFORM COLLECTIONS.

DISCUSSES THE REASONS BEHIND THE SUSPENSION OF THE PROJECTED NETWORK INLOMBARDY, BEGUN IN 1975| AND DISRUPTED IN 1977|. DETAILS ARE GIVEN OF THESTRUCTURE OF THE SYSTEM DRAWN UP BY THE REGIONAL ADMINISTRATION, THEORGANISATION AND OPERATION OF EXISTING LIBRARIES AS INFORMATION ANDCATALOGUING CENTRES, AND THE TECHNICAL EQUIPMENT INTRODUCED. WITH THE CHANGEOF GOVERNMENT IN 1977|, THE PROJECT WAS SUSPENDED FOR RE-EVALUATION, AND UP TO1980| NO DECISION HAD BEEN REACHED. THE INHERENT DEFECTS OF THE SYSTEM AREANALYSED, TO SHOW HOW THE REGIONAL ADMINISTRATION MADE A FUNDAMENTAL ERROR INESTABLISHING A DECENTRALISED SYSTEM WITHOUT OVERHAULING EXISTING SERVICES TOENSURE ADEQUATE COOPERATION BETWEEN CATALOGUING CENTRES. THE IMMEDIATE CAUSESOF SUSPENSION WERE INCOMPATABILITY OF THE AUTOMATED SYSTEM CHOSEN WITH MARC,AND FAILURE OF INDIVIDUAL LIBRARIES TO MAINTAIN ROUTINE CATALOGUINGACTIVITIES. EMPH ASISES THE NECESSITY FOR BASIC REORGANISATION OF NATIONALLIBRARY SERVICES PRIOR TO SCHEMES FOR AUTOMATION AND COOPERATION.

2888|DEWEY' THE NEGLECTED INTRODUCTION.     DEWEY'S INTRODUCTION HAS BEEN DROPPED FROM THE CURRENT 19|TH EDITION OF THECLASSIFICATION SCHEME. PERHAPS BECAUSE OF ITS ALLEGEDLY PHONETIC SPELLING ITHAS BEEN NEGLECTED. HOWEVER, SINCE IT IS CONSIDERED THAT THIS INTRODUCTIONSAYS EVERYTHING WHICH CAN BE SAID ABOUT LIBRARY CLASSIFICATION IT ISCONSIDERED THAT IT SHOULD NOT NOW BE FORGOTTEN. HOWEVER THE FAILURE TO RELATETHE THEORY IN THE INTRODUCTION TO THE ACTUAL ARRANGEMENT OF THE SUBJECTSWITHIN THE SCHEDULES SET THE UNFORTUNATE PATTERN BY WHICH LIBRARYCLASSIFICATION CAME TO BE DISCUSSED WITH LITTLE OR NO REFERENCE TO THE SUBJECTMATTER INVOLVED. THE FACT THAT DEWEY SURVIVES AS THE MOST WIDELY USEDCLASSIFICATION REFLECTS THE PHYSICAL DIFFICULTY OF TRYING TO RECLASSIFY ANYESTABLISHED LIBRARY AND THE LACK OF ANY NEW THINKING IN EDUCATIONAL CURRICULA.THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT LATER SCHEMES REPRESENT ANY WORTHWHILE ADVANCE ONDEWEY.

WHEN DEVELOPING ON-LINE RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS, THE SPEED OF RESPONSE TO INQUIRIESIS ONE OF THE MAIN CHARACTERISTICS OF THE SYSTEM'S QUALITY. CONSIDERS ACOMPONENT OF RESPONSE TIME-THE DESCRIPTOR RETRIEVAL TIME. DISCUSSES DIRECT,INVERSE, AND COMBINED PATTERNS OF FILE ORGANISATION, MAKES A COMPARATIVEANALYSIS, AND EVALUATES DESCRIPTOR RETRIEVAL TIME FOR EACH. PROPOSES APROBABILITY MODEL OF RETRIEVAL IN A COMBINED FILE. ON THE BASIS OF THIS MODEL,THE PROBLEM OF OPTIMISING A COMBINED FILE ACCORDING TO THE TIME CRITERION ISSOLVED.
2946|FUZZY REQUESTS' AN APPROACH TO WEIGHTED BOOLEAN SEARCHES.     CONCERNS THE PROBLEM OF HOW TO PERMIT A PATRON TO REPRESENT THE RELATIVEIMPORTANCE OF VARIOUS INDEX TERMS IN A BOOLEAN REQUEST WHILE RETAINING THEDESIRABLE PROPERTIES OF A BOOLEAN SYSTEM. CLASSICAL BOOLEAN SYSTEMS AREREVIEWED AND RELATED TO THE NOTION OF FUZZY SETS. THE FUZZY SET CONCEPT THENFORMS THE BASIS OF THE CONCEPT OF A FUZZY REQUEST IN WHICH WEIGHTS AREASSIGNED TO INDEX TERMS. THE PROPERTIES OF SUCH A SYSTEM ARE DISCUSSED, AND ITIS SHOWN THAT SUCH SYSTEMS RETAIN THE MANIPULABILITY OF TRADITIONAL BOOLEANREQUESTS.
2947|SEARCHING BIASES IN LARGE INTERACTIVE DOCUMENT RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS.     THE WAY THAT INDIVIDUALS CONSTRUCT AND MODIFY SEARCH QUERIES ON A LARGEINTERACTIVE DOCUMENT RETRIEVAL SYSTEM IS SUBJECT TO SYSTEMATIC BIASES SIMILARTO THOSE THAT HAVE BEEN DEMONSTRATED IN EXPERIMENTS ON JUDGMENTS UNDERUNCERTAINTY. THESE BIASES ARE SHARED BY BOTH NAIVE AND SOPHISTICATED SUBJECTSAND CAUSE THE INQUIRER TO CONSTRUCT AND MODIFY QUERIES INEFFICIENTLY. ASEARCHING ALGORITHM IS SUGGESTED THAT HELPS THE INQUIRER TO AVOID THE EFFECTOF THESE BIASES.
2948|AN EXPERIMENT ON THE PHENOMENA OF WORD OCCURRENCES.     DESCRIBES THE METHOD OF SELECTING INDEX TERMS DIRECTLY FROM A FREQUENCY LIST.WORD FREQUENCIES OF AN ARTICLE WERE ANALYSED WHOSE RESULTS CLEARLY INDICATETHAT THE AUTOMATED SELECTION OF INDEX TERMS FROM A FREQUENCY LIST HOLDS SOMEPROMISE FOR AUTOMATIC INDEXING.
2949|INDEXING EXHAUSTIVITY AND THE COMPUTATION OF SIMILARITY MATRICES.     SOME OF THE AUTOMATIC CLASSIFICATION PROCEDURES USED IN INFORMATION RETRIEVALDERIVE CLUSTERS OF DOCUMENTS FROM AN INTERMEDIATE SIMILARITY MATRIX, THECOMPUTATION OF WHICH INVOLVES COMPARING EACH OF THE DOCUMENTS IN THECOLLECTION WITH ALL OF THE OTHERS. IT HAS RECENTLY BEEN SUGGESTED THAT MANY OFTHESE COMPARISONS, SPECIFICALLY THOSE BETWEEN DOCUMENTS HAVING NO TERMS INCOMMON, MAY BE AVOIDED BY MEANS OF THE USE OF AN INVERTED FILE TO THE DOCUMENTCOLLECTION. IT IS SHOWN THAT THE APPROACH WILL EFFECT REDUCTIONS IN THE NUMBEROF INTERDOCUMENT COMPARISONS ONLY IF THE DOCUMENTS ARE EACH INDEXED BY ALIMITED NUMBER OF INDEXING TERMS; IF EXHAUSTIVE INDEXING IS USED, MANYDOCUMENT PAIRS WILL BE COMPARED SEVERAL TIMES OVER AND THE COMPUTATION WILL BEGREATER THAN WHEN CONVENTIONAL APPROACHES ARE USED TO GENERATE THE SIMILARITYMATRIX.
