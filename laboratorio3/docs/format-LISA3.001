PAPER PRESENTED AT THE 41|ST CONFERENCE OF THE GRADUATE LIBRARY SCHOOL,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO, 16|-17| MAY 80|, CHILDREN'S ACCESS TO SERVICES ANDMATERIALS IN SCHOOL AND PUBLIC LIBRARIES. THOUGH SOME LIBRARIANS AND TEACHERSBELIEVE CENSORSHIP IS A RECENT PHENOMENON, IT HAS BEEN A PART OF LIBRARIANS'LIVES FOR MORE THAN A CENTURY. INDEED, MANY LATE-19|TH CENTURY LIBRARIANSREGARDED THEMSELVES PRIMARILY AS CENSORS, DUTY-BOUND TO PROTECT THE YOUNG FROMSHODDY AND PERNICIOUS BOOKS, ESPECIALLY FICTION. SOME LIBRARIANS AND TEACHERSTODAY CARRY ON THIS CENSORIAL TRADITION BY CIRCULATING OR TEACHING ONLY WORKSOF HIGH LITERARY MERIT OR THE PROPER MORAL CONTENT. THOSE CENSORING ONLITERARY GROUNDS OFTEN PROVIDE ONLY SUBJECTIVE CRITERIA, JUSTIFYING CENSORSHIPBY THEIR OWN PERSONAL TASTES. THOSE CENSORING ON MORAL GROUNDS OFTEN PROVIDENO BETTER CRITERIA, JUSTIFYING CENSORSHIP BY THEIR OWN PERSONAL MORALITY.

IN BERLIN THE LIBRARY SCHOOL IS NOW COMPLETELY INTEGRATED INTO THE UNIVERSITYAS PART OF THE COMMUNICATION SCIENCE FACULTY, THE 1|ST TIME THAT THIS HASOCCURRED IN GERMANY. OBJECTIONS TO UNIVERSITY STATUS FOR LIBRARIANSHIP COURSESWERE FORMERLY MADE ON THE GROUNDS THAT THE LIBRARIANSHIP COURSES OCCUPY ONLY 6|SEMESTERS WHERE OTHER UNIVERSITY COURSES REQUIRE 8| OR 9| AND THAT A UNIVERSITYCOURSE WOULD PROVIDE INADEQUATE PRACTICAL TRAINING.

3154|THE CURRENT STAGE OF INTER-DEPARTMENTAL LIBRARY COOPERATION.     STAGES IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF INTER-LIBRARY COOPERATION IN THE USSR CAN BETRACED OVER THE LAST 30| YEARS. COOPERATION IS OF 3| TYPES' WITHIN THE FRAMEWORKOF A DEPARTMENT; INVOLVING LIBRARIES FROM SEVERAL DEPARTMENTS BUT ON THE SAMESITE OR IN THE SAME ECONOMIC FIELD; OR WITHOUT ANY SUCH BOUNDARIES. THE KEYELEMENT IS INTEGRATION' THE PLANNED COMBINATION OF RESOURCES FROM DIFFERENTLIBRARIES TO ENSURE THEIR EFFECTIVE EXPLOITATION. THIS IS THE BASIS FOR THEFORMATION OF A REGIONAL LIBRARY NETWORK. IN THE LONG-TERM, SUCH INTEGRATEDSYSTEMS WILL HAVE AN INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT ROLE TO PLAY IN SOVIETLIBRARIANSHIP.
3155|PROGRESS IN THE THEORY OF LIBRARY COORDINATION AND COOPERATION IN SCANDINAVIANCOUNTRIES.     THE BEGINNING OF COOPERATION AND COORDINATION IN SCANDINAVIA IN THE SPHERE OFLIBRARIANSHIP, BIBLIOGRAPHY AND INFORMATION CAN BE SEEN IN THE THEORETICALSTUDIES OF THE 1950|S. IT WAS THEN THAT THE SCANDIA-PLAN, AN INTERGOVERNMENTALPLAN OF COORDINATED ACQUISITIONS OF FOREIGN LITERATURE, WAS STARTED. RESEARCHINTO COOPERATION HAS DEVELOPED ALONG 3| MAIN LEVELS-NATIONAL, SCANDINAVIAN ANDINTERNATIONAL-AND THIS APPROACH IS REFLECTED IN THE RESEARCH METHODS EMPLOYED.MATHEMATICAL METHODS ARE USED IN SCANDINAVIAN STUDIES AND STATISTICALMATHEMATICS ARE THE NORM ON THE INTERNATIONAL LEVEL. THE SCANDINAVIAN SUCCESSIN LIBRARY COOPERATION DESERVES GREATER ATTENTION ON THE PART OF SOVIETLIBRARIANS.

THELATTER IS DEFINED AS A UNIQUE COMBINATION OF COALITIONS SUCH THAT EVERYPARTICIPATING LIBRARY IS A MEMBER OF 1| AND ONLY 1| COALITION AND THE DIVISIONEXHAUSTS ALL 'N' LIBRARIES.
3158|THE PUBLIC LIBRARY AS A SOCIAL MILIEU.     IN DENMARK THE PUBLIC LIBRARY IS THE CENTRE OF COMMUNICATION AND CULTURE,SINCE THERE IS MORE EMPHASIS HERE THAN IN GERMANY ON THEATRICAL AND MUSICALACTIVITIES. LIBRARIES ARE BUILT MAINLY FROM WOOD, SLATE AND GLASS, WITH ASTRUCTURE DESIGNED TO SUIT A WIDE RANGE OF ACTIVITIES; THEY ARE ALWAYSSITUATED CENTRALLY WITHIN THEIR AREA. PUPPET THEATRES, TOYS, FACILITIES FORPAINTING AND LISTENING TO MUSIC AND EVEN LITTLE PUSH-CHAIRS FOR THE SMALLESTCHILDREN ARE PROVIDED IN LIBRARIES WITH A LARGE PROPORTION OF CHILD READERS.ALL LIBRARIES CONTAIN AT LEAST ONE ROOM FOR MEETINGS. BASIC STOCKS ALWAYSCONTAIN GERMAN AND ENGLISH LANGUAGE MATERIAL AND TALKING BOOKS FOR THE OLD ANDPARTIALLY SIGHTED.

A STUDY WAS CONDUCTED IN 4| NORTH AMERICAN UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES TO ASSESSJERALD HAGE AND MICHAEL AIKEN'S THEORY THAT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THESTRUCTURAL VARIABLE COMPLEXITY AND RATE OF INNOVATION IS POSITIVE AND THAT ITIS NEGATIVE FOR CENTRALISATION, FORMALISATION, AND STRATIFICATION. FINDINGSSUPPORT THE THEORY AND THE METHODOLOGY, WITH SOME MODIFICATIONS, WAS SHOWN TOBE TRANSFERABLE.
3165|LIBRARY DATA COLLECTION HANDBOOK.     DESCRIBES BASIC MANAGEMENT INFORMATION USEFUL IN ACADEMIC, PUBLIC, SCHOOL, ANDSPECIAL LIBRARIES. AN UNDERLYING PREMISE OF THE HANDBOOK IS THAT ALL TYPES OFLIBRARIES HAVE A COMMON SET OF FUNCTIONS, PURPOSES, AND RESOURCES WHICHOUTWEIGH THE DIFFERENCES IN SETTING, SIZE, OR ORGANISATIONAL GOALS. PRESENTS ASET OF CATEGORIES OF INFORMATION THAT ARE JUDGED TO BE IMPORTANT IN DESCRIBINGTHE LIBRARY, AND PROVIDES DEFINITION OF THOSE CATEGORIES.
3166|TOWARDS PROBLEM-ORIENTED INFORMATION SYSTEM' A NEW PERSPECTIVE FOR INFORMATIONORGANISATION IN U.S.     DISCUSSES A RECENT REPORT PUBLISHED IN THE USA THAT SUGGESTS A NEW PERSPECTIVEFOR ORGANISING INFORMATION SYSTEMS FOR PROBLEM-SOLVING. THE ORGANISINGPRINCIPLE IS SCIENCE, TECHNICAL AND SOCIETAL INFORMATION (STSI) FOR THISPURPOSE. EXAMINES THE RELEVANCE OF THIS STUDY TO THE SITUATION OBTAINING ININDIA.
3167|MALPRACTICE LIABILITY' MYTH OR REALITY.     MALPRACTICE MAY BE DEFINED AS ANY PROFESSIONAL MISCONDUCT OR UNREASONABLE LACKOF SKILL IN THE PERFORMANCE OF PROFESSIONAL DUTIES THROUGH INTENTIONALCARELESSNESS OR SIMPLE IGNORANCE. ARGUES THAT LIBRARIANS AS PROFESSIONALSCOULD POSSIBLY BE SUED FOR MALPRACTICE, ALTHOUGH SUCH A CASE HAS NOT YETOCCURRED. SUGGESTS MEANS BY WHICH LIBRARIANS MAY HELP TO AVOID THE POSSIBILITYOF MALPRACTICE. CONCLUDES THAT THE LIBRARY PROFESSION MUST MAKE RENEWEDEFFORTS TOWARD IMPROVING THE COMPETENCY OF THE PROFESSIONAL PRACTITIONER.
3168|POLICY MANUAL. EUGENE PUBLIC LIBRARY, LIBRARY BOARD, EUGENE, OREGON.     PREPARED FOR THE LIBRARY AND THE LIBRARY BOARD; THIS POLICY MANUAL GOVERNS THEOPERATIONS OF THE LIBRARY AND ITS RELATIONSHIPS WITH OTHER LIBRARIES AND THECOMMUNITY.

3169|ON THE ART OF MANAGEMENT IN ACADEMIC LIBRARIES' A PROLEGOMENON.     DISCUSSES 3| ASPECTS OF THE ACADEMIC LIBRARY MANAGER'S RESPONSIBILITY' MANAGINGRELATIONS OF THE LIBRARY WITH THE REST OF THE INSTITUTION (INVOLVING THELIBRARY IN THE FORMULATION AND IMPLEMENTATION OF INSTITIONAL OBJECTIVES);MANAGING CONFLICTS WITHIN THE LIBRARY (THE MOST APPROPRIATE ATTITUDE BEING ACONSULTATIVE ADMINISTRATIVE STYLE DISTINGUISHED BY THE DEVELOPMENT OFAUTHORITY RATHER THAN RELIANCE ON LEGISLATED POWER); AND MANAGING CHANGESWROUGHT BY TECHNOLOGY (PERCEIVING TECHNOLOGY AS A MORE EFFICIENT MEANS FOROBTAINING THE LIBRARY'S TRADITIONAL GOALS).
3170|METHODOLOGICAL GUIDANCE TO LIBRARIES.     THE AIM OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY OF BULGARIA IS TO TRANSFORM ALL BULGARIANCITIZENS INTO HARMONIOUS PERSONALITIES. THIS EFFORT REQUIRES SUBSTANTIALPARTICIPATION BY LIBRARIES, BOTH PUBLIC AND SPECIAL. THE NUMBER OF READERS ANDFREQUENCY OF LOANS MUST BE MONITORED. THUS LIBRARIANS MUST BECOME FAMILIAR NOTONLY WITH THEIR READERS' INTERESTS BUT ALSO WITH THE DETAILS OF THE LITERATUREPRESENTED TO THEM. LIBRARIANS MUST NOT BE LEFT ALONE BUT ASSISTED AND GUIDEDEVEN MORE THAN BEFORE BY EXPERT ADVISERS, WORKING IN PARTICULAR AT THEMETHODOLOGICAL CENTRES OF REGIONAL CENTRAL LIBRARIES. THEIR WORK MUST BEADAPTED TO THE NEW, MUCH MORE COMPLICATED REQUIREMENTS OF THE 1980|S AND BEMORE EFFICIENT, TOO. BUREAUCRACY AND FORMALISM HAVE TO BE ELIMINATED,ACTIVITIES MUCH BETTER COORDINATED. THE CYRIL AND METHODIUS NATIONAL LIBRARYIN SOFIA MUST RETAIN LEADERSHIP IN THIS FIELD.
3171|SERIAL COST EFFICIENCY-A MODEL AND CASE STUDY (IN HEBREW).     HIGH RATE INFLATION IN PERIODICAL SUBSCRIPTION PRICES WITHOUT ADEQUATE BUDGETINCREMENTS FORCE MANY LIBRARIES TO FREEZE NEW SUBSCRIPTIONS AND IN MANY CASESTO CANCEL SUBSCRIPTIONS. THE PROCESS OF DESELECTION RAISES THE QUESTION OFWHICH TITLES WILL BE RETAINED AND WHICH WILL BE DISCONTINUED. SUGGESTS THATTHE EVALUATION OF THE RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF THE VARIOUS TITLES WILL BE DONEBY USING A COST EFFICIENCY FORMULA. THE FORMULA COMBINES 2| FACTORS, THE PRICEOF SUBSCRIPTION AND THE MEASURED USE OF THE JOURNAL, AND RANKS PERIODICALS INA GIVEN COLLECTION IN A DESCENDING ORDER' AT THE TOP WILL BE THE MOSTCOST-EFFICIENT TITLE AND AT THE BOTTOM THE LEAST COST-EFFICIENT TITLE. THISFORMULA WAS TRIED IN CONJUNCTION WITH A USE STUDY OF THE JUDAICA READINGROOM'S OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES DURING 1978|.
3172|LIBRARY SYSTEMS ANALYSIS 2|' PLANNING TECHNIQUES.     THE SYSTEMS ANALYST MUST 1|ST LEARN EVERYTHING ABOUT THE PRESENT SYSTEM AND ITSSHORTCOMINGS, THEN FIND OUT WHAT IS NEEDED TO OVERCOME THESE SHORTCOMINGS.BRIEFLY DISCUSSES THE TECHNIQUES OF INTERVIEWING, INPUT/OUTPUT ANALYSIS,OBSERVATION AND DATA RECORDING.
3173|SOME THOUGHTS ON THE FINANCING OF LIBRARIES.     ARGUES THAT SAVING MONEY FOR THE UNIVERSITY BY CUTTING ITS LIBRARY BUDGET ISCOUNTERPRODUCTIVE. THE ARGUMENT IS APPLIED TO SUCH AREAS AS STAFF CUTS ANDPROCESSING BACKLOGS, SERIOUS REDUCTIONS IN SERVICE LEADING TO UNDERMINING OFTHE LIBRARY'S SUPPORTIVE ROLE FOR THE UNIVERSITY'S TEACHING AND RESEARCHFUNCTION. ARGUES THAT RATIONALISATION OF SUBJECT INTERESTS AND SUBJECTS TAUGHTBY THE UNIVERSITIES IN AN AREA SHOULD LEAD TO MORE EFFICIENT USE OF RESOURCES.
3174|THE RESEARCH LIBRARIES ARE LIMPING SADLY BEHIND-SHOWS NEW REPORT ON THECONDITIONS OF RESEARCH IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR.     ACCORDING TO A REPORT ISSUED IN APRIL 81| BY THE RESEARCH SECRETARIAT, DENMARKLAGS BEHIND OTHER EUROPEAN COUNTRIES IN ITS SUPPORT FOR RESEARCH, BOTH PUBLICAND PRIVATE. THE REPORT DEALS SEPARATELY WITH RESEARCH LIBRARIES AND DESCRIBESTHE CONSEQUENCES OF THE CUTS BOTH FOR LIBRARIES AND THEIR MOTHER INSTITUTIONS;IT SHOWS THAT THE LIBRARIES USE LESS THAN 10|% OF THE EXPENDITURE ON RESEARCH.INCLUDES COMMENTS ON THE REPORT BY THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THE JOINTCOUNCIL OF RESEARCH LIBRARIES. THE COMMITTEE SUPPORTS THE CONCLUSION THAT THERESEARCH LIBRARIES' ECONOMIC PROBLEMS SHOULD BE SOLVED IN CONJUNCTION WITH,AND PREFERABLY BEFORE, ANY CHANGE IN THEIR STRUCTURE AND MANAGEMENT. IT POINTSOUT THAT FIGURES FOR RUNNING COSTS OF RESEARCH LIBRARIES UNDER THE CULTURALMINISTRY, AFTER ADJUSTMENT, SHOW A GREATER FALL THAN OF THOSE UNDER THEEDUCATION MINISTRY.
3175|LIBRARIANSHIP IN THE UNDERDEVELOPED COUNTRIES.     PAPER PRESENTED AT A CONFERENCE ON READING MATERIALS FOR LIBRARY EDUCATION,WEST BERLIN, 15|-20| DEC 80|. IN THE UNDERDEVELOPED COUNTRIES THE AVERAGE CITIZENIS POOR AND ILLITERATE AND 90|% OF THE POPULATION LIVES IN RURAL AREAS, WHERETRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATION SERVICES ARE EXTREMELY LIMITED. IN MOSTUNDERDEVELOPED COUNTRIES THE FINANCIAL BUDGET ALLOCATED TO LIBRARY STAFF ANDBOOKSTOCK IS EXTREMELY LIMITED. IN ADDITION, IN SOME COUNTRIES CONSIDERABLESUMS HAVE BEEN SPENT ON THE CONSTRUCTION OF CITY LIBRARIES TO U.K. AND U.S.A.STANDARDS WITH A CONSEQUENT REDUCTION IN FUNDS FOR RURAL AREAS. THE AVAILABLERESOURCES SHOULD BE DIVIDED MORE EVENLY TO PROVIDE IMPROVED SERVICESTHROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE COUNTRY.
3176|ANDREW CARNEGIE'S ROLE IN AMERICAN PUBLIC LIBRARY DEVELOPMENT.     (PHD DISSERTATION-UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN). OVER $40| MILLION IN CARNEGIE GRANTSWAS DONATED TO 1|,412| US COMMUNITIES BETWEEN 1886| AND 1917|. ANALYSES THESEGRANTS IN DETAIL; DESCRIBES THE MECHANISM OF GRANT DISTRIBUTION; PAINTSPORTRAITS OF THE LEADING PEOPLE INVOLVED; AND EVALUATES ANDREW CARNEGIE'SEFFECT ON US PUBLIC LIBRARY DEVELOPMENT, CONCLUDING THAT HIS INFLUENCE ISSTILL BEING FELT.
3177|THE AUSTRALIAN AND NEW ZEALAND RESPONSE TO CCNY GRANTS FOR LIBRARY DEVELOPMENT.     AUSTRALIAN AND NEW ZEALAND LIBRARIANSHIP HAD MUCH IN COMMON IN THE 1930|S,STEMMING FROM A COMMON UK TRADITION, YET EACH COUNTRY MADE QUITE A DIFFERENTRESPONSE TO THE CARNEGIE CORPORATION OF NEW YORK AID PROGRAMME TO STIMULATELIBRARY DEVELOPMENT. THE NEW ZEALAND RESPONSE WAS MUCH MORE POSITIVE AND MANYDEVELOPMENTS TOOK PLACE IN THE 1930|S-40|S; IN AUSTRALIA, SOME EQUIVALENTDEVELOPMENTS WERE NOT ACCOMPLISHED UNTIL THE 1960|S. EXAMINES THE REASONS FORTHIS.
3178|ON THE QUESTION OF CHARGING FOR PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVICES.     A STATEMENT FROM THE DEUTSCHER BIBLIOTHEKSVERBAND (GERMAN LIBRARYASSOCIATION.) THE CHARGES UNDER DISCUSSION ARE FOR THE LOAN OF BOOKS,PERIODICALS AND OTHER MEDIA, AND DO NOT REFER TO SPECIAL SERVICES SUCH ASPHOTOCOPYING. THE ASSOCIATION IS STRONGLY OPPOSED TO CHARGES BEING MADE FORBASIC SERVICES WHICH IT REGARDS AS A RETROGRADE STEP THAT COULD ONLY HARM THEPUBLIC LIBRARY SERVICE AND DETRACT FROM ITS EDUCATIONAL AND SOCIAL VALUE INTHE COMMUNITY. THE DETRIMENTAL EFFECTS FAR OUTWEIGH ANY POSSIBLE FINANCIALGAIN.
3179|THE LIBRARY SITUATION IN ENGLAND' INCREASING DEMAND FOR SELF-FINANCING OFSERVICE IMPROVEMENTS.     EXAMINES THE STATE OF LIBRARIES IN THE UK. DURING THE LAST 5| YEARS PUBLICLIBRARIES ESPECIALLY HAVE BEEN SUBJECT TO CUTS RESULTING IN FEWERACQUISITIONS, CLOSURE OF BRANCHES, REDUCED OPENING HOURS AND FREEZING OF STAFFPOSTS. AT THE SAME TIME ATTEMPTS ARE MADE TO INCREASE INCOME THROUGH INCREASEDFINES AND SALE OF DISCARDED MATERIAL AND PAMPHLETS, ALTHOUGH LENDING FEES HAVENOT YET BEEN IMPOSED. INTRODUCTION OF AUTOMATION IN LIBRARIES IS SEEN BY MANYAS A MEANS OF REDUCING STAFF EXPENDITURE AND IMPROVING SERVICES TO THE PUBLIC,ESPECIALLY COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY. THE LIBRARY PROVISION FOR CHILDREN, NEVERVERY GOOD COMPARED TO DANISH PUBLIC LIBRARIES, HAS BEEN STRUCK PARTICULARLYHARD BY THE CUTS. THE REACTION AGAINST THE CUTS HAS BEEN LED BY NALGO IN THEFORM OF WORK STOPPAGES AND BY THE LIBRARY ASSOCIATION AS PROTESTS TO THEAUTHORITIES.
3180|WE MUST PRESENT THE FULL BREADTH OF THE SWEDISH BOOK MARKET.     INTERVIEWS JAN GUMPERT, DIRECTOR OF THE SWEDISH LIBRARY SERVICE, WHO DISCUSSESTHE IMPACT OF CUTS ON THE LIBRARIES. LOCAL AUTHORITIES ARE FINDING THEIRCULTURAL BUDGETS, WITH LIBRARIES AS THE LARGEST ITEM, EASY TARGETS. ATTEMPTSARE MADE TO SAVE THE BOOK BUDGET AS FAR AS POSSIBLE AND CUTS ARE MADE INSTEADIN OPENING HOURS AND ACTIVITIES. VACANCIES ARE LIKELY TO BE FROZEN. FOR THELIBRARY SERVICE THE CUTS MEAN THAT THE STOCK OF OLDER TITLES WILL HAVE TO BEREDUCED, BUT THERE ARE NO PLANS TO CUT THE NUMBER OF TITLES OFFERED. EXPORT OFLIBRARY FURNITURE TO THE ARAB WORLD ALLEVIATES SOMEWHAT THE LACK OF MARKETS INSWEDEN. THE SERVICE'S COMPUTER SYSTEM, BUMS, IS NOW INSTALLED IN 34| LOCALAUTHORITIES. THERE IS CLOSE COOPERATION WITH THE RESEARCH LIBRARIES'AUTOMATION SYSTEM LIBRIS. DISCUSSES THE IMPACT OF THE LITERATURE COMMISSIONAND THE POSSIBLE EFFECTS OF THE PUBLIC LIBRARIES COMMISSION.
3181|A CHOICE BETWEEN QUALITY OR QUANTITY' THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE RECRUITMENT BANIN ENSCHEDE PUBLIC LIBRARY.     SINCE THE WORLD WAR II THE PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVICE IN THE NETHERLANDS HASUNDERGONE A PERIOD OF RAPID GROWTH. IN MANY TOWNS, NEW CENTRAL LIBRARIES ANDBRANCH LIBRARIES HAVE BEEN OPENED AND SPECIAL SERVICES HAVE BEEN INITIATED,SUCH AS MOBILE LIBRARY SERVICES, RECORD LIBRARIES AND SERVICES TO FOREIGNWORKERS AND OPEN SCHOOL STUDENTS. IN ADDITION, THE DUTCH GOVERNMENT PLANS TOINCREASE THE NUMBER OF REGIONAL SUPPORT LIBRARIES FROM 13| TO 19|. HOWEVER,ENSCHEDE PUBLIC LIBRARY, WHICH HAS BEEN DESIGNATED A REGIONAL SUPPORT LIBRARY,IS COMPELLED BY FINANCIAL CUTBACKS TO REDUCE ITS PRESENT STAFFING LEVELS BY25|%. AS A RESULT THE LIBRARY WILL BE UNABLE TO MAINTAIN THE CURRENT VOLUME OFLOANS AND CONSIDERATION HAS BEEN GIVEN TO LIMITING THE NUMBER OF BOOKS WHICH ABORROWER MAY TAKE THROUGHOUT THE YEAR AND TO REFUSING TO ENROL NEW MEMBERS.
3182|WORD PROCESSING' AN INTRODUCTION AND APPRAISAL.     IDENTIFIES AND DESCRIBES THE FACILITIES AVAILABLE FOR MECHANISING ANDAUTOMATING LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SERVICES USING WORD PROCESSING SYSTEMS-TEXTSTORAGE AND SEARCHING, ORDER PROCESSING AND BUDGET CONTROL, PREPARATION OFCATALOGUES, CIRCULATION CONTROL, PERIODICALS CONTROL AND CIRCULATION,INFORMATION STORAGE AND RETRIEVAL SYSTEM USE, AND POSSIBLE FUTURE USES.

3184|INDISPENSIBLE CONSIDERATIONS IN AUTOMATING LIBRARY TECHNIQUES.     LIBRARIES, DESPITE THEIR TRADITION-MINDED REPUTATION, ALWAYS WERE SENSIBLEABOUT THE TECHNICAL ASPECTS OF THEIR DUTIES AND OPEN TO INNOVATIONS.CONSEQUENTLY THE APPLICATION OF COMPUTER TECHNIQUES HERE IS DISCUSSED. THESESYSTEMS USUALLY ARE NOT DEVELOPED ON UNIQUE PRINCIPLES FOR LIBRARY PURPOSES,BUT HAVE BEEN ADAPTED FROM PRINCIPLES ALREADY EXISTING IN OTHER APPLICATIONS.SOME OF THESE PRINCIPLES ARE MORE APT FOR APPLICATION IN LIBRARIES THAN OTHERSREGARDING THE SPECIAL DUTIES OF LIBRARIES TOWARDS THEIR USERS. THIS FACT TODAYSEEMS TO BE SLIGHTLY UNDERRATED WHEN LIBRARIES DECIDE ABOUT THE ACQUISITION OFAN AUTOMATED SYSTEM.
3185|RECENT BREAKTHROUGHS IN LIBRARY AUTOMATION IN TAIWAN.     HIGHLIGHTS THE PROCEEDINGS OF THE INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP ON CHINESE LIBRARYAUTOMATION HELD IN TAIPEI, 14|-19| FEB 81| AND SUMMARISES THE KEY PAPERS WHICHREPORT SUCH IMPORTANT RECENT BREAKTHROUGHS AS THE DEVELOPMENT OF COMPUTERINPUT AND OUTPUT DEVICES FOR CHINESE SCRIPTS, THE DESIGN OF A CROSS-REFERENCEINPUT OF CHINESE CHARACTERS, THE COMPILATION OF 2|CHINESE CHARACTER CODE FORINFORMATION INTERCHANGE1|, THE COMPLETE REVISION OF 2|CHINESE CATALOGUINGRULES1|, THE ADOPTION OF CHINESE MARC FORMAT, AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF APROTOTYPE ON-LINE CATALOGUING SYSTEM.

WITH AUTHOR AND TITLE DATAALREADY IN THE DATA BASE, THE INTRODUCTION OF AN ON-LINE PUBLIC ACCESSCATALOGUE WITH A TOUCH SENSITIVE TERMINAL, OPENED IN OCT 80|, WAS FACILITATED.THE CARD CATALOGUE IS, HOWEVER, BEING MAINTAINED, AS THE INPUT OF SUBJECT DATAIS NOT YET COMPLETE AND AS A SAFEGUARD AGAINST COMPUTER BREAK-DOWNS. THE EXTRACOSTS INVOLVED HAD NOT BEEN FORESEEN, AND SAVINGS ON STAFF ARE NOT YETPOSSIBLE. IT IS, THEREFORE, DIFFICULT TO CALCULATE THE LONG-TERM SAVINGS FROMAUTOMATION. THE PROFESSIONAL GAINS ARE, HOWEVER, CLEAR' THE CATALOGUE ENABLESPRECISE LOCATION OF MATERIAL AND COMPILATION OF USEFUL STATISTICS, ANDSIMPLIFIES ALTERATIONS. MOREOVER, TERMINALS CAN BE PLACED OUTSIDE THE LIBRARY,IN THE TOWN HALL AND EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS.

3193|THE ETHICS OF FURTHER EDUCATION LIBRARIANSHIP.     THE LIBRARIAN'S 'CLIENTS' IN THE FURTHER EDUCATION SECTOR ARE IDENTIFIED. HISDUTIES TOWARDS THEM AND THE PROBLEMS RAISED BY THEM ARE DISCUSSED, WITHSPECIAL REFERENCE TO THE EDUCATION OF THE 16|-19| AGE GROUP. THE NEED FOR THELIBRARIAN TO HOLD THEIR DIVERSE AND SOMETIMES CONFLICTING DEMANDS IN BALANCEIS SEEN AS AN ASPECT OF HIS DUTIES THAT REQUIRES PROFESSIONAL AUTONOMY FOR ITSSATISFACTORY PERFORMANCE. THE NEED FOR A BALANCED USE OF THE FACILITIES,COVERAGE OF SUBJECT AREAS, PROVISION FOR DIVERGENT VIEWS, AND ENCOURAGEMENT OFFREE ENQUIRY LEADS TO THE SUGGESTION THAT TREATMENT RATHER THAN IDEAS IS WHATTHE LIBRARIAN IS BEST QUALIFIED TO ASSESS. PORNOGRAPHY IS DISCUSSED INRELATION TO THIS AND OTHER CRITERIA. THE GROWTH OF OPEN LEARNING IS SEEN ASDEMANDING A POSITIVE TUTORIAL APPROACH. THE NEED FOR MORAL COURAGE ISAFFIRMED.
3194|LEADERSHIP BY NONADMINISTRATORS IN ACADEMIC LIBRARIES.     LEADERSHIP BY THOSE NOT IN POSITIONS OF AUTHORITY IN LIBRARIES HAS USUALLYBEEN DISCUSSED IN TERMS OF PARTICIPATION IN MANAGEMENT. A NUMBER OF OTHERMODELS ARE GIVEN' PARTICIPATION AND FEEDBACK MODELS, INCLUDING THE EVALUATIONOF SUPERIORS; MODELS OF CONFRONTATION AND RISK TAKING, INCLUDING ACTION TOOVERCOME MISMANAGEMENT AND ASSERTION OF EMPLOYEES' RIGHTS; AND MODELS FORCHANGE AGENTS, INCLUDING USE OF STAFF ORGANISATIONS, INFORMAL ACTION NETWORKS,AND RESOURCE EXCHANGE NETWORKS. THE THEORY IS THAT A 'SERVANT LEADERSHIP' BYLOWER AND MIDDLE LEVEL STAFF MAY PROMOTE SERVICE BY LIBRARIES AND ALSOINCREASE ATTENTION TO THE IMPORTANCE OF THE WORK TO THE STAFF THEMSELVES. THEACTION MODELS SHOULD BE TESTED AND RELATED TO A CAREER-STAGE MODEL WHICHIDENTIFIES POWER AND INFLUENCE BY THOSE WHO ARE NOT MANAGERS.

THE INTRODUCTION OF THE NEW GUIDELINES, AACR2|, EXACERBATED THESERECORD CONFLICTS. TO REDUCE LIBRARY COSTS, WHICH MIGHT INCREASE DRAMATICALLYAS USERS ATTEMPTED TO RESOLVE THOSE CONFLICTS, OCLC CONVERTED NAME HEADINGSAND UNIFORM TITLES IN ITS DATA BASE TO AACR2| FORM.
3359|OCLC'S DATABASE CONVERSION' A USER'S PERSPECTIVE.     DESCRIBES THE EXPERIENCE OF A LARGE ACADEMIC LIBRARY WITH HEADINGS IN THE OCLCDATA BASE THAT HAVE BEEN CONVERTED TO AACR2| FORM. IT ALSO CONSIDERS THE USE OFLC AUTHORITY RECORDS IN THE DATA BASE. SPECIFIC PROBLEMS ARE DISCUSSED,INCLUDING SOME RESULTING FROM LC PRACTICES. NEVERTHELESS, THE PRESENCE OF THEAUTHORITY RECORDS, AND ESPECIALLY THE CONVERSION OF ABOUT 40|% OF THE HEADINGSIN THE BIBLIOGRAPHIC FILE, HAS BEEN OF GREAT BENEFIT TO THE LIBRARY,SIGNIFICANTLY SPEEDING UP THE CATALOGUING OPERATION.
3360|OCLC-AN AMERICAN INFORMATION SYSTEM ON ITS WAY TO DENMARK.     LIBRARY AUTOMATION BEGAN IN 1965| WITH THE FIRST MARC PILOT PROJECT INITIATEDBY THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS AND SOON TAKEN UP BY THE BRITISH NATIONALBIBLIOGRAPHY. INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS HAVE BEEN DRAWN UP TO SECURE WORLDWIDEUSE OF THE SYSTEM, CULMINATING IN THE ATTEMPT TO CREATE UNIVERSALBIBLIOGRAPHIC CONTROL. HOWEVER, EXCHANGE OF INTERNATIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHIC DATAHAS BEEN BESET BY PROBLEMS, SO THAT INTERNATIONAL USE OF MACHINE READABLEINFORMATION IS NOT VERY WIDESPREAD. THE USE OF INTERNATIONAL, ENGLISH LANGUAGEBASED STANDARDS AND EXCHANGE OF ACTUAL TAPE HAVE CAUSED PROBLEMS INSCANDINAVIA. FOR THESE REASONS BIBLIOGRAPHIC SERVICE CENTRES, 'UTILITIES',HAVE BEEN SET UP IN USA AND ENGLAND, AN IDEA WHICH IS ALSO BEHIND THE DANISHSYSTEMS SAMKAT AND BIBLIOTEKSDATA. THE LARGEST IS THE US OCLC, WHICH BEGAN IN1967|. ITS MAIN TASK IS DEVELOPMENT OF A BIBLIOGRAPHIC DATA BASE ANDDECENTRALISED CATALOGUING, WHICH SUPPLIES THE BASE WITH 60|, 000| TITLESANNUALLY FROM 4|,000| TERMINALS. IT ALSO OPERATES AN INTERLENDING SYSTEM, ANDHOPES TO ADD ACCESSIONS AND ISSUE CONTROL SYSTEMS TO THE SERVICES. THE MAINPRODUCT IS CATALOGUE CARDS. WITH THE ESTABLISHMENT OF 'OCLC EUROPE', DANISHLIBRARIES WILL HAVE TO TAKE A STAND FOR OR AGAINST COOPERATION WITH IT.

3365|CATALOGUES ON FILM.     DESCRIBES CHICAGO PUBLIC LIBRARY'S AUTOMATION SYSTEM. IN 1974| THE LIBRARYJOINED THE OCLC NETWORK AND TODAY ALL TECHNICAL DEPARTMENTS ARE AUTOMATED. THEUSERS MEET AUTOMATION THROUGH THE COM CATALOGUE (COMPUTER OUTPUT MICROFILM), ASYSTEM REGARDED AS MUCH CHEAPER THAN AN ON-LINE CATALOGUE. THERE WERE MANYTEETHING TROUBLES INVOLVED IN THE INITIAL USE OF THE CATALOGUE, PARTICULARLYIN THE BRANCH LIBRARIES, AND THE AUTOMATED ACQUISITION SYSTEM LED TO A VERYTIGHT BUDGET CONTROL OVER THE BRANCHES. ALTHOUGH NEW EDITIONS OF THE COMCATALOGUE TAKE LONGER TO ARRIVE THAN PROMISED IT HAS LED TO IMPROVEDINTERLENDING SERVICE. THE PUBLIC, HOWEVER, CONTINUE TO USE THE OLDDISCONTINUED CARD CATALOGUE AS, IT WAS CLAIMED, THEY ARE NOT INTERESTED IN THELIBRARY SERVICE'S TOTAL HOLDINGS, BUT ONLY IN THE STOCK OF THE LIBRARY BRANCHUSED. THE STAFF, TOO, DESPITE LACK OF ORGANISED OPPOSITION, EXPRESSEDCRITICISM OF THE AUTOMATION PROGRAMME.

THE QUESTION OF 'MIGRATION'(FROM PRINTED TO ON-LINE DATA BASE PRODUCTS) AND THE FACT THAT EXPENSES HAVEINCREASED MORE THAN INCOME ARE DISCUSSED AS THEY RELATE TO THE SURVIVAL ORGROWTH OF DATA BASE ORGANISATIONS. SINCE THE DATA BASE HAS GONE ON-LINE, THEREHAVE BEEN SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN THE DATA BASE REVENUE, CONNECT HOURS, ANDNUMBERS OF ON-LINE USERS. AT THE SAME TIME, THERE HAVE BEEN DECREASES IN THENUMBER OF DATA BASE LEASES AND LICENCES, THE NUMBER OF PRINT PRODUCTSUBSCRIPTIONS, AND THE EXCESS OF INCOME OVER EXPENSES. IN CONSTA NT DOLLARS,THE COST OF PRODUCING AN ABSTRACT HAS DECREASED, THE SUBSCRIPTION CHARGE FORPRINTED PRODUCTS HAS INCREASED ONLY SLIGHTLY, THE LEASE AND LICENSE FEES HAVEDECREASED, ROYALTY CHARGES HAVE INCREASED, AND HOURLY CONNECT FEES HAVEREMAINED STEADY (EVEN THOUGH THE SIZE OF THE ON-LINE FILE HAS INCREASEDGREATLY). THE PROBLEM IS THAT OF MAINTAINING A BALANCED FINANCIAL STATUS INLIGHT OF INCREASED INCOME FROM ONE CLASS OF PRODUCTS, DECREASED INCOME FROMANOTHER CLASS OF PRODUCTS, AND INCREASED COST OF OPERATION. POSSIBLEAPPROACHES TO ENSURE ECONOMIC VIABILITY ARE CONSIDERED IN TERMS OF EXPENSES,EFFICIENCY OF OPERATION, MARKETING, PRODUCTS, SERVICES, AND PRICING. THE MOSTPROMISING APPROACHES LIE IN THE AREAS OF PRICING AND DEVELOPMENT OF NEWPRODUCTS AND SERVI CES.

DISPUTESTHIS CLAIM BY EXAMINING IN DETAIL THE EFFECTS OF AUTOMATED SYSTEMS ON THE JOBCONTENT AND JOB SATISFACTION OF 2| TYPES OF CLERICAL JOBS' PRODUCTION CONTROLAND TELE-SALES. THE SOURCE OF THE DECLINE IN THE QUALITY OF WORKING LIFE INTHESE 2| AREAS IS LOCATED NOT IN THE TECHNOLOGY ITSELF BUT MANAGEMENT AIMS ANDMETHODS IN ITS IMPLEMENTATION. SUGGESTS POSSIBLE ALTERNATIVE METHODS OF WORKORGANISATION.
3461|THE 'ELECTRONIC OFFICE'-THE IMPACT OF ORGANISATIONAL AND BEHAVIOURAL FACTORS.     DISCUSSES FACTORS PROMOTING CHANGE IN THE OFFICE ENVIRONMENT-GOVERNMENTALENCOURAGEMENT, TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS, GREATER EFFICIENCY FOR ORGANISATIONS,SUPPLIERS AND THE RESIDENTIAL MARKET. ALSO DESCRIBES ATTITUDINAL,ORGANISATIONAL, ECONOMIC AND REGULATORY FACTORS AGAINST TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE.OUTLINES PRESSURES ON ORGANISATIONS TO ADOPT NEW METHODS AND THE ROLE OF THEGOVERNMENT. CONCLUDES THAT IN THE NEXT DECADE SOCIETY'S ATTITUDES WILLINFLUENCE ORGANISATIONAL PRACTICE AND THE GOVERNMENT, WHO WILL CARRY THE MAJORRESPONSIBILITY TO ENSURE THAT ANY NEGATIVE SIDE EFFECTS ARE PROPERLY DEALTWITH.
3462|OFFICE SYSTEMS AND PEOPLE.     OFFICES ARE ORGANISATIONAL UNITS IN WHICH INFORMATION IS PROCESSED BY PEOPLE.IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT WE UNDERSTAND THE ATTITUDES AND REQUIREMENTS OF THESEPEOPLE BEFORE WE ATTEMPT TO DESIGN SYSTEMS FOR THEM. WE NEED MODELS OF OFFICESAND OF OFFICE WORK, FOR USE AS A BASIS FOR SYSTEM DESIGN AND SYSTEMEVALUATION. MODELS CAN BE DEVELOPED THROUGH STUDIES OF OFFICES AND INPARTICULAR THROUGH OBSERVATIONS OF HOW ELECTRONIC OFFICE SYSTEMS IMPACT OFFICEWORK. SUMMARISES RECENT RESEARCH WORK IN THESE AREAS, AND SHOWS HOW IT CANASSIST US IN DESIGNING SYSTEMS THAT MEET THE NEEDS OF OFFICE WORKERS.

3464|THE ELECTRONIC OFFICE.     DESCRIBES THE FUNCTIONS AND EQUIPMENT OF THE FORECAST 'ELECTRONIC OFFICE' BYCONSIDERING IN FUNDAMENTAL TERMS THE FUNCTIONS OF AN 'OFFICE' AND THE WAYS INWHICH MATURE ELECTRONIC INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY COULD BE DEPLOYED TO HELPPEOPLE CARRY OUT SUCH FUNCTIONS. CONCLUDES THAT EVEN AFTER THE TECHNOLOGICALPROBLEMS HAVE BEEN SOLVED, THE TIMING IS LIKELY TO BE DETERMINED BY ACOMMERCIAL STICK/SLIP PROCESS SO THAT FOR A LONG TIME THE NEW TECHNOLOGY WILLHAVE LITTLE IMPACT UPON NORMAL MODES OF OFFICE WORK BUT WHEN CHANGES STARTOCCURRING THEY WILL PROCEED FURTHER AND FASTER THAN WE WOULD LIKE.
3465|AN OFFICE INFORMATION SYSTEM DESIGN STUDY.     DESCRIBES A STUDY UNDERTAKEN IN THE SUMMER OF 1979| OF THE ADMISSIONS OFFICE OFQUEEN MARY COLLEGE, UNIVERSITY OF LONDON. ITS PURPOSES WERE' TO PROVIDE ABETTER FEEL FOR THE TASKS AND PROBLEMS OF OFFICE INFORMATION PROCESSING; TODEVELOP METHODS FOR DESCRIBING OFFICES AND THE PROCEDURES EMPLOYED TO PROCESSOFFICE INFORMATION AND TO IDENTIFY USEFUL INDICATORS OF OFFICE EFFECTIVENESS;AND TO CREATE A DATA BASE OF PROCEDURE DESCRIPTIONS FROM WHICH A DESIGN FOR ANEXPERIMENTAL COMPUTER BASED SYSTEM COULD BE DRAWN AND TESTED FOR FUNCTIONALCOMPLETENESS. INTRODUCES PROBLEMS THAT DESIGNERS OF THE ELECTRONIC OFFICE MUSTCONSIDER AND SUGGESTS SOLUTIONS.

EXPECIALLY CONSIDERED ARE DEVELOPMENTS IN MICROFILM, DATA- AND TEXTPROCESSING AND GENERAL OFFICE TECHNOLOGY.
3468|BRITISH RAIL'S ADMINISTRATIVE COMMUNICATIONS STRATEGY.     DESCRIBES A STUDY INITIATED IN 1976| BY BRITISH RAIL TO EXAMINE WHAT AND HOWINFORMATION WAS PROCESSED, OPTIONS AVAILABLE, AND TO DESIGN AN ADMINISTRATIVECOMMUNICATIONS STRATEGY. THE OBJECTIVES WERE' INCREASED PRODUCTIVITY; COSTREDUCTION, AVOIDANCE AND CONTROL; IMPROVED QUALITY OF SERVICE TO THEFUNCTIONS; IMPROVED WORK ENVIRONMENT; AND IMPROVED MANAGEMENT COMMUNICATIONSAND CONTROL. DESCRIBES THE REASONS FOR A STRATEGY TO BE ESTABLISHED, AND AIMSAND BENEFITS OF ADOPTING SUCH A STRATEGY WHICH WILL EVENTUALLY PROVIDE FORCONVERGENCE OF TEXT AND DATA SYSTEMS AND FOR HIGH SPEED COMMUNICATIONS ANDELECTRONIC MAILING BETWEEN ALL MAJOR BR LOCATIONS.
3469|THE MICROWRITER.     CURRENTLY THE MICROWRITER IS THE FOUNDATION FOR A NEW WAY OF WRITING IN ALMOSTANY ENVIRONMENT, WITH ONLY 1| HAND, AND WITH THE CAPACITY AND CAPABILITY OFBEING ABLE TO STORE, RETRIEVE, EDIT, FORMAT AND TRANSMIT WRITTEN INFORMATIONEITHER AS THE PRINTED WORD, OR IN CONVERTIBLE MACHINE LANGUAGE. SEPARATED FROMTHE MICROWRITER, THE 5| FINGER KEYBOARD COULD BE FITTED TO CONVENTIONALEQUIPMENT, SUCH AS TYPEWRITERS, WORD PROCESSING UNITS, TELEX AND COMPUTERS,GIVING ACCESS TO NUMEROUS PEOPLE WHO HAVE THE AUTHORITY AND NEED TOCOMMUNICATE DIRECTLY WITH THE EQUIPMENT, BUT ARE UNABLE TO MASTER THEOPERATION OF THE QWERTY KEYBOARD EFFICIENTLY! IN THESE CASES THE MICROWRITERKEYBOARD WILL BE A PERIPHERAL IN ADDITION TO THE NORMAL KEYBOARD, AND THECHARACTERISTICS OF THE EQUIPMENT WILL OPERATE IN THE NORMAL WAY.
3470|A STUDY OF THE ARMY'S WORD PROCESSING PROGRAM WITH CASES.     DEMONSTRATES POTENTIAL ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES THAT COULD RESULT FROM THEIMPLEMENTATION OF A WORD PROCESSING/ADMINISTRATIVE SUPPORT SYSTEM. A MODEL ISPRESENTED ON PLANNING, IMPLEMENTING, AND MAINTAINING A WORDPROCESSING/ADMINISTRATIVE SUPPORT SYSTEM. A COMPARISON IS MADE OF THE GUIDANCECONTAINED IN AR 340|-8| AND THE GUIDANCE CONTAINED IN THE CURRENT WORDPROCESSING LITERATURE AS PERTAINS TO THE ACTIVITIES PRESENTED IN THE MODEL.
3471|VISUAL ASPECTS OF THE ELECTRONIC OFFICE.     SOME OF THE VISUAL TASKS INVOLVED IN USING A VDT DIFFER IN KIND FROM THOSEENCOUNTERED IN A TRADITIONAL OFFICE. THE SELF-LUMINOUS NATURE OF THE SCREENCHARACTERS AND THE 3| TASK AREAS OF SOURCE MATERIAL, KEYBOARD AND SCREENPRESENT A CHALLENGE TO THE LIGHTING DESIGNER AND ERGONOMIST. SUITABLECOMBINATIONS OF LIGHT SOURCE AND LUMINAIRE AND THE RELATIVE LOCATIONS OF ALLTHE ELEMENTS INVOLVED CAN PROVIDE ACCEPTABLE SOLUTIONS BUT DUE RECOGNITIONSHOULD BE PAID TO THE OPHTHALMIC REQUIREMENTS OF OPERATORS.
3472|DISPLAY TECHNOLOGIES FOR OFFICE SYSTEMS.     CONSIDERS THE REQUIREMENTS FOR AN IDEAL OFFICE DISPLAY AND COMPARES CRT(CATHODE RAY TUBES) WITH MATRIX DISPLAYS TO SEE HOW CLOSELY THEY CAN MEETREQUIREMENTS. THE CRT CAN MEET THE DISPLAY FUNCTION REQUIREMENTS BUT IS NOTIDEAL IN SPACE TAKEN, POWER AND WEIGHT. NO OTHER DISPLAY TECHNOLOGY CAN MEETTHE RANGE OF FUNCTION REQUIRED BUT THEY HAVE ATTRACTIONS IN SIZE AND SHAPE ANDAS TECHNOLOGIES IMPROVE MAY MEET THE FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS.
3473|DISPLAY SYSTEMS IN THE ELECTRONIC OFFICE.     DESCRIBES 2| RESEARCH PROJECTS BASED IN THE COMPUTER SYSTEMS LABORATORY ATQUEEN MARY COLLEGE, UNIVERSITY OF LONDON. ONE PROJECT, ALREADY COMPLETED, HASPRODUCED A NEW PIECE OF HARDWARE-THE 'Q.M.C. TEXT TERMINAL'-WHICH IS A DISPLAYSYSTEM INCORPORATING 2| PROCESSORS WHICH ARE ENTIRELY DEVOTED TO PROVIDING AHIGHLY USER-ORIENTED DISPLAY OF TEXTUAL INFORMATION. THE OTHER PROJECT, STILLIN PROGRESS, AIMS TO DEVELOP A RADICALLY NEW DISPLAY PROCESSOR TECHNOLOGY, THEHOPE BEING THAT IT WILL INCREASE SIGNIFICANTLY THE SPEED OF IMAGE GENERATIONIN BITMAP DISPLAY SYSTEMS.
3474|TELECOMMUNICATIONS IN THE ELECTRONIC OFFICE.     THE WORK STATION OF THE EXECUTIVE OF THE FUTURE WILL EVOLVE FROM THECOMMUNICATING WORD PROCESSOR (CWP) AND WILL INCORPORATE THE BASIC FACILITIESPROVIDED BY THE CWP FOR INPUT, TEXT DISPLAY, TEXT MANIPULATION, HARD COPYOUTPUT AND COMMUNICATION. THE ENHANCEMENT OF THESE FACILITIES WILL RESULT FROMTHE ADDITION OF FEATURES CURRENTLY FOUND IN STAND ALONE DEVICES. DESCRIBESSOME OF THE MORE LIKELY DEVELOPMENTS THAT WILL EMERGE FOR INPUT, STORAGE ANDOUTPUT. ALSO DISCUSSES COMMUNICATION AND NETWORK SERVICES AND STANDARDISATION.
3475|THE EXTENSION OF COMPUTER INTELLIGENCE.     THE RATE OF TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE WILL BE ACCELERATED BY THE DEVELOPMENT OFMICROPROCESSORS. FURTHER DEVELOPMENT WILL LEAD TO THE INTEGRATION ANDEXTENSION OF MANY OF THE TOOLS OF TODAY. A COROLLARY OF THIS WILL BE THAT THEINTELLIGENCE OF THE LARGE COMPUTERS WILL NOW APPEAR IN OTHER ITEMS OFEQUIPMENT WITHIN THE OFFICE ENVIRONMENT.
3476|JUSTIFYING THE ELECTRONIC OFFICE-THE NEED FOR AN 'ADDED VALUE' APPROACH.     SUGGESTS THAT EMPHASIS ON THE COST-SAVING ELEMENTS OF OFFICE AUTOMATION CANHAVE AN OVERALL NEGATIVE EFFECT ON ENTERPRISE OR ORGANISATION, AND DISCUSSESSOME APPROACHES TO AN 'ADDED VALUE' APPROACH, INCLUDING REQUIREMENTS OFANALYSIS AND JUSTIFICATION, ANALYSIS OF MANAGERIAL WORK, CONCEPT OF PLANNEDSUPPORT LEVELS AND 'DELIVERED SERVICE' JUSTIFICATION.
3477|A NEW CONCEPT FOR THE DESIGN OF A FLEXIBLE OFFICE SYSTEM.     PRESENTS OFFICE AUTOMATION SYSTEMS AS AN APPLICATION OF MICROPROCESSOR BASEDSYSTEMS. THE SMALL SIZE, LOW COST, AND REASONABLY HIGH POWER OF THESE SYSTEMSENABLED THEIR USE IN AUTOMATING SOME OFFICE TASKS. PRESENTS A GENERALDESCRIPTION OF A TYPICAL MICROPROCESSOR BASED OFFICE AUTOMATION SYSTEM, THENDISCUSSES THE PROBLEMS ARISING IN THE DESIGN, IMPLEMENTATION, AND USE OF SUCHSYSTEMS. PROPOSES A SCHEME FOR PARTITIONING AND MODULARISING THE HARDWARE ANDSOFTWARE OF THE SYSTEM, TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THE SOLUTION OF SOMEPROBLEMS OF COMPATIBILITY, PORTABILITY AND SYSTEM EXTENSIBILITY. THE PROPOSEDSYSTEM CAN BE USED AS A UNIVERSAL BASIC CORE ON WHICH ONE CAN EASILY BUILDLARGER WORD PROCESSING SYSTEMS. THE USER CAN, BY HIMSELF, EXTEND HIS SYSTEM BYUSING THE SAME WORD PROCESSING LANGUAGE HE USES EVERYDAY BECAUSE OF ITSSPECIAL PROPERTIES PRESENTED HERE. THE SYSTEM IS ALSO SIMPLY RECONFIGURABLE ATTHE WILL OF THE USER TO EXACTLY FI T HIS NEEDS AT ANY TIME.
3478|SCRAPBOOK-A GENERAL PURPOSE INFORMATION HANDLING SYSTEM.     THE ELECTRONIC OFFICE OF THE FUTURE WILL REQUIRE A SOPHISTICATED INFORMATIONHANDLING FRAMEWORK ON WHICH TO BASE SUCH FACILITIES AS ELECTRONIC MAIL,FACSIMILE TRANSMISSION AND WORD PROCESSING. SCRAPBOOK REPRESENTS AN EARLYSTAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF SUCH A SYSTEM. IT PROVIDES FACILITIES FORINFORMATION RETRIEVAL, ELECTRONIC MAIL AND WORD PROCESSING, AND MAY BE READILYADAPTED TO INCORPORATE MORE SPECIALISED FACILITIES FOR PARTICULAR USERS. THEEMPHASIS IS ON FLEXIBILITY, SO THAT CHANGING USER REQUIREMENTS MAY BE MET WITHLITTLE OR NO REPROGRAMMING EFFORT.
3479|PROCEEDINGS OF THE CONFERENCE ON THE ELECTRONIC OFFICE' THE LONDON PENTAHOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND, TUESDAY 22|ND TO FRIDAY 25|TH APRIL 1980|.     PROCEEDINGS OF A CONFERENCE ORGANISED BY THE INSTITUTION OF ELECTRONIC ANDRADIO ENGINEERS ON THE ELECTRONIC OFFICE, IN ASSOCIATION WITH THE INSTITUTIONOF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERS, THE INSTITUTE OF ELECTRICAL AND ELECTRONICSENGINEERS, THE CHARTERED INSTITUTION OF BUILDING SERVICES AND THE BRITISHCOMPUTER SOCIETY, LONDON, 22|-25| APR 80|. FOR ABSTRACTS OF THE INDIVIDUALPAPERS, 2|SEE1| THE FOLLOWING SERIAL NUMBERS'.

3486|AUTOMATION OF A MILITARY COMMUNICATION CENTRE.     IN MILITARY OPERATIONS SECURE COMMUNICATIONS ARE REQUIRED TO ENSURE THATINFORMATION IS TRANSFERRED SECURELY, ACCURATELY AND PROMPTLY FROM ORIGINATORTO ADDRESSEE. MESSAGE SWITCHING SYSTEMS HAVE IMPROVED MESSAGE AND DATAHANDLING, THEREBY REDUCING TRANSIT TIMES TO A FEW MINUTES; HOWEVER, WITHINCOMMUNICATION CENTRES (COMCENS), MESSAGES ARE STILL HANDLED MANUALLY ANDDELAYS OFTEN OCCUR. THE SOLUTION LIES IN THE AUTOMATION OF COMCEN ACTIVITIESAND THE PROVISION OF DIRECT COMMUNICATIONS WITH INDIVIDUAL USERS. CONSIDERSAUTOMATION IN TERMS OF PRESENT DAY TECHNOLOGY, AND ANALYSES THE MANUALOPERATIONAL PROCEDURES AND THE FUNCTIONAL MESSAGE FLOW THROUGH THE COMCEN TOTHE USERS.
3487|WRITING EFFECTIVE REPORTS.     THE RESEARCH APPLICATION AND INFORMATION GROUP'S COURSE ON REPORT WRITING ISDESIGNED TO HELP NTRR'S AUTHORS BECOME BETTER WRITERS BY GIVING THEMSTRAIGHT-FORWARD RULES FOR BETTER STYLE, AND BY ENCOURAGING THEM TO CRITICISEAND REVISE THEIR OWN WORK.
3488|TYPEWRITTEN TEXTS AND TYPEWRITING' SOME POINTS ARISING FROM A DISCUSSION ONFORMULATING A BIBLIOLOGICAL APPROACH.     A REPORT OF A FORUM HELD IN OCT 80| BY THE FRENCH INSTITUTE FOR THE STUDY OFTHE BOOK, SPONSORED BY THE MINISTRY OF EDUCATION, TO CONSIDER THE IMPLICATIONSOF GENERAL USE OF TYPEWRITERS FOR TEACHING IN COMMERCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND FORINFORMATICS; AND THE ECONOMIC, SOCIAL AND CULTURAL CONSEQUENCES WORLDWIDE,PRESENT AND FUTURE. THE DEVELOPMENT OF TYPEWRITERS FROM THEIR INVENTION UP TOTHE PRESENT IS TRACED, IN RELATION TO THE CONSEQUENCES IN THE ORGANISATION ANDADMINISTRATION OF OFFICE WORK AND PERSONNEL DEPLOYMENT. THE INTRODUCTION OFSOPHISTICATED MACHINES WHICH DISPENSE WITH TRADITIONAL OPERATORS IS CONSIDEREDAND THE POTENTIAL CONSEQUENCES FOR PUBLISHING METHODS AND INFORMATIONCOMMUNICATION TECHNIQUES SURVEYED. IN CONCLUSION, IT IS DEBATED WHETHERBIBLIOLOGY MIGHT BECOME OUTMODED IN THE NEAR FUTURE. AN APPENDIX LISTS THEPAPERS PRESENTED AT THE FORUM.
