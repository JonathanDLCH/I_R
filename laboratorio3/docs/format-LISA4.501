4551|THE SUPPORT OF ADULT EDUCATION AND TRAINING.     THE ARRIVAL OF NEW PLANT AT THE PETROCHEMICAL COMBINE AT SCHWEDT MEANT THATRETRAINING FOR SOME STAFF AND MORE ADVANCED TRAINING FOR OTHERS HAD TO BECARRIED OUT.

SOME HOSPITALS ARE STILL WITHOUT PATIENTS' LIBRARIES AND EVERYEFFORT IS BEING MADE TO IMPROVE THE SERVICE AND RELATIONSHIPS WITH MEDICALSTAFF. IT IS IMPORTANT TO SELECT STOCK THAT WILL ASSIST RECOVERY; REGULARDISCUSSIONS ARE HELD ON SUITABLE MATERIAL. THE ARRANGEMENT AND APPEARANCE OFPATIENTS' LIBRARIES ARE VERY IMPORTANT; OLD HOSPITAL BUILDINGS ARE OFTENWITHOUT SUITABLE PREMISES FOR A LIBRARY. IN NEW BUILDINGS A LIBRARY ROOM ISALWAYS PROVIDED. IN MANY HOSPITALS THE PATIENTS' LIBRARY IS AMALGAMATED WITHTHE TRADE UNION LIBRARY, SO THAT EXTRA FINANCE AND STAFF ARE AVAILABLE.

OUTLINES RULES FOR LANGUAGE AND LAY-OUTWHICH MAKE A BOOK EASIER TO READ AND THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF BOOK AIMED ATDIFFERENT GROUPS ('ORDINARY' BOOKS, EASY READERS, MAGNAPRINT, BRAILLE, SPOKENBOOKS, BOOK 0| TAPE). THIS KIND OF MATERIAL IS GIVEN TOO LITTLE PRIORITY BYPUBLISHERS AND LIBRARIES. SPECIAL CARE SHOULD BE TAKEN IN DESIGN OF LIBRARIESTO MAKE THEM ACCESSIBLE TO THE HANDICAPPED. THE LIBRARY MUST DISSEMINATE ITSSERVICES WIDELY TO THE HANDICAPPED. DURING THE INTERNATIONAL YEAR IT ISIMPORTANT THAT LIBRARIES MAKE A SPECIAL  EFFORT AND ARE REPRESENTED ON LOCALORGANISING COMMITTEES.

4558|CONSIDERING THE DISABLED IN SCHOOL LIBRARIES' ATTITUDES AND LIBRARY DESIGN.     WITH THE INTRODUCTION AND INCREASING PREVALENCE OF MAINSTREAMING IN SCHOOLS,IT IS INEVITABLE THAT SOME STUDENTS WILL HAVE TO COPE WITH SOME DEGREE OFDISABILITY. DISABILITIES VARY TREMENDOUSLY, BOTH IN TYPE AND DEGREE TO WHICHNORMAL FUNCTIONING IS IMPAIRED. IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT ALL STUDENTS BE GIVEN THESAME CONSIDERATION AND RESPECT REGARDLESS OF INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES.LIBRARIANS CAN CONTRIBUTE MOST BY UNDERSTANDING THE SPECIAL DIFFICULTIES ANDNEEDS OF THE CHILD. ABILITIES RATHER THAN DISABILITIES NEED TO BE EMPHASISED.BESIDES PSYCHOLOGICAL AND SOCIAL BARRIERS, THE PROBLEM OF SIMPLE PHYSICALACCESS MUST BE CONSIDERED. DESIGN FEATURES THAT MUST BE CONSIDERED INCLUDEACCESS TO THE BUILDING, ACCESS WITHIN THE LIBRARY AND ACCESS TO ALL LIBRARYSERVICES.
4559|LIBRARY SERVICES TO PHYSICALLY DISABLED PERSONS.     THE INTERNATIONAL YEAR FOR DISABLED PERSONS 1981| HAS DRAWN THE ATTENTION TOTHE 8|% OF THE WORLD POPULATION WHO ARE DISABLED IN SOME WAY. CONSIDERABLEATTENTION HAS BEEN GIVEN TO THE LIBRARY NEEDS OF THESE PEOPLE. IN ORDER TOOFFER THEM EQUAL RIGHTS AND EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES AS ABLE PERSONS IN THELIBRARY, SEVERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR THE PHYSICAL LAY-OUT AND EQUIPMENT SHOULD BECONSIDERED. BLIND PERSONS HAVE A WELL-COORDINATED SOUTH AFRICAN LIBRARYSERVICE WITH BOOKS IN BRAILLE OR MOON PRINT AND BOOKS ON TAPE AT THEIRDISPOSAL. ALMOST ALL OTHER DISABLED PERSONS CAN RELY WITH CONFIDENCE ON THESERVICE OF THEIR NEARBY LIBRARY. SPECIAL ATTEMPTS WILL BE MADE TO SUPPLY THEMWITH BOOKS, IN GENERAL AS WELL AS AIMED AT THEIR SPECIFIC NEEDS. E.G. HOW TOADAPT TO THEIR WAY OF LIVING AS DISABLED PERSONS (DEALING WITH THE PRACTICALASPECTS LIKE CLOTHING AND HOUSING) AND HOW TO ACCEPT REALITY (HEALING OF THEMIND).

THE BASIC THEMEWAS DISCUSSED WITH REFERENCE TO INDIVIDUAL COUNTRIES IN AFRICA, ASIA AND LATINAMERICA, WHERE MANY CHILDREN ATTEND SCHOOL ONLY BRIEFLY OR NOT AT ALL, SO THEYREMAIN ILLITERATE. MANY PARENTS ARE ALSO ILLITERATE SO READING IN LEISUREHOURS IS NOT ENCOURAGED. WHAT SCHOOL BOOKS AND LESSONS THERE ARE EXIST ONLY INAN OFFICIAL LANGUAGE, GENERALLY THAT OF A COLONISING POWER. THERE IS A LACK OFPUBLISHED MATERIAL IN LOCAL LANGUAGES, SOME OF WHICH HAVE NEVER EVEN BEENWRITTEN DOWN. IN THESE COUNTRIES A LIBRARY NETWORK MUST BE ESTABLISHED AND THEGROWTH OF READING ENCOURAGED WITH THE HELP OF PROFESSIONAL AND VOLUNTARYSTAFF. LIBRARY SERVICE FOR THE HANDICAPPED POSE SPECIAL PROBLEMS.

SINCE THE 1970|S 46| PUBLIC LIBRARIES HAVE BEENOPENED, EACH OF WHICH CONTAINS A CHILDREN'S DEPARTMENT. KEYPOINTS IN THEDEVELOPMENT OF CHILDREN'S LIBRARIES ARE THE PRODUCTION OF SUITABLE LITERATURE,STOCK EXPANSION AND STAFF TRAINING, A PROGRAMME COORDINATED BY THE CENTRALLIBRARY FOR CHILDREN'S LITERATURE IN BAMAKO. LIBRARIANS, AUTHORS ANDPUBLISHERS ARE WORKING TOGETHER TO MAKE COLLECTIONS OF NATIONAL LEGENDS ANDSTORIES, ORGANISE CULTURAL EVENTS AND ENCOURAGE LIBRARY USE.

4573|AN INTEGRATED PUBLIC/SCHOOLS LIBRARY SYSTEM FOR MALTA.     (FLA THESIS.) PROVIDES A PLAN TO STANDARDISE DEVELOPMENT IN THESTATE-CONTROLLED PUBLIC AND SCHOOL LIBRARIES IN MALTA, OVER A 10|-YEAR PERIOD,IN LIGHT OF THE FAILURE OF THE 7|-YEAR MALTA DEVELOPMENT PLAN TO MENTIONLIBRARY DEVELOPMENT. STRESSES THE FACT THAT MALTA HAS A SUFFICIENTLY WELLEDUCATED AND APPRECIATIVE POPULATION TO EMBARK ON SUCH A PROGRAMME OFINTEGRATED SERVICE AND PROVISION.
4574|SCHOOL LIBRARIES-A DREAM OF THE 1970|S.     EDUCATIONAL REFORM CANNOT TAKE PLACE WITHOUT THE INCLUSION OF THE BASICCULTURAL TECHNOLOGY. PARTICULAR SUCCESS IN THIS FIELD HAS BEEN SHOWN IN THE 3|COMBINED SCHOOL AND PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN HANOVER, WHICH CONTAINS A WIDE RANGEOF MATERIAL AND EQUIPMENT FOR CLASS AND INDIVIDUAL STUDY AND FOR LEISUREACTIVITIES. IF PURCHASING, PROCESSING AND CONTROL OF SCHOOL LIBRARY MEDIASTOCKS ARE TO BE INTEGRATED INTO CENTRALISED PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVICES, THERIGHT TO FINANCIAL PROVISION MUST BE GUARANTEED. MORE CLARITY IS NEEDEDREGARDING THE CALCULATION OF PROCESSING COSTS; STAFFING COSTS SHOULD BE BORNEBY LOCAL GOVERNMENT, MATERIAL AND BINDING COSTS BY THE SCHOOLS. SOME PROBLEMSCONCERNING THE ORGANISATION OF USE PROCEDURES, E.G. TICKET WRITING AND FINECOLLECTION, REMAIN UNSOLVED.
4575|THE MINISTER HAS BEEN LED ASTRAY.     THE CONTRIBUTION BY A MEMBER OF THE DANISH LIBRARY ASSOCIATION'S EXECUTIVECOMMITTEE TO A DEBATE ON SCHOOL LIBRARIES HELD AT THE DANISH SCHOOL LIBRARYASSOCIATION'S ANNUAL MEETING, OCT 81|. ARGUES THAT THE MINISTRY OF CULTURE INITS LIBRARY BILL HAS DISREGARDED THE LIBRARY COMMISSION'S PROPOSALS FOR SCHOOLLIBRARIES. ALTHOUGH RESEARCH LIBRARIES WERE NOT INCLUDED IN THE 1964| LIBRARYACT, A UNIFIED LIBRARY SYSTEM WAS BROUGHT ABOUT WITH THE INCLUSION OF SCHOOLLIBRARIES. THE IDEAL OF UNITY IS NOW BEING SET ASIDE. BUT IF THE SCHOOLLIBRARIES ARE TO BE TRANSFERRED TO THE SCHOOLS, THE MINIMUM DEMAND TO ENSURETHEIR EXISTENCE MUST BE BY-LAWS GOVERNING THEIR RELATIONSHIP TO PUBLICLIBRARIES AND A SEPARATE BUDGET. THESE REQUIREMENTS WERE CONFIRMED BY THEMINISTER OF CULTURE. YET THE LIBRARY BILL MAKES NO MENTION OF THEM AND REDUCESTHE SEPARATE BUDGET TO AN ACCOUNTING ITEM IN THE LOCAL AUTHORITY FINANCES. THEBILL IS, THEREFORE, TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE TO THE DANISH LI BRARY ASSOCIATION.
4576|SCHOOL LIBRARIES IN LOWER SAXONY.     LECTURE GIVEN TO THE CONFERENCE OF LIBRARIANS IN LOWER SAXONY, CELLE, APR 81|.SINCE 1979| THE SCHOOL LIBRARY CENTRE IN HANOVER HAS PROVIDED CENTRALISEDPURCHASING, PROCESSING AND ADVISORY SERVICES FOR THE SCHOOL LIBRARIES IN ITSAREA. THE QUESTION AS TO WHETHER SCHOOL LIBRARIES SHOULD BE RUN BY LIBRARIANSOR TEACHERS IS STILL DISPUTED. SCHOOL LIBRARIES ARE PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT IN'THE REFORMED GRAMMAR SCHOOL, WHERE THEY PROMOTE INDEPENDENT STUDY ANDCOOPERATION BETWEEN TEACHERS AND PUPILS; SCHOOLS OPEN ALL DAY, WHERE THELIBRARY BECOMES A COMMUNICATION CENTRE CATERING FOR LEISURE AS WELL ASACADEMIC ACTIVITY; VOCATIONAL TRAINING SCHOOLS, WHERE THEY CATER FOR STUDENTSFROM ALL LEVELS OF SECONDARY EDUCATION, PROVIDE SPECIAL HELP FOR FOREIGNSTUDENTS WITH LANGUAGE PROBLEMS AND DEVELOP POSSIBILITIES FOR JOB FLEXIBILITY.CLEAR, PREFERABLY BINDING, REGULATIONS ON COOPERATION BETWEEN SCHOOL ANDPUBLIC LIBRARIES ARE NEEDED.
4577|THE DEVELOPMENT OF SCHOOL LIBRARIES IN THE CZECHOSLOVAK SOCIALIST REPUBLIC.     SCHOOL LIBRARIES IN CZECHOSLOVAKIA CAME TO LIFE AT THE BEGINNING OF THE LASTCENTURY, BUT THEIR FULL DEVELOPMENT BEGAN AFTER WORLD WAR II.

4578|DANISH SCHOOL LIBRARY ASSOCIATION ANNUAL MEETING 1981|.     REPORT OF A PAPER GIVEN AT THE 1981| ANNUAL MEETING OF DENMARK'S SCHOOL LIBRARYASSOCIATION BY LISE OSTERGAARD. THE CONTROVERSY OVER THE TRANSFER OFRESPONSIBILITY FOR DANISH SCHOOL LIBRARIES TO THE MINISTRY OF EDUCATION FROMTHE MINISTRY OF CULTURE IS REVIEWED. IT IS THE TASK OF THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES,HOWEVER, TO ENSURE THE OPERATION AND DEVELOPMENT OF PUBLIC AND SCHOOLLIBRARIES, SO THAT THEY WORK TOGETHER IN PROMOTING CULTURAL, INFORMATIONAL ANDEDUCATIONAL ACTIVITIES. THE CHANGE IN THE LAW GOVERNING SCHOOL LIBRARIES IS ASTEP FORWARD, STRENGTHENING COOPERATION BETWEEN THE VARIOUS TYPES OF LIBRARYCONTROLLED BY CENTRAL GOVERNMENT AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES. PRODUCTION OF BOOKSFOR CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE IS IMPORTANT AND HAS INCREASED GREATLY INDENMARK OVER THE LAST 10|-20| YEARS, LARGELY DUE TO THE EXPANSION OF CHILDREN'SLIBRARIES. 80|% OF ALL DANISH CHILDREN'S BOOKS ARE PURCHASED BY PUBLIC, SCHOOLAND INSTITUTIONAL LIBRARIES. THE FUT URE OF SUCH BOOKS DEPENDS ON THEWILLINGNESS OF LOCAL AUTHORITIES, IN SPITE OF BUDGETARY PROBLEMS, TO PROVIDEYOUNG PEOPLE WITH A BROAD RANGE OF LITERATURE.
4579|SCHOOL LIBRARIES AND BASIC EDUCATION IN FIRST AND SECOND GRADE SCHOOLS IN THESTATE OF SAO PAULO, BRAZIL.     DISCUSSES THE ROLE OF THE LIBRARY IN ELEMENTARY AND JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOLS ASPRESCRIBED BY BRAZILIAN STATE LEGISLATION, AND SUGGESTS CLOSER INTEGRATION OFSCHOOL AND LIBRARY TASKS. DETAILS ARE GIVEN OF THE STRUCTURE OF SCHOOLORGANISATION, WHICH ASSIGNS THE LIBRARY TO THE CATEGORY OF TECHNICAL SUPPORTFOR TEACHING PROGRAMMES AND DESIGNATES IT AN EXTRA-CURRICULAR ACTIVITY.CRITICISES THIS AS AN INADEQUATE CONCEPTION OF THE LIBRARY'S ROLE, AND ARGUESFOR ACTIVE COLLABORATION IN THE TEACHING PROCESS, AS A BACK-UP MULTI-MEDIARESOURCE CENTRE. EXAMINES THE OFFICIAL FUNCTIONS OF THE LIBRARY, AND SHOWS HOWINSUFFICIENT RESOURCES ARE PROVIDED FOR THE FULFILMENT OF EVEN ITS NOMINALTASKS. IN CONCLUSION A RESTRUCTURING OF THE SCHOOL SYSTEM IS PROPOSED,PERMITTING TOTAL INTEGRATION OF LIBRARY AND TEACHING PROGRAMMES AT ALL LEVELS.

STRESSES THE NEED FOR ARECOGNITION OF THE VALUE OF RESOURCE-BASED EDUCATION, AND SUGGESTS A STRATEGYFOR CHANGE, PROPOSALS FOR A COURSE FOR TEACHER-LIBRARIANS, AND RECOMMENDATIONSFOR SCHOOL LIBRARY STANDARDS.
4582|THE TEACHER AND THE MEDIA CENTRE-PROBLEMS AND DISTURBANCES IN USE.     THE FUNCTIONS AND ORGANISATION OF SCHOOL LIBRARIES/MEDIA CENTRES ASINDISPENSIBLE PREREQUISITES FOR THE REALISATION OF EDUCATIONAL AIMS HAVE BEENDISCUSSED SINCE THE 1970|S, BUT LIBRARIANS' HIGH EXPECTATIONS HAVE GENERALLYNOT BEEN REALISED. EVEN IN COMPREHENSIVE SCHOOLS, MEDIA CENTRES ARE STILL ONLYON THE FRINGE OF SCHOOL LIFE. THE USE OF A MEDIA CENTRE AS A FOCAL POINT OFSCHOOL ACTIVITIES DEMANDS RADICAL CHANGES IN SCHOOL STRUCTURE AND THETEACHER'S ROLE. MANY OF THE MEDIA PROVIDED ARE UNSUITED TO THE SCHOOL LEARNINGSITUATION. TEACHERS HAVE TO SPEND MUCH TIME PLANNING THE DEVELOPMENT OFINDEPENDENT STUDY PROGRAMMES; CLOSE COOPERATION WITH SCHOOL LIBRARIANS WOULDPROVE HELPFUL HERE. ADMINISTRATION OF CENTRALLY STORED MEDIA IS EFFECTIVE ANDECONOMICAL BUT SINCE MUCH TIME IS WASTED WHEN CHILDREN MOVE BETWEEN CLASSROOMAND MEDIA CENTRE, FLEXIBLE TIMETABLES SHOULD BE DEVELOPED.
4583|A DAY IN THE MEDIA CENTRE AT THE BUDENBERG SCHOOL, HAIGER.     THE SCHOOL CATERS FOR ABOUT 90| EDUCATIONALLY SUBNORMAL CHILDREN. THE MEDIACENTRE IS RUN BY TEACHERS WITH AN ASSISTANT ON CIVILIAN SERVICE DUTY; IT ISHOUSED IN A MULTI-PURPOSE ROOM OF ABOUT 300| SQ. M. THE CENTRE OPENS AT 7|.30|A.M. SO THAT CHILDREN CAN USE IT FOR LEISURE AND READING ACTIVITIES UNTILLESSONS START AT 8| A.M. THE CENTRE CONTAINS BOOKS, WITH AN EMPHASIS ONPICTORIAL MATERIAL, RECORDS, VIDEO GAMES AND CASSETTES.

DURING AFTERNOONS AND EVENINGS THE CENTRE IS USEDFOR CONFERENCES, PARENTS' MEETINGS AND SENIOR CITIZENS' ACTIVITIES.
4584|HAS THE DISCUSSION ABOUT SCHOOL LIBRARIES FINISHED?.     SINCE THE EARLY 19|TH CENTURY, THE VALUE OF A CENTRALLY SITUATED SCHOOL LIBRARYOPEN TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC AND ENCOURAGING A LIFE-LONG LEARNING PROCESS HASBEEN WIDELY DISCUSSED. THE DISCUSSION RECEIVED FRESH IMPETUS AFTER 1970| WITHTHE DEVELOPMENT OF USA, UK AND SCANDINAVIAN SCHOOL MEDIA CENTRES AND RENEWEDINTEREST IN THE SOCIAL AND EDUCATIONAL FUNCTIONS OF SCHOOL LIBRARIES.CLASSROOMS MUST BE CLOSELY CONNECTED WITH THE SCHOOL MEDIA CENTRE; THEIREVOLUTION INTO CLASS MEDIA CENTRES HAS ONLY OCCURRED SO FAR IN PRIMARYSCHOOLS, A CHANGE DEMANDING GOOD ORGANISATION AND CLOSE LINKS WITH THE PUBLICLIBRARY SYSTEM. THE TRIANGULAR RELATIONSHIP CLASSROOM-SCHOOL MEDIACENTRE-PUBLIC LIBRARY CAN BE EQUATED WITH EMUNDS' '3|-TIER' LIBRARY SYSTEM;EACH COMPONENT MUST HAVE ITS TASKS CLEARLY DEFINED.

THE LIBRARIAN AT A BRANCH LIBRARY IN POTSDAM WORKS CLOSELY WITH TEACHERS ATTHE SPECIAL SCHOOL NEARBY, DISCUSSING SUITABLE LIBRARY MATERIAL AND ARRANGINGSPECIAL EVENTS SUCH AS AUTHORS' VISITS. CHILDREN FROM THE LOWER FORMS AREBROUGHT INTO THE LIBRARY TO SAMPLE THE BOOKS AND LEARN ABOUT THE LIBRARYSERVICE; THE CHILDREN ENJOY THEIR VISITS AND OFTEN RETURN AGAIN DURING LEISUREHOURS. STOCKS MOST USEFUL TO THEM ARE LARGE PRINT BOOKS AND PICTORIALMATERIAL. THE LIBRARIAN HAS ACQUIRED A GOOD KNOWLEDGE OF INDIVIDUAL READERSAND THEIR INTERESTS. THROUGH CLOSE COOPERATION WITH OTHER LIBRARIES,HANDICAPPED READERS FROM OTHER AREAS OFTEN COME TO USE THIS LIBRARY. GOODCONTACTS WITH PARENTS ARE ALSO VALUABLE; A MEETING IS PLANNED TO INTRODUCEPARENTS TO LITERATURE ON DIFFERENT KINDS OF HANDICAP.
4587|THE AFRICAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION OF SOUTH AFRICA-ITS ROLE ON THE BLACK LIBRARYSCENE.     THE AFRICAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION OF SOUTH AFRICA HAS BEEN IN EXISTENCE FOR 17|YEARS. DURING THIS PERIOD IT HAS CONCERNED ITSELF WITH THE PROMOTION OF THEREADING HABIT AMONG BLACKS AND WITH THE UPGRADING OF THE QUALITY OF PERSONSENGAGED IN LIBRARY WORK BY MEANS OF VACATION SCHOOLS AND SEMINARS. IT HAS MADEREPRESENTATIONS TO LOCAL AUTHORITIES AND THE GOVERNMENT AND ALL THOSECONCERNED WITH THE PROVISION OF LIBRARY SERVICES FOR BLACKS, EITHER TO STARTLIBRARY SERVICES WHERE THESE WERE NOT IN EXISTENCE OR TO IMPROVE THE EXISTINGONES FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE LOCAL INHABITANTS.
4588|PUBLIC LIBRARY NEEDS FOR BLACKS' A PERSONAL VIEW.     IN SOUTH AFRICA IT OFTEN IS ALLEGED THAT BLACKS REQUIRE THE PUBLIC LIBRARY TOOFFER SERVICES BY WHICH THEY CAN ADVANCE THEIR KNOWLEDGE AND CAPABILITIES. ONTHE MASLOW PYRAMID THIS COULD BE CONSIDERED A NEED AT THE BASIC LEVEL, WHILETHE READING OF RECREATIVE WORKS COULD BE CONSIDERED TO LIE AT A HIGHER LEVEL.IN FACT IT IS FOUND THAT 72|% OF BOOKS BORROWED BY BLACKS CONSIST OF FICTION.IT MAY NOW BE QUESTIONED WHETHER THE BLACK COMMUNITY HAS ALREADY PASSED THEBASIC READING LEVEL, OR WHETHER RECREATIONAL READING FORMS PART OF THAT LEVEL.AS SOME 66|% OF THE BLACK MEMBERSHIP OF A LIBRARY MAY CONSIST OF CHILDREN, THEHIGH PERCENTAGE OF FICTION CIRCULATED RAISES DOUBTS ABOUT WHETHER THESECHILDREN SEE LIBRARIES PRIMARILY AS SOURCES OF INFORMATION, AND ABOUT THESUITABILITY OF NON-FICTION PROVIDED. ONLY ABOUT 5|% OF BLACKS USE AVAILABLELIBRARY FACILITIES. IT SHOULD BE INVESTIGATED WHETHER THE EDUCATIONAL APPROACHIS NOT BEING OVER-STRESSED IN BLACK PUBLIC LIBRARIES.
4589|ASPECTS CONCERNING THE PROGRESS IN THE USE OF THE SOURCES OF INFORMATION (INENGLISH AND RUMANIAN).     PRESENTS CONCLUSIONS FROM A STUDY OF USERS' INFORMATION HABITS CONCERNING THEDEGREE OF USE OF SOME TYPES OF INFORMATION SOURCE IN 3| STAGES' THEDISCIPLINE-ORIENTED; THE GOAL ORIENTED; AND THE PROBLEM-ORIENTED. THECHARACTERISTIC FEATURE OF THE STAGES IS THE PROCESS OF GRADUAL UNDERSTANDINGOF INFORMATION WHICH MODIFIES THE INFORMATION SEEKING PATTERNS OF THE USERS.SOME RECOMMENDATIONS ARE MADE CONCERNING THE APPROACH OF SECONDARY INFORMATIONSOURCES TO THE CONCRETE INFORMATION REQUIREMENTS OF USERS CONFRONTED WITHPRACTICAL PROBLEMS.
4590|USER FLUCTUATION AS THE TOTALITY OF USER MOVEMENT.     STATISTICS PRODUCED BY KOPENICK DISTRICT LIBRARY IN BERLIN BETWEEN 1969|-79|SHOW THAT EACH YEAR A CONSIDERABLE NUMBER OF NEW USERS ARE REGISTERED ALTHOUGHTHE TOTAL NUMBER OF READERS GROWS ONLY SLOWLY. THESE FIGURES REFLECT NATIONALTRENDS. THE USE OF THE TERM FLUCTUATION IN THIS CONTEXT IS DISCUSSED. USERSMAY LEAVE A LIBRARY FOR VARIOUS REASONS' UNAVOIDABLY, THROUGH ILLNESS ORDEATH; FROM SOCIAL NECESSITY, AS WHEN TRANSFERRING FROM THE CHILDREN'S TO THEADULT LIBRARY; FOR SOCIALLY ACCEPTABLE REASONS, E.G. MOVING HOUSE, MILITARYSERVICE; UNDESIRABLY, BECAUSE THEY FIND THE LIBRARY SERVICE UNSATISFACTORY.ANALYSIS OF ALL AVAILABLE STATISTICS SHOWS THAT 2|/3| OF THE KOPENICK RESIDENTSDO NOT USE THE LIBRARY AT ALL, WHICH AGAIN REFLECTS A NATIONAL TREND.
4591|USER STUDIES' A REVIEW OF IDEAS.     BRAZILIAN LIBRARY SCHOOL COURSE WORK PREPARED IN 1979|, BASED ON A REVIEW OFTHE LITERATURE. RECENT STUDIES HAVE TENDED TO ADOPT A SOCIOLOGICAL APPROACH'THE MOST COMMONLY USED SURVEY TECHNIQUES ARE OUTLINED, AND THEIR LIMITATIONSCRITICISED. SIGNIFICANT RESULTS OF STUDIES OF USERS OF SCIENTIFIC ANDTECHNICAL INFORMATION ARE SUMMARISED, TO ESTABLISH A BASIS FOR DISCUSSING HOWUSERS INTERACT WITH INFORMATION SYSTEMS. THE CHIEF FACTORS DETERMINING USERBEHAVIOUR ARE ISOLATED, AND THE NEED FOR FURTHER RESEARCH EMPHASISED.CONSIDERS THE SITUATION IN BRAZIL WITH SPECIFIC REFERENCE TO PUBLIC LIBRARIES,AN AREA HITHERTO VIRTUALLY UNRESEARCHED. THE IMPORTANCE OF KNOWING MORE ABOUTPOTENTIAL USERS HERE IS OF PRIMARY IMPORTANCE.
4592|THE MEETING OF READING RESEARCH SPECIALISTS.     REPORTS ON THE PROCEEDINGS OF THE 4|TH MEETING OF READING RESEARCH SPECIALISTSFROM EASTERN EUROPE, USSR AND CUBA THAT TOOK PLACE IN BERLIN 18|-21| NOV 80|.

OTHER PAPERS REPORTED ON THE STATE OF THE ART OF READING INPARTICULAR LOCATIONS, BOTH NATIONAL AND LOCAL.
4593|THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF WALTER HOFMANN AND RUDOLF ANGERMANN TOWARDS THEDEVELOPMENT OF USER RESEARCH METHODS, PART I.     HOFMANN AND ANGERMANN CARRIED OUT THEIR RESEARCH AT THE BEGINNING OF THISCENTURY, DURING THE PERIOD OF THE MOVEMENT FOR POPULAR EDUCATION. THEY FELTTHAT LIBRARY STAFF SHOULD KNOW ABOUT EACH READER'S REQUIREMENTS FROM ANDMOTIVATION TOWARDS READING SO THAT THE LIBRARY COULD PERFORM EFFECTIVELY ITSEDUCATIVE FUNCTION. HOFMANN ADVOCATED THE IMPORTANCE OF PERSONAL CONTACTBETWEEN STAFF AND READERS AND OF TYPOLOGICAL GROUPING OF READERS WITH THE AIDOF LOAN FREQUENCY STATISTICS. HIS NEW CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM FOR SUBJECTINDEXES WAS USED IN COMPILING CATALOGUES OF THE LEIPZIG BUCHERHALLE. HOFMANNALSO FAVOURED THE USE OF SELECTIVE INDEXES AIMED AT TARGET GROUPS IN ADDITIONTO THAT OF GENERAL CATALOGUES.
4594|THE USE OF PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN QUEBEC IN RELATION TO CERTAIN INBUILT VARIABLES.     REPORT OF A STUDY CARRIED OUT AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MONTREAL IN 1980|-81|, TOINVESTIGATE UNDER-USAGE, AND THE EFFECTS OF SUCH ELEMENTS IN THE INTERNALSYSTEM OF LIBRARY ORGANISATION AND OPERATION AS THE NUMBER OF DOCUMENTSAVAILABLE, STAFFING ARRANGEMENTS, AND HOURS OF OPENING. DATA WERE COLLECTEDFROM A SAMPLE OF THE TOTAL POPULATION OF POTENTIAL USERS BY INTERVIEW ANDQUESTIONNAIRE, AND ANALYSED MANUALLY. DETAILS ARE GIVEN OF CALCULATIONS TOESTABLISH THE RATE OF UNDER-USE, AND THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE EFFECT OF THEVARIABLES TESTED. FINDINGS SHOWED HOURS OF OPENING TO HAVE THE GREATESTINFLUENCE ON USE. CONCLUDES THAT ULTIMATELY THE LEVEL OF STAFFING IS CRUCIALIN PROMOTING LIBRARY USE, AND RECOMMENDS THAT GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS ONLIBRARY PERSONNEL TAKE THIS INTO ACCOUNT.

AMERICAN THESES FROM 1976|-77| TO 1980|-81| ON SECONDARYSCHOOL LIBRARIES HAVE FOCUSSED ON THE TOPICS OF MEDIA PROGRAMMES, PERSONNEL,AND USE, WHEREAS IN QUEBEC INTEREST HAS BEEN CONCENTRATED CHIEFLY ON USE. THERESULTS OF RESEARCH ON USE ARE SUMMARISED, AND THE SITUATION IN THE USA INGENERAL COMPARED WITH QUEBEC. QUEBEC SHOWS LITTLE CHANGE, AND IS FAR FROMMOVING TOWARDS THE AMERICAN CONCEPTION OF THE LIBRARY AS CENTRAL TO ALLTEACHING. FURTHER RESEARCH IS PROPOSED TO ESTABLISH THE REASONS FOR THISDEVELOPING CRISIS.
4596|THE CONTRIBUTION OF THE UNIVERSITY LIBRARY TOWARDS THE EDUCATION AND TRAININGOF STUDENTS.     THE RESULTS ARE PRESENTED OF A PILOT SURVEY CARRIED OUT AT THE HUMBOLDTUNIVERSITY IN BERLIN. THE 60| STUDENTS INTERVIEWED STRESSED THAT PERSONALCONTACT BETWEEN LECTURER AND STUDENT WAS THE MOST IMPORTANT AID TO EDUCATION,WHEN ADVICE ON READING AND WORK METHODS COULD BE GIVEN; THEY ALSO VALUEDREADING SUGGESTIONS FROM OTHER STUDENTS. AT LEAST 1|/2| THE STUDENTS INTERVIEWEDFOUND THE LIBRARY STAFF HELPFUL IN PROVIDING GUIDANCE ON LITERATURE STUDY. THELIBRARY WAS A GOOD PLACE FOR WORKING, ALTHOUGH DELAYS IN OBTAINING BOOKSSOMETIMES HELD UP THE STUDY PROGRAMME. SOME STUDENTS FELT THAT CONCENTRATIONON EXAMINATIONS IMPEDED THE GROWTH OF CREATIVE ABILITY. CLOSE CONTACT BETWEENLECTURERS AND LIBRARIANS IS ESSENTIAL FOR THE IMPROVEMENT OF STOCKS AND STUDYMETHODS.
4597|THE PRINCIPLE OF ECONOMIC EFFICIENCY IN ORGANISATION OF THE HIGHER EDUCATIONLIBRARIES AND IN THEIR SPECIALISED INFORMATION ACTIVITY (IN ENGLISH ANDRUMANIAN).     THE PROMPT SUPPLY OF SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION REQUIRED BY EDUCATION, RESEARCHAND PRODUCTION, AND REDUCTION OF RESEARCH TIME ARE THE ULTIMATE AIMS OF HIGHEREDUCATION LIBRARIES. PROPOSES THE REDUCTION OF 'DEAD TIME' IN SCIENTIFICRESEARCH BY' IMPROVEMENT OF THE READING CONDITIONS BY PROMPT SERVING OF THEREADER; KEEPING SPECIALISED STOCK IN SPECIALISED LIBRARIES; SHORTENING TIMEDEVOTED TO BIBLIOGRAPHY DEVELOPMENT. SUGGESTS THE MOST APPROPRIATE MEANS OFOBTAINING MAXIMUM EFFICIENCY IN MINIMUM TIME AND WITH MINIMUM EFFORT.
4598|WHAT ABOUT THE NON-USERS OF THE PUBLIC LIBRARY?.     THE CONTROVERSY CONCERNING THE RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF THE PUBLIC LIBRARY OFTHE USER 2|VERSUS1| THE NON-USER OF THE LIBRARY SERVICE IS CONSIDERED. THEIMPLICATION IS THAT THE LIBRARY CAN BE EFFECTIVE ONLY IF IT APPLIES ITSRESOURCES TOWARDS MEETING THE CULTURAL NEEDS OF THE WHOLE COMMUNITY. SOUTHAFRICA IN THE MAIN LACKS RESEARCH ON COMMUNITY NEEDS RELEVANT TO LIBRARYSERVICES. RESEARCH ON THE NON-USER IN THE UK, THE USA AND SOUTH AFRICA ISBRIEFLY REVIEWED. THE LIBRARY SHOULD MEET CULTURAL NEEDS FROM THE VIEWPOINT OFTHE USER AND NOT OF THE LIBRARIAN. THIS MAKES THE PUBLIC LIBRARY THE MOSTCOMPLEX OF ALL LIBRARY TYPES BECAUSE OF ITS DIVERSE USER TYPES. AN EXAMPLE ISGIVEN OF HOW THE CAPE TOWN CITY LIBRARIES CHANGED ITS POLICY IN SELECTINGCHILDREN'S BOOKS TO SATISFY ITS USERS' NEEDS MORE ADEQUATELY.
4599|THE PROPORTION OF READERS IN THE ELDERLY POPULATION OF QUEBEC AND OF CANADA.     PRESENTS STATISTICAL DATA COMPARING QUEBEC WITH CANADA AS A WHOLE, ON THEPROPORTION OF READERS IN THE ADULT POPULATION; AND ON THE PROPORTION OFREADERS OF VARIOUS TYPES OF MATERIAL IN THE ELDERLY (OVER 65|) POPULATION. THEPOSITION OF THE ELDERLY POPULATION IS THEN COMPARED WITH THAT OF THE TOTALADULT POPULATION, AND IN CONCLUSION DISCUSSES THE PROBABILITY THAT THE NUMBEROF ELDERLY READERS, AND PUBLIC LIBRARY USERS, WILL INCREASE, NECESSITATINGEXPANSION OF LIBRARY FACILITIES TO MEET THEIR DEMANDS.
4600|UTILIZATION OF SOME INFORMATION SOURCES BY STUDENTS IN TERMS OF THE PURPOSEFOR WHICH THE INFORMATION IS USED.     STUDY OF THE INFORMATION SOURCES USED BY STUDENTS, IN RELATION TO THEIRINFORMATION NEEDS. FOR COURSE MATERIAL THEY USE HANDBOOKS, TEXTS ANDSTANDARDS, BUT FOR STUDY OF NEW DEVELOPMENTS THEY USE JOURNAL ARTICLES. OTHERRESULTS ARE PRESENTED, AND CONCLUSIONS DRAWN FOR THE ORGANISATION OF LIBRARYAND INFORMATION CENTRES IN THE HIGHER EDUCATION FIELD.
4601|THE INDIVIDUAL AND COLLECTIVE READER.     THE RUSSIAN PEOPLE EVINCE A GROWING DEMAND FOR BOOKS. BUT WHERE WILL THE PAPERFOR MULTI-MILLION EDITIONS COME FROM? TRANSITION TO AN URBAN LIFE STYLE HASLED TO A GREATER DEMAND FOR BOOKS. MANY, WHO ARE NEW TO BOOK CULTURE, CONSIDERBOOKS AS PROUD POSSESSIONS, NOT FOR USE. THE DEMAND FOR BOOKS IS BEGINNING TORESEMBLE THAT FOR THE MASS MEDIA. BESTSELLERS EXACERBATE LIBRARIES' PROBLEMSITUATION. BESTSELLER TEXTS SHOULD IN FUTURE BE TRANSLATED TO ANOTHERINFORMATION CARRIER AND BE DISSEMINATED BY LIBRARIES OR THE TRADE. HOMES ANDLIBRARIES WILL STILL NEED THOSE BOOKS THAT ARE INTENDED FOR THE INDIVIDUALREADER.
4602|INVESTIGATION OF EFFICIENCY WITH FEEDBACK CARDS.     IN ORDER THAT AN INFORMATION SYSTEM SHOULD COMPLY WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OFRELEVANCE, PERTINENCE, CURRENCY AND OFFER COMPLETE INFORMATION, CONSTANTCONTROL AND ASSESSMENT REPORTS FROM USERS ARE NEEDED. THIS CAN BE ACHIEVED BYTHE ESTABLISHMENT OF FEEDBACK. NOWADAYS, IN THE FIELD OF MANUAL SERVICES THESIGNIFICANCE OF FEEDBACK IS GROWING. AFTER DESCRIBING SOME METHODS OF FEEDBACKAND FEEDBACK CARDS, INTRODUCES A SUBJECT FIELD OBSERVING SERVICE OFFERINGBIBLIOGRAPHIC DATA WHICH IS CARRIED OUT BY THE HUNGARIAN MEDICAL INFORMATIONINSTITUTE AND LIBRARY. DESCRIBES AN EXPERIMENT TO FIND OUT, WITH THE HELP OFFEEDBACK CARDS, THE SUBSCRIBERS' OPINION ON SERVICES.
4603|WHAT CAN THE PUBLIC LIBRARY DO TO INCREASE LITERACY?.     THE PUBLIC LIBRARY IS TRADITIONALLY REGARDED AS A RESOURCE FOR CULTURALLYADVANCED AND LITERATE PEOPLE. SOUTH AFRICA HAS BOTH DEVELOPED AND DEVELOPINGCOMMUNITIES. WHILE THE PUBLIC LIBRARY USUALLY FOCUSES ON THE NEEDS OFESTABLISHED READERS, THERE IS A SUBSTANTIAL CASE FOR PROVIDING INNOVATIVEFORMS OF SERVICE TO ILLITERATE AND NEO-LITERATE COMMUNITIES, AND FOR ACTUALLYPROMOTING LITERACY THROUGH THE LIBRARY. THE CONCEPT OF LITERACY IS DISCUSSEDIN TERMS OF THE DEVELOPED AND DEVELOPING SECTORS, AND LITERACY IS PLACED INITS CULTURAL CONTEXT. THE PROBLEMS OF SEMI-ILLITERACY AMONG EDUCATED PEOPLEARE SEEN AS PART OF THE SPECTRUM OF ILLITERACY, WHICH EXTENDS FROM FORMALLYEDUCATED PEOPLE WITH POOR READING ABILITY TO UNEDUCATED RURAL DWELLERS. THEROLE OF THE PUBLIC LIBRARY WITH REGARD TO LITERACY ACROSS THE SPECTRUM ISDISCUSSED, WITH SPECIFIC SUGGESTIONS GIVEN FOR TASKS WHICH THE PUBLIC LIBRARYCAN UNDERTAKE TO PROMOTE LITERACY.
4604|READING AND RECREATIONAL ACTIVITIES.     CRITICISES THE CONVENTIONAL APPROACH TO READING IN SCHOOLS, WHERE BOOKS AREUSED ESSENTIALLY FOR DIDACTIC PURPOSES. INSTEAD ARGUES THAT THE USE OF BOOKSSHOULD BE GEARED TO AROUSING INTEREST IN READING, AND PROPOSES THEINTRODUCTION OF TEXT-BASED GAMES, SERVING THE DUAL PURPOSE OF DEVELOPING THECAPACITY FOR REFLECTIVE THOUGHT AS WELL AS LEADING THE CHILD TO READ WITHENJOYMENT. EXAMPLES ARE GIVEN OF 3| TYPES OF GAMES FOR PARTICULAR AGE GROUPS,WITH FULL DETAILS OF OBJECTIVES, MATERIALS REQUIRED, AND PROCEDURE.
4605|PUBLIC LIBRARIES AND ADULT EDUCATION ('VOLKSHOCHSCHULEN') IN WEST GERMANY.     EXAMINES THE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH PUBLIC LIBRARIES AND ADULT EDUCATION INWEST GERMANY COOPERATE. DISCUSSES THE POLITICAL BACKGROUND' POLITICALPROGRAMMES CONCERNING THE CULTURAL DEVELOPMENT OF WEST GERMANY AS A WHOLE, ANDTHEIR INFLUENCE ON POLITICAL DECISIONS AT THE STATE LEVEL, GIVING NORTHRHINEWESTPHALIA AS AN EXAMPLE. ALSO COMPARES THE PROGRAMMES OF PUBLIC LIBRARIES ANDADULT EDUCATION AND REPRESENTATIVES OF BOTH ORGANISATIONS FORMULATE THOUGHTS,PLANS AND CONCEPTS REGARDING COOPERATION, WHICH REVEAL MUTUAL RELATIONS. 4|EXAMPLES ARE GIVEN TO SHOW HOW THIS COOPERATION WORKS IN REALITY.
4606|ADULT EDUCATION AND LIBRARIES.     A COLLECTION OF PAPERS PRESENTED AT 2| SEMINARS DEALING WITH THE ROLE OF INDIANPUBLIC LIBRARIES IN THE PROMOTION OF READING AND ADULT EDUCATION.

DESCRIBES COOPERATION IN SEPT 80| BETWEEN BROADSTAIRS, SITTINGBOURNE ANDFAVERSHAM PUBLIC LIBRARIES (KENT, UK) WITH LOCAL ADULT EDUCATION CENTRES ANDOTHER AGENCIES TO PROVIDE INFORMATION AND ADVICE TO THE PUBLIC. THE COMMON AIMWAS TO HELP INTENDING ADULT STUDENTS TO MAKE AN INFORMED CHOICE FROM THE WIDERANGE OF LOCAL OPPORTUNITIES AVAILABLE IN THE COMING AUTUMN PROGRAMME. ALSOBROADSTAIRS LIBRARY TRIED TO DEMONSTRATE WAYS IN WHICH IT CAN HELP STUDENTS TOMAKE THEIR COURSES MORE EFFECTIVE.
4608|PUBLIC LIBRARIES AND ADULT EDUCATION ASSOCIATIONS IN COOPERATION.     THE ADULT EDUCATION MOVEMENT BUILT UP LIBRARIES AT THE BEGINNING OF THE 20|THCENTURY, BUT WHEN THESE WERE TRANSFERRED TO THE MUNICIPAL LIBRARIES, THECONNECTION BETWEEN THE ORGANISATIONS AND LIBRARIES LARGELY CEASED. CONSCIOUSOF THIS, OREBRO REGIONAL LIBRARY IN CONJUNCTION WITH 4| PUBLIC LIBRARIES AND 4|ADULT EDUCATION ASSOCIATIONS DREW UP A PROJECT SUPPORTED BY THE CULTURALCOUNCIL FOR AN EXPERIMENTAL PERIOD OF 1| YEAR, WITH A PART-TIME LIBRARIAN ASORGANISER. THE AIM WAS TO ESTABLISH CONTACT WITH THE LEADERS, EXAMINE THEASSOCIATIONS' NEEDS AND HOW THE LIBRARY COULD MEET THEM. DIRECT CONTACT WITHTHE CLASS LEADERS PROVED DIFFICULT AND ADVANCE NOTICE OF BOOKS NEEDED HARD TOOBTAIN. STUDY VISITS TO THE LIBRARY WERE MADE BY SOME GROUPS, AND SPECIAL ANDBACKGROUND LITERATURE WAS LENT TO THE GROUPS ON LONG LOANS. CONCLUDES THAT THELIBRARIES OFTEN LACKED STAFF AND TIME TO TAKE THE NECESSARY INITIATIVES, ANDTHAT THE STUDY GROU P LEADER IS THE KEY TO ANY FRUITFUL CONTACT.
4609|REFERENCE SERVICES TO CHILDREN AND STUDENTS IN THE PUBLIC LIBRARY.     CONSIDERS THE SERVICE RENDERED BY THE BLOEMFONTEIN PUBLIC LIBRARY SOUTHAFRICA. THE REASONS WHY PUPILS IN THE 11|-16| YEARS AGE GROUP USED THE LIBRARYAS A SOURCE OF INFORMATION ARE GIVEN AS DETERMINED THROUGH A SURVEY. STUDENTSWERE NOT SIMILARLY SURVEYED BUT IMPRESSIONS OF THEIR LIBRARY USE ARE GIVEN.ATTENTION IS GIVEN TO THE CAPABILITIES REQUIRED OF LIBRARIANS SERVING THESE 2|GROUPS, AND TO METHODS OF DEVELOPING THESE CAPABILITIES. SOURCES OFINFORMATION MUST PROVIDE MANY LEVELS OF ENTRY TO INFORMATION TO CATER FORCHILDREN AT DIFFERENT LEVELS OF EDUCATION. BECAUSE OF SWIFT ADVANCEMENTS INTHE EDUCATION OF BLACK CHILDREN, SOUTH AFRICAN PUBLIC LIBRARIES CAN EXPECTGREAT STRAINS IN THE 1980|S IN PROVIDING THE REQUIRED REFERENCE SERVICES.
4610|THE PUBLIC LIBRARIAN AS ADULT LEARNERS' ADVISOR-AN INNOVATION IN HUMANSERVICES.     CONCERNS THE SERVICING OF THE ADULT LEARNER WHO IS PURSUING STUDY PROJECTS FORCREDIT OR FOR PERSONAL ENRICHMENT AND WHO USES THE LIBRARY AS A RESOURCECENTRE. FOCUSES ON THE ROLE OF THE LIBRARIAN AS A LEARNERS' ADVISOR, ONE WHOASSISTS THE PATRON IN MODES SPECIFIED BY THE NATURE OF THE LEARNING PROJECT,THE EXTENT OF THE COLLECTION AND SERVICES OFFERED BY THE LIBRARY, AND THEDEMANDS OF THE PROGRAMME THAT THE LIBRARY IS IMPLEMENTING.

HOWEVER, THE NEWSTRUCTURES REQUIRE A DEGREE OF CURRENT AND CONTINUOUS EXCHANGE OF INFORMATIONBETWEEN THE VARIOUS PARTS OF LIBRARY SYSTEMS. LOCAL LIBRARY JOURNALS CANCONTRIBUTE CONSIDERABLY TO COMMUNICATION ON THE PREMISES. THEY MAKE THELIBRARY SYSTEMS INTELLIGIBLE AND THEY SERVE CONTINUING EDUCATION ANDSTRENGTHEN THE CONTACTS BETWEEN LIBRARIES. AS THEY PROMOTE COOPERATION BY THEINTERLOCKING AND SUPPLY OF ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESSES, THEY PROVIDE FURTHERRATIONALE FOR COOPERATION IN LOCAL LIBRARY SYSTEMS.

67| MILLION FOR THE CONSTRUCTIONOF A NEW LIBRARY. THE BUILDING WHICH IS DUE FOR COMPLETION IN 1974| WILL HOUSETHE COMBINED PROVINCIAL AND CITY LIBRARIES TOGETHER WITH THE ZEELAND CENTRALMUSIC LIBRARY.

CONSIDERS THEIRACTUAL STATE AT PRESENT' HOUSED IN SUBSTANDARD BUILDINGS, UNDER-RESOURCED,STAFFED BY UNTRAINED PERSONNEL, AND USED MAINLY BY STUDENTS. THE IMPORTEDMODEL OF THE PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVING THE NEEDS OF ALL THE COMMUNITY ISINAPPROPRIATE TO THE SOCIAL REALITY IN BRAZIL, WHERE SOCIAL STRUCTURE IS BASEDON CLASS DIVISION. STATISTICS ARE PRESENTED TO SHOW THE EXTENT OF POTENTIALDEMAND, BUT DESPITE RECENT EXPANSION OF SERVICES, AND THE GROWTH OFPUBLISHING, THE POPULATION OF NON-USERS REMAINS CONSTANT, AND READINGCONTINUES TO BE AN ELITE LEISURE ACTIVITY.

4675|THE STRUGGLE FOR FULL IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PUBLIC LIBRARIES LAW-1975| (INHEBREW).     WHEN THE LAW WAS PASSED, IT WAS GENERALLY UNDERSTOOD THAT THE GOVERNMENT WOULDFINANCE 75|% OF PUBLIC LIBRARY BUDGETS. THE SITUATION OVER THE PAST SEVERALYEARS HAS BEEN THAT AN EVER-GROWING PERCENTAGE OF THE BUDGET IS COVERED BYLOCAL AUTHORITIES. THIS HAS NOT ONLY BROUGHT ABOUT A DETERIORATION OF PUBLICLIBRARY SERVICES, BUT MAY LEAD TO A SITUATION IN WHICH THE LIBRARIES SECTIONOF THE MINISTRY OF EDUCATION AND CULTURE WILL BE UNABLE TO ENFORCE THE HIGHSTANDARDS IT HAS SET, SINCE IT WILL NOT HAVE THE NECESSARY FUNDS TO PASS ON TOLOCAL AUTHORITIES. DOCUMENTS THE ACTIONS AND EFFORTS OF THE COMMITTEE ON THEFULL IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PUBLIC LIBRARIES LAW SINCE ITS FORMATION IN JUNE78|. THESE INCLUDE CORRESPONDENCE AND MEETINGS WITH SENIOR GOVERNMENT ANDPARLIAMENTARY OFFICIALS AND A PUBLIC EFFORT TO ACHIEVE IMPLEMENTATION, THEHEIGHT OF WHICH WAS A NATIONAL LIBRARIANS' DEMONSTRATION BEFORE THE MINISTRYOF E DUCATION AND CULTURE IN JERUSALEM IN JAN 80|.

COOPERATION BETWEEN LOCAL POLITICIANS AND LIBRARIANS ISOFTEN HAMPERED BY THE LIBRARIANS' PREFERENCE FOR CENTRALLY IMPOSED NORMSINSTEAD OF ADAPTATION TO LOCAL NEEDS. BUT IMPOSITION OF OBLIGATIONS TAKES AWAYSPONTANEITY. OBJECTS TO SELF-APPOINTED MORALISTS GUIDING THE PEOPLE'S CULTURALNEEDS IN A CERTAIN IDEOLOGICAL DIRECTION. COMPREHENSIVENESS, ONE OF THELIBRARY OBJECTIVES, CANNOT BE ON THE BASIS OF A PARTICULAR BOOK, WHICH MUSTNECESSARILY PRESENT A PARTICULAR VIEWPOINT, BUT MUST BE AN OVERALL GUIDELINE.THE LIBRARY LAW, LIKE MODERN EDUCATION AND SOCIAL LAWS, SHOULD SPECIFY ANOBLIGATION TO DEVELOPMENT PLANNING IN THE INDIVIDUAL AUTHORITY, NOT LAY DOWNEXTERNAL STRUCTURAL NORMS WITHOUT REGARD TO LOCAL CONDITIONS. THE LEADINGLIBRARIAN AND THE LEADING HEAD TEACHER MUST HAVE EQUAL  SAY ON THE CULTURALCOMMITTEE TO SECURE LIBRARIES' INDEPENDENCE FROM AN ADMINISTRATIVE LEADER FROMTHE EDUCATION SERVICE. LIBRARIES MUST NOURISH THE QUALIFIED DOUBT AND SUPPLYTHE MEANS FOR CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM OF EXPERT KNOWLEDGE NECESSARY IN THEDEMOCRATIC DECISION MAKING PROCESS. LIBRARIES AND LOCAL POLITICIANS MUSTCOOPERATE IN KEEPING ART AND CULTURE INDEPENDENT OF POLITICAL AND COMMERCIALINFLUENCE.

4685|MANAGEMENT-BY-OBJECTIVES APPLIED IN A SOUTH AFRICAN INDUSTRIAL LIBRARY.     MANAGEMENT-BY-OBJECTIVES IS SUGGESTED AS A MEANS TO JUSTIFY THE EXISTENCE OFAN INDUSTRIAL LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SERVICE. THE PREREQUISITES ARE THAT THEINDUSTRIAL LIBRARIAN MUST GRASP THE SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER WHICH ASERVICE FUNCTION OPERATES IN INDUSTRY AS WELL AS THE ATTITUDES TOWARDS THESEFUNCTIONS. HE MUST ALSO ACQUAINT HIMSELF WITH THE OBJECTIVES OF THEORGANISATION HE SERVES AND ARRANGE HIS SERVICES TO MAKE A DEFINABLECONTRIBUTION TOWARDS THE ACHIEVEMENT OF THESE ORGANISATIONAL OBJECTIVES. THEOBJECTIVES OF THE DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS MUST BE USED AS PREMISES FORDETERMINING WHERE THE LIBRARY AND INFORMATION FUNCTION SHOULD OPERATE AND HOWITS SERVICES SHOULD BE PRESENTED. THE INFORMATION SERVICE (WHICH CONSISTS OF 3|SECTIONS, A LIBRARY, TRANSLATION BUREAU AND INFORMATION DISSEMINATION) OF THESOUTH AFRICAN IRON AND STEEL INDUSTRIAL CORPORATION (ISCOR) IS USED AS AWORKING EXAMPLE. THE USE OF MBO BY ISC OR IS BRIEFLY DISCUSSED AND THEOBJECTIVES OF ISCOR AND ITS GENERAL MANAGER ARE MENTIONED.

4687|GERMAN LIBRARIES' THE FINANCIAL CRISIS AND ITS CONSEQUENCES.     LECTURE GIVEN TO A MEETING OF MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT IN BERLIN. GERMANS AREPROUD OF THEIR RIGHT TO THE FREE EXPRESSION OF OPINION IN SPEECH AND INWRITING, YET THIS VERY FREEDOM CAN CAUSE CONFUSION. SINCE INFORMATION CAN BEUNSCRUPULOUSLY MANIPULATED A RESPONSIBLE ATTITUDE MUST BE MAINTAINED.INTER-LIBRARY COOPERATION FOR STOCK PURCHASE AND LOANS IS ESSENTIAL TO KEEPCOSTS DOWN. LIBRARIES OFTEN RANK LOW IN LISTS OF CULTURAL PRIORITIES OWING TOA LACK OF INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR PROBLEMS AND A LACK OF PUBLIC INTEREST;MARKET ECONOMY CRITERIA CANNOT BE APPLIED TO THEM. THE PROVISION OFINFORMATION AND LITERATURE MUST BE PLANNED RATIONALLY. MANY LIBRARIES HAVE HADTO ACCEPT CUTS IN THEIR BUDGETS ALTHOUGH THE PRICES OF BOOKS AND PERIODICALSHAVE RISEN; COOPERATION BETWEEN LIBRARIES AND THE BOOK TRADE MUST BE IMPROVED.
4688|LIBRARY NEWS.COVE     RS SOME OF THE MAJOR ITEMS OF U.S. NATIONAL NEWS AFFECTING LIBRARY FUNDING ANDSUPPORT DURING 1980|.
4689|THE FINANCING OF THE PUBLIC LIBRARY.     THE DEVELOPMENT OF FINANCING METHODS FOR SOUTH AFRICAN PUBLIC LIBRARIES ISSKETCHED, FROM THE SUBSCRIPTION LIBRARY TO THE PARTNERSHIP SYSTEM IN WHICHCOSTS OF LOCAL LIBRARIES ARE SHARED BETWEEN THE PROVINCIAL LIBRARY SERVICESAND THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES. THE VARIOUS APPROACHES FOLLOWED IN THE 4| SOUTHAFRICAN PROVINCES ARE INDICATED. A GREAT NEED EXISTS FOR FURTHER RESEARCH ONTHE FINANCING OF PUBLIC LIBRARIES. PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN THE LARGE CITIESESPECIALLY ARE SUFFERING BECAUSE OF INADEQUATE FINANCING.

4691|ZZZZ.     DESCRIBES THE CAMPAIGN BY PUBLIC LIBRARIANS IN VIRGINIA TO INCREASE STATE AIDWITH THE HELP OF A LOBBYIST. THE GREATEST VICTORY WAS THE CREATION OF A JOINTSUBCOMMITTEE ON THE FUNDING OF LIBRARIES.
4692|THE PRINCIPLE OF THE 'FREE' PUBLIC LIBRARY.     FOR VARIOUS REASONS IT IS BECOMING MORE AND MORE DIFFICULT FOR PUBLICLIBRARIES TO OBTAIN SUFFICIENT FUNDS FROM THEIR AUTHORITIES, IN COMPETITIONWITH OTHER MORE ESSENTIAL SERVICES. FREE PUBLIC LIBRARIES ORIGINATED IN THE UKDURING THE MIDDLE OF THE LAST CENTURY, THEIR MAIN FUNCTION BEING THE UPLIFTINGOF THE UNEDUCATED. TODAY PUBLIC LIBRARIES MAINLY CONCENTRATE ON THE SUPPLYINGOF LIGHT READING MATTER, ESPECIALLY NOVELS, OF WHICH THE MAJORITY ARE, FROM ALITERARY POINT OF VIEW, OF A DUBIOUS NATURE. THE ARGUMENTS USED DURING THELAST CENTURY TO DEFEND THE PRINCIPLE OF FREE SERVICES ARE NO LONGER VALIDTODAY. THE FUNCTIONS OF THE MODERN PUBLIC LIBRARY ARE NEITHER FULLY PART OFTHE WORLD OF EDUCATION NOR THE WORLD OF RECREATION, WITH THE RESULT THAT ITSIMAGE TO THE OUTSIDE WORLD IS OBSCURE. CONSIDERS THAT, ALTHOUGH CONTINUEDFINANCING OF PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVICES BY THE SOUTH AFRICAN GOVERNMENT ISNECESSARY, NO VALID OBJECTION CAN BE FOUND TO CHARG E USERS FOR THOSE SERVICESWHICH ARE NOT ESSENTIAL FOR THE AIMS WHICH THE PUBLIC LIBRARY PURSUES.
4693|CAN LOCAL AUTHORITIES STILL AFFORD FREE PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVICES?.     THE VIEWS THAT VARIOUS MEMBERS OF A SOUTH AFRICAN COMMUNITY MAY HAVE ON THEPROVISION OF A FREE PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVICE BY THE LOCAL AUTHORITY AREEXPLORED.

4694|A COMPARISON BETWEEN MOBILE AND STATIONARY LIBRARIES IN RURAL AREAS WITHREFERENCE TO COSTS AND PERFORMANCE.     THERE IS STILL DISAGREEMENT OVER WHETHER MOBILE OR STATIONARY LIBRARIESPROVIDE THE BEST SERVICE FOR RURAL AREAS WITH POPULATIONS UNDER 5|,000|. MOBILELIBRARIES PERMIT FLEXIBLE ORGANISATION AND CAN COME CLOSE TO USERS' HOMES;THEY ARE OPERATED BY PROFESSIONAL STAFF WHO BRING A LARGE AND VARIED BOOKSTOCK SUPPLEMENTED BY CENTRAL RESERVES. SINCE THEY ARE ONLY IN 1| PLACE FOR ASHORT TIME, HOWEVER, THEY CANNOT EASILY BECOME CULTURAL CENTRES. SMALLSTATIONARY BRANCH LIBRARIES IN RURAL AREAS HAVE SMALL, RESTRICTED STOCKS ANDARE RARELY SERVED BY PROFESSIONAL STAFF. A COMPARISON OF INITIAL AND RUNNINGCOSTS FOR MOBILE AND SMALL STATIONARY BRANCH LIBRARIES IN MIDDLE FRANCONIAREVEALS THAT MOBILE LIBRARY PROVISION IS THE CHEAPER METHOD AND A COMPARISONOF PERFORMANCES, THAT IT IS THE MORE EFFICIENT.
4695|LIBRARY SERVICE IN GREAT BRITAIN' STANDING FAST.     EXAMINES THE EFFECT ON LIBRARIES IN THE UK OF THE ENFORCEMENT OF LOCALGOVERNMENT SPENDING CUTS. COMPARES THE SITUATION IN TOWER HAMLETS ANDLANCASHIRE, WHERE DRASTIC REDUCTIONS IN LIBRARY SPENDING HAVE TAKEN PLACE,WITH THAT IN CAMDEN, WHERE SPENDING HAS NOT BEEN CUT, BUT WHERE RATEPAYERS AREHAVING TO BEAR AN INCREASING LEVEL OF TAXATION FOR LIBRARIES AND OTHERSERVICES. DESCRIBES HOW PROBLEMS HAVE BEEN OVERCOME IN 2| AUTHORITIES' INSUTTON WHERE REVENUE-RAISING ACTIVITIES SUCH AS VIDEO GAMES HAVE BEENINTRODUCED; AND IN BRENT, WHERE THE COMMUNITY BASED LIBRARY SERVICE, BECAUSEOF ITS MAJOR COMMITMENT TO OUTREACH AND COMMUNITY BASED PROGRAMMES HAS BEENTREATED MORE FAVOURABLY THAN OTHER DEPARTMENTS. NOTES THE RESPONSE OF THEUNIONS AND THE LIBRARY ASSOCIATION TO THE SPENDING CUTS.
4696|THE CULTURAL POLICY OF LOCAL AUTHORITIES.     THE TEXT OF A TALK GIVEN TO A CONFERENCE ON LIBRARIES IN THE ICY WIND OFCULTURAL POLICY, HELD IN JARFALLA, MAY 81|. IN ORDER TO INFLUENCE CULTURALPOLICY THE CULTURAL PRODUCERS MUST INFORM THEMSELVES OF THE WHOLE SPHERE OFLOCAL POLITICS. LOCAL AUTHORITIES HAVE NO LEGAL OBLIGATION TO PROVIDE CULTURALACTIVITIES AND LEGISLATION LAYING DOWN MINIMUM STANDARDS FOR SUCH ACTIVITIES,AS IN FINLAND, SHOULD BE ENACTED.

FOR THIS PURPOSE COLLECTIONSOF MATERIAL RELATING TO MATTERS OF CURRENT, SOCIAL CONCERN SHOULD BE FORMED INLOCAL LIBRARIES. HOWEVER, MATERIAL OF THIS NATURE IS OFTEN DIFFICULT TO OBTAINAND TO ORGANISE. IN ADDITION, SINCE THE USEFUL LIFE OF SUCH MATERIAL IS OFTENSHORT, THE LIBRARIAN MUST ENSURE THROUGH CAREFUL PUBLICITY THAT THE COLLECTIONIS USED AS HEAVILY AS POSSIBLE. IN THE NETHERLANDS THE NEDERLANDS BIBLIOTHEEKEN LEKTUUR CENTRUM (DUTCH CENTRE FOR LIBRARIES AND LITERATURE) PLANS TOORGANISE A MEETING IN 1982| FOR LIBRARIANS TO DISCUSS THE ORGANISATION ANDEXPLOITATION OF SUCH COLLECTIONS IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES.
4746|THE LIBRARY AS A MUNICIPAL INFORMATION CENTRE' A DANISH EXAMPLE.     WITH THE EVER-INCREASING AMOUNT OF GOVERNMENT LEGISLATION AT NATIONAL ANDLOCAL LEVEL IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT ALL CITIZENS HAVE ACCESS TO INFORMATION ABOUTTHEIR RIGHTS AND DUTIES. AT LYNGBY-TAARBAEK IN DENMARK A DEPARTMENT OFCOMMUNITY INFORMATION WAS CREATED IN 1977| TO PROVIDE SUCH A SERVICE. THECOLLECTION INCLUDES MATERIAL ON ENVIRONMENTAL PLANNING, MINUTES OF LOCALCOUNCIL MEETINGS, AND THE ADDRESSES AND SERVICES OF LOCAL ORGANISATIONS.EXHIBITIONS ARE HELD ON TOPICS OF CURRENT INTEREST AND A LARGE PART OF THECOLLECTION IS AVAILABLE FOR LOAN. AT THE START OF THE SERVICE A PUBLICITYCAMPAIGN WAS HELD WITH ADVERTISING POSTERS AND NOTICES IN LOCAL NEWSPAPERS,AND THE DEPARTMENT NOW ANSWERS SOME 300|-400| ENQUIRIES PER MONTH.

4750|INFORMATION SERVICES TO TRADE, INDUSTRY AND THE PROFESSIONS.     THE LARGE PUBLIC LIBRARY, SUCH AS THE JOHANNESBURG PUBLIC LIBRARY, SOUTHAFRICA, THAT IS SITUATED IN AN AREA WITH MANY SPECIAL LIBRARIES, CAN PROVIDEAN INFORMATION SERVICE TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC WHO ARE WITHOUT ACCESS TO THESPECIAL LIBRARIES. SUCH A LIBRARY CAN OFTEN PROVIDE REFERENCE MATERIAL WHICHIS NOT SPECIALISED ENOUGH FOR THE SPECIAL LIBRARY WHILE NOT POPULAR ENOUGH FORTHE SMALLER PUBLIC LIBRARY. AT LEAST SOME INFORMATION SOURCES ON A VERY WIDERANGE OF SUBJECTS ARE REQUIRED. THE LIBRARY STAFF CANNOT BE EXPERTS ON ALLTHESE FIELDS. THEY CONSEQUENTLY REFER USERS TO INFORMATION SOURCES AND EXPECTUSERS TO DO THEIR OWN SEARCHING. USERS OFTEN FALL IN THE SMALL BUSINESSCATEGORY AND ARE WITHOUT LIBRARIES OF THEIR OWN. THE INFORMATION THEY NEED MAYSOMETIMES NOT BE AVAILABLE IN A FORM APPLICABLE TO THE SOUTH AFRICANSITUATION. THE JOHANNESBURG PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVES AS A DEPOSITORY FOR THEJOURNALS RECEIVED BY MANY SCIENTIFIC A ND TECHNICAL SOCIETIES IN JOHANNESBURG,AND IN SOME CASES THE LIBRARY MANAGES AND MAINTAINS THE LIBRARY OF A SOCIETYWITHIN THE JPL BUILDING. RENDERING INFORMATION SERVICES IS ONE WAY TO SHOWTHAT THE LIBRARY IS USING PUBLIC MONEY TO GOOD ADVANTAGE.

THE INFORMATION EXTRACTED FROM THESESOURCES IS CLASSIFIED INTO 75| SUBJECT FIELDS COVERING THE SOCIAL, CULTURAL ANDPOLITICAL LIFE OF THE PROVINCE, AND AT PRESENT 57| LIBRARIES SUBSCRIBE TO THISSERVICE. IN THE NAARDEN-BUSSUM CENTRAL PUBLIC LIBRARY IN THE NETHERLANDS ASIMILAR SERVICE WAS FORMED IN OCT 79| RELATING TO EMPLOYMENT AND TRAININGOPPORTUNITIES. DUE TO LACK OF FUNDS THE SERVICE IS ORGANISED BY AN UNPAID,VOLUNTARY ASSISTANT.
4803|EVALUATION METHODOLOGY FOR DATA BASES IN AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES.     REPORT OF A STUDY COMPARING AGRICOLA, AGRIS AND CAB, INTENDED PRIMARILY TOESTABLISH SELECTION CRITERIA FOR USE AND ACQUISITION. REFERENCES WERERETRIEVED RELATING TO 11| DIFFERENT PRODUCTS, BY EACH OF THE 3| DATA BASESSINGLY, AND IN COMBINATIONS OF 2|, AND COMPARED FOR DUPLICATION AND DIVERSITY.DETAILS ARE GIVEN OF INITIAL HYPOTHESES, AND MATERIALS AND METHODS USED.RESULTS ARE PRESENTED IN FULL, AND AN INDEX OF DUPLICATION CALCULATED, SHOWINGWHICH COMBINATION OF 2| OUT OF 3| DATA BASES IS THE MOST EFFICIENT. THE DATAOBTAINED WERE ALSO USED TO INVESTIGATE PUBLICATION LANGUAGES AND COUNTIES OFORIGIN OF ARTICLES. REFINEMENTS OF THE METHODOLOGY USED ARE SUGGESTED.
4804|SDI IN AN ACADEMIC COMMUNITY.     A 6|-MONTH EXPERIMENTAL SDI SERVICE WAS UNDERTAKEN AT THE UNIVERSITY OF NATALLIBRARY, PIETERMARITZBURG SOUTH AFRICA, AS PART OF A PLAN TO MAKE SUBJECTLIBRARIANS MORE SERVICE ORIENTATED, AND IN THE KNOWLEDGE THAT RESEARCH TIMEFOR ACADEMICS WAS AT A PREMIUM. A METHODOLOGY WAS DEVISED AND 21| LECTURERSFROM ACROSS THE ACADEMIC SPECTRUM SUBMITTED 27| PROFILES. REFERENCES WERESUPPLIED FROM JOURNALS AND MONOGRAPHS AND FROM ABSTRACTING TOOLS WHERE THELIBRARY HAD POOR LITERATURE COVERAGE. AT THE END OF THE 6| MONTHS, FEEDBACKREVEALED THAT 93|% OF THE REFERENCES ASSESSED (82|%) WERE RELEVANT OR APPARENTLYRELEVANT, SHOWING THAT BIBLIOGRAPHIC RATHER THAN TERMINOLOGICAL SKILLS WERETHE SALIENT FACTOR. ACADEMIC RESPONSE WAS UNANIMOUSLY IN FAVOUR OF ACONTINUATION OF THE SERVICE, WHILE A FEW RESPONDENTS WANTED MINORIMPROVEMENTS. THE SUBJECT LIBRARIANS FOUND THAT THE SERVICE INCREASED JOBSATISFACTION AND ALLOWED THEM TO LOOK MORE CRITICALLY AT LIBRARY STOCK. INTERMS OF  TIME AND FINANCIAL COST THE SDI SERVICE WAS EASILY ABSORBED INTO THEEXISTING WORK STRUCTURE OF THE LIBRARY. IT WAS FOUND TO BE PARTICULARLYRELEVANT TO INTERDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH, AND IT RELIED UPON A WELL-DEVELOPEDSUBJECT LIBRARIAN STRUCTURE. ITS SUCCESS, HOWEVER, DEPENDED ON AN ACTIVECAMPAIGN BY LIBRARIANS DIRECTED AT POTENTIAL PARTICIPANTS.

4810|INDEXES TO HEBREW PERIODICALS-A BIBLIOGRAPHY (IN HEBREW).     THERE IS A GROWING DEMAND ON THE PART OF HIGH-SCHOOL AND UNIVERSITY STUDENTS,AS WELL AS THE GENERAL READING PUBLIC, FOR INFORMATION INCLUDED IN HEBREWPERIODICALS. IT IS SURPRISING, THEREFORE, HOW FEW EDITORS HAVE SUPPLIED THEIRREADERS WITH CUMULATIVE INDEXES. NOTES 8| ITEMS-CURRENT AND RETROSPECTIVE-WHICHINDEX MORE THAN 1| HEBREW PERIODICAL.

4813|REFERENCE SERVICE, REFERENCE LIBRARIAN AND SOURCES OF INFORMATION.     REFERENCE SERVICE IS DEFINED AS A DIRECT INTERACTION BETWEEN THE USER AND THESTAFF. REFERENCE LIBRARIANS PLAY A VITAL ROLE IN COMMUNICATION OF INFORMATION.THE MAJOR SOURCE OF INFORMATION IS THE ENORMOUS OUTPUT OF LITERATURE. THEREFERENCE LIBRARIAN NEEDS A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF THESE SOURCES TO PROVIDETHE RIGHT INFORMATION TO THE RIGHT READER AT THE RIGHT TIME.

THROUGH THE USE OFACTIVE LISTENING, MORE PRECISE COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE PATRON AND REFERENCELIBRARIAN CAN BE ESTABLISHED AND BETTER REFERENCE SERVICE GIVEN.
4816|JOB MOTIVATION AND SATISFACTION OF REFERENCE STAFF IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES.     ARGUES THAT DESPITE AUTOMATION, LIBRARY WORK WILL REMAIN LABOUR INTENSIVE; ITIS THEREFORE ESSENTIAL TO CONSIDER THE HUMAN ASPECT OF THE SITUATION,PARTICULARLY IN REFERENCE WORK, WHERE IN GENERAL THE QUALITY IS LOW. TOINVESTIGATE THE RELATION BETWEEN JOB MOTIVATION AND SATISFACTION, A SURVEY WASCARRIED OUT AMONG ONTARIO REFERENCE LIBRARY STAFF, USING TECHNIQUES OFANALYSIS AND MEASUREMENT ADAPTED FROM THE FIELD OF BUSINESS STUDIES. DETAILSARE GIVEN OF THE METHODOLOGY, QUESTIONNAIRE CONSTRUCTION, AND RATINGTECHNIQUES. RESULTS SHOWED GENERALLY MODERATE SATISFACTION WITH ENVIRONMENTALCONDITIONS, BUT LOW MOTIVATION. THE INITIAL HYPOTHESIS, THAT PROFESSIONALSWOULD EXPRESS GREATER MOTIVATION AND SATISFACTION THAN NON-PROFESSIONALS, WASNOT CONFIRMED.

LIBRARIANS SHOULD HELP READERS TO APPRECIATEPUSHKIN'S POETRY. THE REGIONAL LIBRARY COULD COMPILE A WORK ON PUSHKIN BASEDON THE MUSEUM'S VISITORS' BOOKS, DATING FROM 1899|. READERS COULD BE ENCOURAGEDTO DESCRIBE HOW THEY DISCOVERED PUSHKIN. PUSHKIN LITERARY EVENINGS SHOULDTREAT ONLY ONE OF HIS WORKS AND ADAPT TO THE AUDIENCE'S AGE GROUP. FOR THESE,LIBRARIANS COULD STUDY VARIANTS OF HIS POEMS, THE SOCIAL LIFE AND POPULARCULTURE OF HIS TIME. THE PUSHKINOGORETS REGIONAL LIBRARY SHOULD BECOME AREPOSITORY OF PUSHKIN AREA LEGENDS. THE MUSEUM STRIVES TO ENCOURAGE A LIVELYPERCEPTION OF HISTORY.
4819|POETRY, COFFEE AND CAKES: POETRY CAFE OSTERGARD.     DESCRIBES THE EFFORTS OF HALMSTAD PUBLIC LIBRARY TO PROMOTE POETRY. SWEDISHPUBLIC LIBRARIES ACQUIRE VERY LITTLE POETRY, AND POETRY EVENINGS ARE ANEXCEPTION. POETRY CAFE OSTERGARD BEGAN IN AUTUMN 80| WITH EVENING GATHERINGSHELD IN HALMSTAD'S BRANCH LIBRARY IN OSTERGARD SCHOOL. THE AIM WAS NOT TOREPLACE HALMSTAD CENTRAL LIBRARY'S AUTHOR EVENINGS, BUT TO COMPLEMENT THEMWITH ACTIVITIES IN A BRANCH LIBRARY. NEW FORMS WERE SOUGHT WHICH INVOLVED THEPARTICIPANTS IN ACTIVE LISTENING AND CONVERSATION. A CAFE ATMOSPHERE WITHCOFFEE AND CAKES WAS CREATED. MANY OF THE POETS LIVED LOCALLY. THE LIBRARYPRINTS POSTERS AND ADVERTISES IN THE LOCAL PRESS AND RADIO PRIOR TO EACHEVENING AND PREPARES FREE FOLDERS WITH POEMS AND INTRODUCTIONS TO THE POETS.EMPHASISES THAT THERE MUST BE CONTINUITY THROUGH REGULAR ACTIVITIES AND THATMORE PERSONAL CONTACT TO PROMOTE THE EVENINGS AND MORE PARTICIPATION BYAMATEUR POETS ARE NEEDED IF THE CAFE IS TO CONT INUE.

4822|THE LITERATURE SEARCH THAT WENT UP IN SMOKE.     SINCE 1977|, THE LIBRARIANS' UNION HAS STRESSED THAT AUTOMATION IN LIBRARIESSHOULD BEGIN WITH BIBLIOGRAPHIC SYSTEMS. BIBLIOTEKSDATA HAS REPLIED THAT THEIRDEVELOPMENT PLANS AGREE WITH THIS PRIORITY, BUT ADDS THAT LOCAL LIBRARIES MUSTBE FREE TO DECIDE WHICH AUTOMATION SYSTEM TO USE. FEARS THAT BIBLIOTEKSDATA,IN EFFECT, IS GIVING PRIORITY TO AUTOMATION OF ADMINISTRATIVE TASKS, SUCH ASISSUES AND ACQUISITIONS, ALTHOUGH THE UNION HAS ARGUED THE NEED FOR TERMINALACCESS FOR LIBRARIES TO THE BIBLIOGRAPHIC DATA BASE. PROVISION OF SUCH ACCESSHAS BEEN HELD UP BY THE FACT THAT THE QUESTION OF THE BEST SUBJECT SEARCHSYSTEM HAS NOT YET BEEN SOLVED. MEANTIME, HOWEVER, ATTEMPTS SHOULD BE MADE TOPROVIDE TERMINAL ACCESS WITH FREE TEXT SEARCHING, SIMILAR SEARCHING ONMICROFORM, AND EXPANSION OF BIBLIOGRAPHIC ENTRIES WITH SUBJECT WORDS. ARGUESTHAT THE LIMITED RESOURCES SHOULD BE CONCENTRATED ON THE MOST IMPORTANT AREA'SERVICES.
4823|BIBLIOTHEKSDATA HAS A PLAN.     A STATEMENTS BY BIBLIOTEKSDATA ON ITS PAST ACHIEVEMENT AND FUTURE PLANS. SINCE1974|, THE LIBRARY CENTRE HAS BEEN BUILDING UP A DATA BASE OF NOW 280|,000|TITLES, INVALUABLE FOR LIBRARIES IN THEIR STOCK REGISTRATION. THE EXPERIENCEFROM THE AUTOMATION OF OLSTYKKE LIBRARY WILL ALSO BENEFIT THE FUTURE SYSTEM.SPECIFICATIONS FOR REGISTRATION OF MATERIALS, ISSUE CONTROL AND CATALOGUESHAVE BEEN DEVELOPED. A PROJECT CONSISTING OF MODULES WHICH LIBRARIES CANACCEPT GRADUALLY HAS NOW BEEN DEVELOPED. THE PROJECT IS DEPENDENT ON' COMPUTERREGISTRATION OF LIBRARIES' STOCK, DECENTRALISED INPUT OF DATA IN OWNTERMINALS, STANDARDISATION, GRADUAL INTRODUCTION OF MODULES AS THEY BECOMEREADY, AND LOCALLY DETERMINED SELECTION OF MODULES. THE CATALOGUING MODULEWILL BE READY AT THE END OF 1982|, THE ISSUE AND ACQUISITIONS MODULES DURING1983|. THE BETA MODULE MAKES IT POSSIBLE TO REGISTER A LIBRARY'S HOLDINGS OFTITLES ALREADY IN THE LIBRARY CENTRE BASE. SUPPLIERS OF HARDWARE ARE TO  BECHOSEN DURING SPRING 82|; RUNNING COSTS CAN, THEREFORE, NOT BE CALCULATED YET.
4824|AUTOMATION IN AUSTRIAN LIBRARIES.     PAPER PRESENTED AT THE 1|ST AUSTRIAN-SOVIET SEMINAR ON THE ROLE OF LIBRARIES INA COUNTRY'S SOCIO-ECONOMIC AND CULTURAL LIFE, HELD AT THE LENIN STATE LIBRARY,20|-22| MAR 79|. DESCRIBES AN AUTOMATED LIBRARY SYSTEM ADOPTED BY THE GRAZUNIVERSITY LIBRARY, SELECTED TO CARRY OUT AN AUTOMATION PROJECT BEFORE THEINTRODUCTION OF COMPUTERISATION IN OTHER AUSTRIAN RESEARCH LIBRARIESADMINISTERED BY THE FEDERAL MINISTRY OF SCIENCE AND RESEARCH. THE SYSTEMCOMPRISES A COMPUTERISED ISSUE SYSTEM BASED ON THE LIGHT PEN AND ON-LINECATALOGUING AND SEARCHING. WHEN THE SYSTEM BECOMES FULLY OPERATIONALTHROUGHOUT ALL LIBRARIES CONCERNED, THE NETWORK WILL BE DIVIDED BY REGIONSINTO SMALLER UNITS AND EACH LIBRARY WILL HAVE ITS MINICOMPUTER. USER SERVICESWILL BE IMPROVED BY THE POSSIBILITY OF INFORMATION RETRIEVAL THROUGH THE LARGEINTERNATIONAL DATA BASES.
4825|COLLECTION PROCESSING AS A TEAM EFFORT.     DESCRIBES THE EXPERIMENT, CARRIED OUT AT THE ARCHIVES OF APPALACHIA, TOCOMPARE THE TEAM APPROACH TO COLLECTION PROCESSING WITH THE MORE TRADITIONALONE. STUDENT-WORKERS WERE EMPLOYED ON REPETITIVE PROCESSING TASKS, INCLUDINGCLEANING/FLATTENING AND TREATMENT FOR MOULDS AND INSECT INFESTATION ANDRESULTS SHOWED THAT THE EXPERIMENTAL COLLECTIONS WERE PROCESSED EXPEDITIOUSLYWITHOUT ANY SACRIFICE IN THE QUALITY OF EITHER ARRANGEMENT OR DESCRIPTION ANDTOTAL MONTHLY OUTPUT FROM THE TEAM WAS 3| TIMES THAT FROM A SINGLE ARCHIVISTWORKING ALONE.
4826|PROPOSAL FOR A COMMON EXCHANGE/COMMUNICATION FORMAT' OPINION PAPER ONSTANDARDIZATION OF MACHINE READABLE BIBLIOGRAPHIC RECORDS.     THE INTERNATIONAL ORGANISATION FOR STANDARDIZATION DEVELOPED ITS STANDARD ISO'2709|-1973| WHICH FORMED THE BASIS FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF SEVERAL MACHINEREADABLE BIBLIOGRAPHIC RECORD FORMATS. OUTLINES A FORMAT GIVING MUCHIMPORTANCE TO THE DATA ELEMENTS AND THEIR CONSTITUENTS, WITH UNIQUEIDENTIFICATION FOR EACH OF THE CONSTITUENTS FOLLOWING A TAGGING SCHEME. AMODEL FORMAT FOR THE BIBLIOGRAPHIC DESCRIPTION OF SIMPLE MONOGRAPHS ISPRESENTED AS ILLUSTRATION WHICH REFLECTS A SINGLY LINKED LIST STRUCTURE, EACHPRECEDING TAG OF A DATA ELEMENT HAVING A FIELD GIVING THE LENGTH OF THEASSOCIATED DATA ELEMENT, WHICH SERVES AS A POINTER TO THE BEGINNING OF THESUCCEEDING TAG AND ITS ASSOCIATED DATA ELEMENT.
4827|UNIMARC.     SEVERAL AGENCIES THAT WERE FORMERLY SATISFIED BY SINGLE CONVERSIONS FROMANOTHER FORMAT ARE BEGINNING TO REQUIRE DATA FROM MULTIPLE AGENCIES. EITHERMULTIPLE CONVERSIONS MUST BE WRITTEN OR A SWITCH TO UNIMARC COULD TAKE PLACE.THE COST SAVINGS WITH UNIMARC ARE OBVIOUS. MULTIPLE CONVERSIONS PROGRAMMESREPRESENT A HIGH INITIAL INVESTMENT AND A TREMENDOUS PROBLEM IN KEEPING UPWITH ALL OF THE CHANGES TO NECESSARILY DYNAMIC NATIONAL FORMATS. THEINTRODUCTION OF AACR2| AND RESULTANT NATIONAL FORMAT CHANGES ARE AT THIS TIMECAUSING SEVERAL AGENCIES TO REWRITE CONVERSION PROGRAMMES. A MAJOR OBSTACLE TOA TRULY INTERNATIONAL UNIMARC EXCHANGE IS THAT THE CHANGE TAKES A JOINTCOMMITMENT SINCE AN AGENCY'S ABILITY TO RECEIVE UNIMARC RECORDS IS USELESS IFTHE SENDING AGENCY CANNOT SEND THEM. IFLA AND ITS MEMBERS NEED TO UNDERTAKE AMAJOR EFFORT TO BRING A UNIMARC PROGRAMME INTO SERVICE.
4828|THE PHILSOM AUTOMATED SERIALS CONTROL SYSTEM' AN INTRODUCTION.     DESCRIBES THE PHILSOM AUTOMATED SERIALS CONTROL SYSTEM DEVELOPED AT THEWASHINGTON UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE LIBRARY AT ST. LOUIS, WHICH PROVIDESAUTOMATED SUPPORT FOR THE FULL RANGE OF SERIALS CONTROL ACTIVITY WITHIN THELIBRARIES PARTICIPATING IN THE PHILSOM NETWORK. THE PHILSOM SYSTEM ATTEMPTS TOPREDICT THE ISSUES WHICH WILL BE RECEIVED BY THE VARIOUS PARTICIPATINGLIBRARIES AND TO PROVIDE THEM WITH RECORDS DESCRIBING EACH OF THESE ISSUES.THE RECORDS FOR CHECKED-IN ISSUES AUTOMATICALLY UPDATE THE HOLDINGS DATA, ANDINTERACT WITH PREVIOUSLY CODED DATA TO PRODUCE CLAIMS AND BINDINGNOTIFICATIONS. THE SYSTEM ALSO PRODUCES ADDITIONAL OUTPUTS TO AID IN SERIALSCONTROL.
4829|FOREIGN LITERATURE ACQUISITIONS IN THE SWEDISH NATIONAL LIBRARY.     PAPER PRESENTED AT THE 1|ST SWEDISH-SOVIET SEMINAR ON 'THE NATIONAL LIBRARYWITHIN A COUNTRY'S LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SERVICES' DEVELOPMENT PROSPECTS'HELD IN MOSCOW, 21|-22| NOV 78|. FOREIGN LITERATURE ACQUISITIONS IN THE ROYALLIBRARY REFLECT THE LIBRARY'S 2| MAIN FUNCTIONS, THAT OF THE SWEDISH NATIONALLIBRARY AND STOCKHOLM'S CENTRAL LIBRARY IN THE FIELDS OF HUMANITIES AND SOCIALSCIENCES. MATERIAL ACQUIRED IN KEEPING WITH THE 1|ST FUNCTION (SUECANAEXTRANEA) IS DIVIDED INTO 4| SECTIONS-FOREIGN TRANSLATIONS OF SWEDISH WRITERS'WORKS, WORKS IN SWEDISH PUBLISHED ABROAD, WORKS ON SWEDEN AND WORKS OF SWEDISHNATIONALS PUBLISHED ABROAD. EXCHANGES OF PUBLICATIONS WITH LIBRARIES IN OTHERCOUNTRIES ARE AN IMPORTANT FACTOR IN ACQUISITIONS ESPECIALLY WITH REGARD TOTHE LIBRARY'S 2|ND FUNCTION.
4830|HOW TO ACHIEVE A RATIONAL STATEMENT, OR THAT IS ON THE NEED TO CHANGE THEACQUISITION AND CONTROL OF BOOK COLLECTIONS.     CONSIDERS IN DETAIL THE PRESENT SITUATION IN POLAND BY WHICH NEW PUBLICATIONSARE ORDERED AND DISTRIBUTED FROM A CENTRALISED STOCK CONTROL. THE SYSTEM WHICHHAS MANY FAULTS IS CRITICISED AND SOME SUGGESTIONS ARE MADE FOR ITSALTERATION.
4831|CENTRALISED DISTRICT SYSTEM OF ACQUISITION.     IN SLOVAK PUBLIC LIBRARIES 3| MODES OF ACQUISITIONS ARE PRACTISED AT PRESENT'THE INDIVIDUAL ONE, IN WHICH EVERY LIBRARY TRIES TO SATISFY ITS USERS' NEEDSFROM ITS OWN STOCK; COMBINED MODE IN WHICH THE DISTRICT LIBRARY PROVIDES SOMELIBRARIES IN THE DISTRICT WITH LITERATURE; TOTAL CENTRALISATION OFACQUISITION, PRACTISED BY 17| DISTRICT LIBRARIES. THE LATTER IS THE MOSTRATIONAL MEANS OF ACQUISITION ON CONDITION THAT THE LITERATURE IS PROCESSED IN1| CENTRE AND THAT A COLLECTIVE CATALOGUE IS KEPT. EACH CENTRAL LIBRARY MUSTFORMULATE ITS ACQUISITION POLICY TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THE REQUIREMENTS OFREADERS/USERS OF THE INDIVIDUAL LIBRARIES.
4832|THE GUIDELINE ON STOCK EXPANSION IN GENERAL PUBLIC LIBRARIES.     IN THE 1976|-80| GUIDELINES ON LIBRARIES IN EAST GERMANY, LONG-TERM STOCKPLANNING WAS ADVOCATED ON A BASIS OF DIFFERENTIAL VALUES FOR STOCK ITEMS PERINHABITANT, SO THAT STOCKS CAN BE ACQUIRED WHICH ALLOW FOR SOCIAL DEMANDS.FUNCTIONAL EQUIPPING OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF LIBRARY IS NECESSARY TO FACILITATEREGIONAL PURCHASING SCHEME DEVELOPMENT. THE STOCK GUIDELINE FOR 1981|-85|EMPHASISES STOCK EXPANSION AND THE PURCHASE OF REPLACEMENT COPIES; OTHERGUIDELINES COVER THE EXPANSION OF AUDIO-VISUAL MEDIA SERVICES, NEW RULES ONTHE PURCHASE OF PERIODICALS AND NEWSPAPERS AND EXTRA PROVISION OF BOOKS INHOLIDAY RESORTS. THE LATEST GUIDELINES SHOULD REMOVE UNJUSTIFIABLE DIFFERENCESIN STOCK STANDARDS.
4833|SELECTED ASPECTS FROM THE CHANGE OF GUIDELINES ON STOCK EXPANSION IN LIBRARIESIN THE LEIPZIG AREA.     IN 1975| THE NUMBER OF STOCK ITEMS PER INHABITANT IN LEIPZIG LIBRARIES WASSLIGHTLY BELOW THE NATIONAL AVERAGE, SO PLANS FOR 1976|-80| EMPHASISED STOCKEXPANSION. VARIABLE PROVISION STANDARDS WERE CALCULATED FOR CENTRAL AND BRANCHLIBRARIES. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS OF RESULTS FOR THIS PERIOD SHOWS A LARGE STOCKBUDGET, SO THAT IN SEVERAL AREAS THE REQUIRED LEVELS OF STOCK PROVISION WEREREACHED OR EVEN EXCEEDED. ONLY SOME OF THE MOST DENSELY POPULATED AREAS FELLBELOW THE REQUISITE STANDARDS. OTHER AIMS FOR 1976|-80| WERE THE EXPANSION ANDQUALITATIVE IMPROVEMENT OF STOCKS IN THE CENTRAL LIBRARY AND THE RAISING OFPERIODICAL SUBSCRIPTION CHARGES. PARTICULAR DIFFICULTY WAS EXPERIENCED WITHSTOCKS FOR RURAL LIBRARIES, ESPECIALLY FOR PART-TIME BRANCH LIBRARIES;GUIDELINES FOR 1981|-85| AIM TO IMPROVE THIS ASPECT OF THE SERVICE.
4834|RUSHMORE AT BERKELEY' THE DYNAMICS OF DEVELOPING A WRITTEN COLLECTIONDEVELOPMENT POLICY STATEMENT.     FOR THE 1|ST TIME IN ITS 100| YEAR HISTORY, THE GENERAL LIBRARY OF THEUNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT BERKELEY HAS PRODUCED A WRITTEN, COORDINATEDCOLLECTION DEVELOPMENT POLICY STATEMENT. PROVIDES AN ACCOUNT OF THE DYNAMICSOF THE PROCESS OF COLLECTION DEVELOPMENT DESIGN AND THE COOPERATIVE EFFORTS OF65| BOOK SELECTORS IN RECORDING POLICY DECISIONS AGREED UPON FOR THE COLLECTINGLEVELS IN ALL AREAS OF HUMAN KNOWLEDGE APPROPRIATE TO SUPPORT THE COMPLEXRESEARCH AND INSTRUCTIONAL NEEDS OF A LARGE UNIVERSITY.
4835|AT THE BEGINNING OF THE TITLE SERVICE FOR SCHOOL LIBRARIES.     SINCE 1979| A PROJECT GROUP OF THE DEUTSCHE BIBLIOTHEKSINSTITUT (GERMAN LIBRARYINSTITUTE) COMMITTEE ON SCHOOL LIBRARIES HAS BEEN INVOLVED IN PREPARATORY WORKTOWARDS A BOOK REVIEWING SERVICE SPECIFICALLY FOR SCHOOL LIBRARIES. THESERVICE AIMS TO COVER ALL BOOKS OTHER THAN TEXTBOOKS WHICH ARE SUITABLE FORUSE BY TEACHERS AND PUPILS IN EDUCATIONAL OR LEISURE PURSUITS. THE MATERIALCOVERED WILL CATER FOR ALL CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE AT GENERAL OR VOCATIONALSCHOOLS. A PRELIMINARY SURVEY WAS MADE OF SCHOOLS, LIBRARIES AND EDUCATIONALINSTITUTES IN ORDER TO ASCERTAIN REQUIREMENTS. 1| PILOT EDITION CONTAINING 200|REVIEWS WILL APPEAR IN FEB/MAR 82|, A 2|ND EDITION IS PLANNED FOR THE AUTUMN. IFTHE PROJECT IS REALISED, IT WILL ULTIMATELY COVER 2|,000| TITLES A YEAR.
4836|THE LEGAL DEPOSIT LEGISLATION AS THE BASIS OF THE NATIONAL COLLECTION OFPRINTED MATERIALS IN THE ROYAL LIBRARY.     PAPER PRESENTED AT THE 1|ST SWEDISH-SOVIET SEMINAR ON 'THE NATIONAL LIBRARYWITHIN A COUNTRY'S LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SERVICES' DEVELOPMENT PROSPECTS'HELD IN MOSCOW, 21|-22| NOV 78|. AFTER A SHORT INTRODUCTION INTO THE HISTORY OFLEGAL DEPOSIT LEGISLATION IN SCANDINAVIA, CONCENTRATES ON ITS DEVELOPMENT INSWEDEN. NEW LEGAL DEPOSIT LAW CAME INTO FORCE IN 1979|, THE PREVIOUSLEGISLATION HAVING BEEN PASSED IN 1949|. THE 2| LAWS ARE COMPARED ANDDIFFERENCES BETWEEN THEM AND REASONS FOR THE INTRODUCTION OF THE NEW LAW AREDISCUSSED. THE NEW LAW BRINGS CHANGES NOT ONLY IN THE NUMBER OF COPIESPUBLISHERS WILL NOW HAVE TO DEPOSIT OF BOOKS (NOW 7|, PREVIOUSLY 5|) BUT ALSOWIDENS THE RANGE OF DEPOSIT MATERIALS. ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES CONNECTEDWITH THE DEPOSITS ARE MENTIONED.
4837|TWO YEARS OF DEALING WITH SWEDISH PUBLICATIONS.     DESCRIBES HOW LINKOPING UNIVERSITY LIBRARY COPES WITH THE DEPOSIT COPIES OF200|,000| SWEDISH PUBLICATIONS PER YEAR WHICH IT HAS BEEN RECEIVING SINCE ITBECAME A DEPOSIT LIBRARY ON 1| JAN 79|. BY USING THE LIST OF SWEDISH PERIODICALSSOME PRIOR CATALOGUING COULD BE DONE. A PLAN FOR DISTRIBUTION OF THE MATERIALACCORDING TO SUBJECT TO THE 7| UNITS WHICH CONSTITUTE THE UNIVERSITY LIBRARYWAS DRAWN UP. AFTER 2| YEARS SOME PUBLISHERS ARE STILL NOT AWARE OF THEIR DUTYTO DELIVER, AND ROUTINES FOR CLAIMING HAVE HAD TO BE DEVELOPED. THE MONOGRAPHCOPIES RECEIVED ARE INTENDED AS REGIONAL COPIES FOR DISTRIBUTION TO OTHERINSTITUTIONS WITHIN THE REGION, OR COPIES FOR USE WITHIN THE UNIVERSITY; APOLICY OF WITHDRAWAL WAS DEVELOPED, AS NO ARCHIVAL DUTY EXISTS. PROBLEMS WERECAUSED BY THE NUMBER AND LATE DELIVERY OF PERIODICALS. HANDLING OF LEAFLETSAND OTHER EPHEMERA HAS PROVED MOST COMPLICATED AND TIME CONSUMING, AND THISMATERIAL REMAINS UNCATALOGUED. THE QUESTION OF ITS FUTURE NEEDS URGENTLY TO BEDECIDED.
4838|STUDIES IN THE INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGE OF PUBLICATIONS.     COLLECTION OF PAPERS PRESENTED AT MEETINGS OF THE IFLA SECTION ON THE EXCHANGEOF PUBLICATIONS, (NOW THE SECTION ON EXCHANGE AND ACQUISITION), ON SUBJECTSRELATING TO INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGE OF PUBLICATIONS.

4839|COST-EFFECTIVENESS OF SOVIET SERIAL EXCHANGES.     WHILE THE TRADITIONAL VIEW HAS BEEN THAT SOVIET PUBLICATIONS WERE BESTACQUIRED THROUGH EXCHANGES, A RECENT REVIEW OF SOVIET SERIALS AT DUKEUNIVERSITY LIBRARY SUGGESTS THAT THIS MAY NO LONGER BE AS TRUE AS IT ONCE WAS.THE AVAILABILITY OF SOVIET PUBLICATIONS THROUGH NORMAL TRADE CHANNELS HASINCREASED IN RECENT YEARS. BECAUSE OF THIS FACT, THE IMPORTANCE OF MAINTAININGEQUITABLE EXCHANGES IN ECONOMIC TERMS HAS INCREASED. OUR EXAMINATION HAS SHOWNTHAT IT SHOULD NOT BE ASSUMED THAT SUCH EXCHANGES ARE EQUITABLE. REGULARREVIEWS ARE RECOMMENDED TO SERVE THE NEEDS OF LIBRARIES BEST.
4840|RD MEETING OF SPECIALISTS FROM SOCIALIST COUNTRIES ON UNION CATALOGUES ANDINTERLIBRARY LOANS.R     EPORTS ON THE 3|RD MEETING HELD IN BERLIN 28|-30| OCT 80|.

4841|INTERLIBRARY LENDING OR DOCUMENT SUPPLY IN THE 1980|S.     EXAMINATION OF THE PROBLEMS OF INTERLIBRARY LOAN MADE IT CLEAR THAT THE ISSUELIBRARIES IN AUSTRALIA ARE FACING IS THE MUCH WIDER ONE OF DOCUMENT SUPPLY.WHILE THE INTERLIBRARY LENDING PROCEDURES WHICH HAD BEEN ESTABLISHED AS ANEXPRESSION OF VOLUNTARY COOPERATION BASED ON GOODWILL WERE ADEQUATE IN THE1930|S AND 1940|S, THEY BECAME INADEQUATE IN THE 1960|S AND 1970|S AND WILL BRINGDISASTER, IF RETAINED, IN THE 1980|S.

4844|SURVEY OF THE PERIODICAL STOCK AT THE LIBRARY OF THE INSTITUTE OF PUBLICHEALTH.     THE GROWTH OF THE HUNGARIAN INSTITUTE OF PUBLIC HEALTH'S OBJECTIVES ANDRESEARCH TEAM, THE LACK OF SPACE AND THE RISE IN JOURNAL PRICES INDUCED THELIBRARIANS TO EXAMINE THE USAGE OF JOURNALS. THEY WISHED TO ESTABLISH JOURNALSWHICH NEED NOT BE SUBSCRIBED TO ANY LONGER; JOURNALS WHICH COULD BE PLACED INREMOTE STORAGE; AND JOURNALS WHICH READERS REGULARLY REQUIRE BUT WHICH ARE NOTAVAILABLE IN THE LIBRARY. DATA WERE COLLECTED FROM 1| NOV 77| -30| APR 78|. AS ARESULT OF THE INVESTIGATION IT CAN BE LAID DOWN THAT THE LIBRARY CAN COMPLY,FROM ITS OWN STOCK, WITH A LARGE PART OF READERS' DEMANDS FOR JOURNALS. THESMALLER PART (29|%) OF THE STOCK FULFILS 77|% OF DEMANDS, THE LARGER PROPORTIONIS LITTLE USED. THE NUMBER OF JOURNALS NOT USED AT ALL IS SMALL. JOURNALS USEDLESS WILL BE PUT IN DISTANT STACKS; CURRENT JOURNALS AND OFTEN USED VOLUMESWILL BE STORED IN THE LIBRARY.

Y ET, IT IS NOTIMPERATIVE TO ADOPT AACR2| IMMEDIATELY. IT IS DESIRABLE TO WAIT AND SEE HOW USLIBRARIES ACCUSTOM THEMSELVES TO THE CHANGES AND TO SEE HOW LC IMPLEMENTS ANDINTERPRETS THE RULES. MEANWHILE IT IS SUGGESTED THAT ALL OPTIONS IN AACR2| BECHECKED, AND A UNIFORM ISRAELI PRACTICE BE ADOPTED. IT IS ALSO DESIRABLE THATTHE FEASIBILITY OF ADOPTING AACR2| AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF DESCRIPTION BY2|KIRYATH SEPHER1|, THE ISRAEL NATIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHY, BE CHECKED.
4881|OLD BOOKS' NEW RULES.     AN EXAMINATION OF THE ADDITIONAL RULES IN AACR2| FOR THE DESCRIPTION OF EARLYPRINTED MONOGRAPHS, CONCLUDING THAT PRE-1821| IMPRINTS ARE AMENABLE TO THEGENERAL RULES, THAT THEY DO NOT REQUIRE ANY MORE ELABORATE DESCRIPTION THANLATER BOOKS AND THAT THE PROVISION OF EXTRA BIBLIOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION IS OFDOUBTFUL UTILITY, EVEN WHERE THE NECESSARY EXPERTISE EXISTS TO PROVIDE IT.

REPORTS ON A CONFERENCE ON ON-LINE INFORMATION, ORGANISED BY THE BRITISHLIBRARY AND HELD IN SEPT 81|, WITH THE AIM OF EXAMINING RECENT EXPERIMENTS WITHON-LINE INFORMATION SERVICE IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES, SEEING THEM IN ACTION, ANDDISCUSSING RELATED ASPECTS SUCH AS FEES. DISTINGUISHES BETWEEN DIFFERENT FORMSOF INFORMATION' FACTS; AND INFORMATION ABOUT INFORMATION, SUCH AS PARTICULARBOOKS OR SUBJECTS. TO HANDLE THE STREAM OF INFORMATION, LIBRARIES NEED NEWTECHNOLOGY. ONLY IF INFORMATION IS ELECTRONICALLY REGISTERED CAN ALLINFORMATION BE ACCESSIBLE ON-LINE TO EVERYONE. PROBLEMS THEN ARISE OF ACTUALLYOBTAINING THE INFORMATION AND SELECTING THE AMOUNT NEEDED. STANDARDISATION OFCATALOGUING AND SYSTEMS IS NEEDED. THE HOLDINGS OF DANISH LIBRARIES SHOULD BEELECTRONICALLY REGISTERED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE TO MAKE THEM AVAILABLE ON-LINETO GROUPS WITHIN POLITICS, BUSINESS, AND EDUCATION AND TO INDIVIDUALS. THEBIROS EXPERIMENT IN ENGLAND SHOWS THAT PUBLIC LIBRARIES CAN HANDLE THIS TASK.THE NEW INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY COULD BE THE POINT OF COOPERATION BETWEEN ALLLIBRARIES.

IN MAR 80| A SURVEY OF READERS' OPINIONS ON THE FOROTHEKWAS CARRIED OUT; INFORMATION FROM 500| QUESTIONNAIRES IS ANALYSED IN DETAIL.MOST PEOPLE LIKED THE FOROTHEK; IT HELPED MANY READERS TO USE THE MAIN LIBRARYMORE EASILY AND TO DISCOVER FRESH INTERESTS.
4921|THE NON-DEPARTMENTAL LIBRARY.     DESCRIBES AN EXPERIMENT WITH A DEPARTMENT COMMON TO ADULTS AND CHILDREN IN THENEW LIBRARY IN EMMABODA, OPENED IN AUTUMN 80|. THE SHAPE OF THE NEW LIBRARYMADE IT DIFFICULT TO DIVIDE IT INTO DEPARTMENTS AND THE POSSIBILITY OF SAVINGSIN ACQUISITION OF MATERIAL SUITABLE FOR BOTH ADULTS AND CHILDREN, OR FOR YOUNGPEOPLE ON THE BORDERLINE OF ADULTHOOD PERSUADED THE LIBRARY TO TRY TOINTEGRATE THE MATERIAL. THE LIBRARY IS DIVIDED INTO FICTION AND NON-FICTION,WITH NON-FICTION BOOKS FOR CHILDREN PLACED AFTER THOSE FOR ADULTS ON THE SAMESHELF; ADULT FICTION AND CHILDREN'S FICTION HAVE THEIR OWN SHELVES, BUT IN THESAME PLACE IN THE HALL. AN AREA IN CONNECTION WITH THE ISSUE DESK CONTAINSPERIODICALS AND PICTURE BOOKS WITH SEATING FOR ALL AGES, INCLUDING HEADPHONESFOR CHILDREN. AFTER A YEAR THE EXPERIENCE HAS PROVED ENTIRELY POSITIVE.
4922|FREE ACCESS TO READING' A NEW POLICY OF OPPORTUNITIES.     CRITICISES THE PUBLIC LIBRARY POLICY OF DIVIDING CHILDREN'S BOOKS ACCORDING TOAGE LEVEL AS CONTRARY TO THE READER'S RIGHT TO SELECT MATERIAL APPROPRIATE TOHIS OWN ABILITIES. DRAWS ON RECENT STUDIES BY BRAZILIAN RESEARCHERS TOESTABLISH THAT FLUENCY IN READING IS A SKILL ACQUIRED PROGRESSIVELY AT ANINDIVIDUAL RATE DETERMINED BOTH BY AN INCREASE IN MECHANICAL FACILITY AND THEPROCESS OF MATURING. THUS THE READER'S AGE DOES NOT NECESSARILY CORRESPOND TOHIS READING CAPACITY, AND ARTIFICIAL DIVISIONS IMPOSED BY LIBRARIESEFFECTIVELY PREVENT ACCESS TO SUITABLE MATERIAL. THE ECONOMIC AND SOCIALADVANTAGES OF PERMITTING FREE CHOICE OF BOOKS ARE DISCUSSED IN RELATION TOPOPULARISING LIBRARIES AND MAXIMISING USE OF THEIR RESOURCES.

4932|USING THE TEXT TELEPHONE-SOMETHING FOR LIBRARIES?.     DESCRIBES THE TEXT TELEPHONE INSTALLED IN LANDSKRONA PUBLIC LIBRARY EARLY IN1981| FOR THE USE OF THE DEAF AND SPEECH IMPAIRED. IT CONSISTS OF 3| UNITS' ANORDINARY TELEPHONE, A KEYBOARD USED TO TYPE THE TEXT, AND A SCREEN MONITOR,WHICH RECEIVES AND TRANSMITS THE TEXT. THE HANDICAPPED PERSON NEEDS ALSO ASIGNAL RELAY, WHICH TRANSFORMS THE AUDIBLE TELEPHONE SIGNALS TO VISUALSIGNALS, AND HE MUST BE ABLE TO TYPE AS THE KEYBOARD IS THAT OF A STANDARDTYPEWRITER. DISABLED PEOPLE CAN CONTACT OTHERS WITH SIMILAR EQUIPMENT, BUTCONTACT TO AN ORDINARY TELEPHONE REQUIRES A TRANSFORMER. THE TELEPHONEDIRECTORY HAS SPECIAL MARKINGS FOR TEXT TELEPHONES. EXPANSION OF THE SERVICE,WHICH PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY TO REACH NEW AND ISOLATED GROUPS, HAS BEENLIMITED BY LACK OF FINANCE.
4933|READING AND SUCCESSFUL LIVING.

4935|LITERATURE AND READING IN THE GERMAN DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC.     STATISTICS FOR THE LAST 10| YEARS IN EAST GERMANY REFLECT THE SUCCESS ACHIEVEDBY THE PUBLISHING INDUSTRY IN STIMULATING PUBLIC INTEREST IN READING AND INTRYING TO SATISFY READERS' NEEDS. THE IMPORTANCE OF PROVIDING THE WIDESTPOSSIBLE RANGE OF MATERIAL ON DIFFERENT SUBJECTS AND IN DIFFERENT LANGUAGES ISRECOGNISED. FOREIGN MATERIAL MOST IN DEMAND IS THAT FROM THE USSR, FOLLOWED BYWORKS FROM OTHER COMMUNIST COUNTRIES AND FROM THE THIRD WORLD. NATURALLY AWIDE RANGE OF CONTEMPORARY DOMESTIC LITERATURE IS ALSO AVAILABLE. IN 1980|,LIBRARY STOCKS TOTALLED 80| MILLION ITEMS AND THE BOOKTRADE TURNOVER HASINCREASED BY 32|% DURING THE LAST 5| YEARS. CLOSE LINKS HAVE BEEN DEVELOPEDBETWEEN AUTHORS, PUBLISHERS AND THE PUBLIC. MORE RESEARCH INTO READING HABITSAND COMMUNICATION THROUGH LITERATURE IS REQUIRED.
4936|A VILLAGE WITH ONLY THREE BOOKS.     DISCUSSES A SHORT STORY BY A CONTEMPORARY BRAZILIAN WRITER DEPICTING AFICTITIOUS BRAZILIAN VILLAGE AT THE TURN OF THE CENTURY WHERE ONLY 3| BOOKS AREAVAILABLE, CONTRASTING THE CULTURAL DEPRIVATION OF THE VILLAGERS WITH THE RICHLITERARY EXPERIENCE OF CHARACTERS DEPICTED IN EUROPEAN FICTION.

CONTACT WITH VARIOUSORGANISATIONS WAS MADE, ABOVE ALL THE PUBLIC LIBRARY COMMISSION. IN THEREGIONAL PROJECT THE EMPHASIS WAS TO BE ON LOCAL INVOLVEMENT. THE PROJECT,CALLED THE DALA PROJECT, IS TO START IN THE AUTUMN 81| IN THE KOPPARBERG REGIONAND HAS 4| CORNERSTONES' SCHOOLS, PUBLIC LIBRARIES, STUDY CIRCLES AND MASSMEDIA. THE PROJECT SHOULD LEAD TO COOPERATION AND BETTER USE OF RESOURCES, BUTALSO TO SUGGESTIONS FOR MODELS FOR FUTURE LOCAL LIBRARY  SERVICES AND FOR THEOPINION FORMING ROLE OF THE CULTURAL COUNCIL.
4938|AN EXAMINATION OF BOOK BUYERS AND LIBRARY USERS.     VERY FEW PEOPLE EITHER ONLY BUY THEIR BOOKS OR ONLY OBTAIN THEM FROM A LIBRARYAND MANY PEOPLE BUY BOOKS AS OFTEN AS THEY BORROW THEM. LIBRARY USERS WHOBORROW FEW BOOKS BUY A LARGER PROPORTION OF THEIR BOOKS THAN LIBRARY USERS WHOBORROW MANY BOOKS. HOWEVER, WHEREAS OVER 1|/2| THE POPULATION OF GERMANY BUYBOOKS, ONLY ABOUT 1|/4| USE PUBLIC LIBRARIES. INVESTIGATIONS HAVE REVEALED THATIMPORTANT INFLUENCES ON BEHAVIOUR REGARDING THE USE OF BOOKS INCLUDE THE HOMEBACKGROUND, SCHOOL AND GENERAL SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT. AN INDIVIDUAL'S SENSE OFVALUES ALSO PLAYS ITS PART, OFTEN INFLUENCED BY THE MEDIA AND COMMUNICATIONPOSSIBILITIES. PERHAPS THE MAIN INFLUENCE IS THE SOCIAL LEARNING PROCESS ANDAN INDIVIDUAL'S OWN ATTITUDE TOWARDS IT. THERE ARE STILL NUMEROUS UNEXPLOREDPOSSIBILITIES FOR INFLUENCING CHILDREN AND ADULTS IN THEIR USE OF BOOKS.
4939|WHAT DO CHILDREN KNOW ABOUT CHILDREN'S BOOKS?.     PRESENTS THE RESPONSES OF 8| CHILDREN, AGED BETWEEN 6| AND 11|, TO QUESTIONSABOUT THEIR READING, DESIGNED TO ELUCIDATE THEIR PREFERENCES AND DISLIKES. THEBOOKS CITED ARE MAINLY CONTEMPORARY BRAZILIAN WORKS. NO BIBLIOGRAPHICALDETAILS ARE GIVEN.
4940|CARRY OUT A READING CAMPAIGN IN YOUR CLASS.     A READING CAMPAIGN WAS CARRIED OUT IN CLASS 3|B OF ISLEV SCHOOL IN RODOVRE,DENMARK, IN WHICH THE PUPILS AIMED TO READ AT HOME A TOTAL OF 200| BOOKS FROMTHE SCHOOL LIBRARY IN 9| WEEKS. THE READERS WERE GIVEN A TIME IN WHICH TO READEACH BOOK AND USED A FORM TO REPORT ON THE CONTENT, ILLUSTRATIONS AND EASE OFREADING. THESE COMMENTS WERE READ TO THE CLASS EACH WEEK. THE 1|ST BATCH OFBOOKS WAS CHOSEN BY THE 2| TEACHERS CONCERNED, THE NEXT BY TEACHERS AND PUPILSTOGETHER IN THE LIBRARY, AND THE LAST MAINLY BY THE PUPILS THEMSELVES. IF NOBOOK ATTRACTED A CHILD, HE OR SHE COULD CHOSE 1| FROM THE LIBRARY WITH HELPFROM THE LIBRARIAN. A 'BOOK THERMOMETER' IN THE CLASSROOM SHOWED PROGRESS INREADING THE 200| BOOKS. AN EXHIBITION ON THE PROJECT WAS MOUNTED IN THE LIBRARYAND A TAPE WAS MADE OF SOME OF THE READERS' OPINIONS. THE CAMPAIGN STIMULATEDINTEREST IN READING AND IN BORROWING BOOKS FROM THE SCHOOL LIBRARY AND SOMECHILDREN WHO HAD NEVER READ A BOOK BEFORE NOW DID SO, SOMETIMES AS A RESULT OFTHE RECORDED COMMENTS. THE AIM WAS FULFILLED, ALL 200| BOOKS BEING READ DURINGTHE 9|-WEEK PERIOD.
4941|THE ROMANIZATION OF CYRILLIC SCRIPT.     IN TERMS OF PUBLISHED LITERATURE RUSSIAN LANGUAGE MATERIAL IS 2|ND ONLY TOENGLISH LANGUAGE PRODUCTION. HOWEVER, THERE IS STILL NO GENERALLY ACCEPTEDSCHEME IN THE WESTERN WORLD FOR CONVERTING CYRILLIC CHARACTERS INTO ROMANSCRIPT. TRANSCRIPTION, BY WHICH CYRILLIC CHARACTERS ARE ROMANIZED INTOPHONEMES, GIVES GOOD RESULTS FOR PRONUNCIATION BUT LEADS TO A NUMBER OFALTERNATIVE SPELLINGS, WHILST TRANSLITERATION, BY WHICH A SINGLE ROMANCHARACTER IS SUBSTITUTED FOR EACH CYRILLIC CHARACTER LEADS TO PRONUNCIATIONDIFFICULTIES. WITH THE GROWTH IN SCHEMES FOR CATALOGUE AUTOMATION IT ISESSENTIAL THAT A SOLUTION IS FOUND TO THIS PROBLEM. RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THATTHE ISO STANDARD OFFERS THE BEST SOLUTION ALTHOUGH THIS HAS UNFORTUNATELYFOUND LITTLE FAVOUR IN THE USA AND UK.
4942|THE DEVELOPMENT OF INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION IN THE FIELD OF BIBLIOGRAPHY.     THE DEVELOPMENT OF INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION IN THE FIELD OF BIBLIOGRAPHY ISDIVIDED INTO 3| PERIODS' ORGANISATION AND FORMATION (END OF 19|TH-BEGINNING OF20|TH CENTURY); FOUNDATION OF BIBLIOGRAPHIC ORGANISATIONS AND THE CONDUCT OFTHE FIRST COOPERATED RESEARCH (1919|-1939|); AND WIDE COOPERATION AMONGBIBLIOGRAPHERS IN THE FRAMEWORK OF INTERNATIONAL AND REGIONAL ORGANISATIONSAND THE REALISATION OF INTERNATIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHICAL PROGRAMMES (FROM 1945|). ABRIEF ACCOUNT IS GIVEN OF DEVELOPMENTS WITHIN EACH PERIOD UP TO 1970|S.
4943|COMPUTERISATION OF THE CURRENT NATIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHY.     A SCHEME FOR THE COMPUTERISATION OF THE CURRENT NATIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHY INBULGARIA HAS BEEN IN PROGRESS SINCE 1978| AND ALL MAJOR SCIENTIFIC AND CENTRALREGIONAL LIBRARIES ARE PARTICIPATING IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE SCHEME. 8|SERIES ARE PLANNED, INCLUDING A BIBLIOGRAPHY OF CONTEMPORARY BULGARIANLITERATURE, AND BIBLIOGRAPHIES OF PUBLICATIONS ISSUED BY VARIOUS GOVERNMENTAGENCIES, DISSERTATIONS, GRAMOPHONE RECORDS, AND BULGARIAN PERIODICALS ANDARTICLES IN DAILY PAPERS. THERE WILL ALSO BE A BIBLIOGRAPHY OF FOREIGNLITERATURE ON BULGARIA, TOGETHER WITH 1| OF BULGARIAN BIBLIOGRAPHIES. THEFREQUENCY OF PUBLICATION WILL RANGE FROM 1| WEEK, AS IN THE CASE OF CATALOGUECARDS, THROUGH BI-WEEKLY, MONTHLY AND QUARTERLY BULLETINS TO ANNUAL INDEXES OREVEN CUMULATIVE INDEXES PUBLISHED ONCE EVERY FEW YEARS.
