EACH TITLE CAN BE ASSESSED INRELATION TO THE OTHERS AND THE DATA FOR ALL TITLES CAN BE CUMULATED SO THATDECISIONS CAN BE MADE AT VARIOUS CUTOFF POINTS. SIMPLE RANKING OF TITLES BYRAW USE (RUR) MAY BE INADEQUATE AND SHOULD BE ADJUSTED BY SOME MEASURE TOALLOW FOR HOW MUCH OF THE TITLE IS AVAILABLE TO THE USER AT THE TIME OF THECOLLECTION OF THE USE DATA. IF THE RAW-USE FREQUENCY OF A TITLE IS DIVIDED BYTHE ACTUAL LINEAR SHELF SPACE OF THE TITLE'S FILE, A 'DENSITY-OF-USE'FREQUENCY IS OBTAINED. IF THESE FREQUENCIES ARE THEN RANKED, A 'DENSITY-OF-USERANK' (DUR) IS FORMED. SOME DIFFERENCES BETWEEN RUR AND DUR HAVE BEENANALYSED.

DISCUSSES THE QUALITY OF MICROFORMS' WHY THIS ISIMPORTANT, STANDARDISATION, AND WAYS AND MEANS OF CONTROLLING QUALITY;PRODUCTION' THE RELATIVE ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF USING OUTSIDEAGENCIES OR ESTABLISHING A LABORATORY WITHIN THE ORGANISATION, TAKING SHOTS,DEVELOPING FILM, AND STORAGE METHODS; AND CONSERVATION TECHNIQUES.
5095|MICROGRAPHY IN THE DOCUMENTATION FIELD. ORGANISATION AND MANAGEMENT.A PRACTICAL PROGRAMME FOR INTRODUCING MICROGRAPHY INTO AN ALREADY EXISTINGCOLLECTION. THE ADVANTAGES OF MICROGRAPHY IN THE DOCUMENTATION FIELD AREDISCUSSED, WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO CURRENT OBJECTIONS TO ITS USE, ANDSTRATEGY FOR CIRCUMVENTING OPPOSITION SUMMARISED IN 5| PRECEPTS. EXAMINES' WHATDOCUMENTS TO SELECT FOR COPYING; WHAT KIND OF MICROFORM TO USE; HOW TO PREPAREDOCUMENTS FOR COPYING; PRODUCTION OF MICROFORMS; SELECTION OF A MICROFORMREADER; AND EXPLOITATION OF MICROFORM HOLDINGS.
5096|MICROFORMS' THE TREND OF APPLICATIONS (IN CHINESE).REVIEWS MICROFORM DEVELOPMENTS AS THEY RELATE TO LIBRARY APPLICATIONS.DISCUSSES MICROFORM AS AN EFFECTIVE INFORMATION MEDIUM AND THE TREND OF ITSBROAD APPLICATIONS, THE INDEXING METHODS AND RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS.
5097|MICROFORMS AS LIBRARY TOOLS.DESCRIBES WHAT IS MEANT BY MICROPUBLISHING AND OUTLINES THE BENEFITS OFMICROFORMS AS LIBRARY MEDIA INCLUDING REDUCED PRINTING COSTS, QUICKERDISSEMINATION, EASIER RETRIEVAL, SPACE SAVING, EASE OF HANDLING, FILEUNIFORMITY, INCREASED DURABILITY AND RAPID UPDATING. DISCUSSES THE NATURE OF,AND ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF THE VARIOUS TYPES OF MICROFORM.
5098|USE OF MICROFILM IN FRENCH PROVINCIAL ARCHIVES. THIRTY-FIVE YEARS' EXPERIENCE.FOLLOWING A PRELIMINARY DETAILED ACCOUNT OF THE INTRODUCTION OF MICROFILM INFRENCH PROVINCIAL ARCHIVES AND ITS GRADUAL INTEGRATION INTO NORMAL ARCHIVEMANAGEMENT PRACTICE, WITH REFERENCE TO THE ELABORATION OF OFFICIAL NORMS ANDREGULATIONS FOR USE, STATISTICAL EVIDENCE OF THE EXPANSION OF THE PHOTOGRAPHICSERVICE IS GIVEN, SHOWING PROGRESSIVE INCREASE IN WORKSHOP SPACE, SPECIALISTPERSONNEL EMPLOYED, AND MICROFILM FOOTAGE PRODUCTION, WITH REFERENCE TORELEVANT STATE PUBLICATIONS. THE RECENTLY IMPLEMENTED PROGRAMME OF DUPLICATINGIMPORTANT HOLDINGS IS BRIEFLY DESCRIBED, AND COMMENTS MADE ON ATTITUDES INGENERAL TO USE OF MICROFILM, POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE. CONCLUDES THAT TO MAINTAINEFFICIENCY, THE FRENCH ARCHIVE SERVICE NEEDS TO KEEP ABREAST OF TECHNOLOGICALDEVELOPMENT, SECURE ITS FINANCIAL BASIS, AND SOLVE THE LEGAL PROBLEMS OFREPROGRAPHY.
5099|STANDARDS FOR SPEAKERS.A PROPER SOUND SYSTEM IS A CRITICAL CONSIDERATION FOR ALL AUDIO LIBRARIANS ANDARCHIVISTS. PRESENTS GUIDELINES FOR SPEAKER SELECTION TO PRODUCE THE MOSTAUTHENTIC REPRODUCTION. SPEAKERS SHOULD' HAVE A WIDE FREQUENCYRANGE-APPROXIMATELY 25|-16|,000| HERTZ OR BETTER; HAVE A FLAT RESPONSE-03| DB ORLESS; HAVE LOW INTERMODULATION DISTORTION-0|.5|% OR LESS; HAVE MINIMALDIFFERENCES IN SPEAKER ARRIVAL TIME-1| MILLISECOND OR LESS; AND BE PROPERLYPLACED FOR BEST RESPONSE.
5100|ARCHIVES APPEAL TO THE RECORD MANUFACTURERS.AT THE JOINT CONFERENCE OF THE INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF SOUND ARCHIVES ANDTHE INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF MUSIC LIBRARIES, CAMBRIDGE, 1980|, THEIR JOINTAGREEMENT ON THE AMOUNT OF INFORMATION TO BE PROVIDED ON RECORD SLEEVES BYRECORD MANUFACTURERS WAS DISCUSSED. IF THE RIGHT INFORMATION IS PROVIDED, ARECORD'S VALUE AS AN ACADEMIC SOURCE INCREASES. THE INFORMATION SHOULDINCLUDE' THE DATE OF RECORDING; THE PLACE OF RECORDING; NAMES OF PUBLISHERS,ARRANGERS AND STATEMENTS ON ABBREVIATIONS OR DEVIATIONS IN THE SCORE; NAMES OFPERFORMERS; PLAYING TIME FOR EACH SECTION; NAMES OF CONDUCTORS, SOUNDENGINEERS AND PRODUCERS. THE AGREEMENT IS BEING DISCUSSED WITH MANUFACTURERSIN GERMANY, FRANCE, SCANDINAVIA AND THE UK.
5101|ORAL ARCHIVES' SOME REFLECTIONS ON CREATING THEM.DESCRIBES METHODS USED IN THE PRIVATE ARCHIVES DEPARTMENT OF THE FRENCHNATIONAL ARCHIVES FOR RECORDING ORAL TESTIMONIES. DETAILS ARE GIVEN OF THEEQUIPMENT USED, WITH PRACTICAL ADVICE ON CONDUCTING INTERVIEWS TO ENSURE GOODQUALITY RECORDINGS, AND RELEVANT CONTENT WITH MINIMUM FATIGUE FOR THEPARTICIPANTS. THE ESSENTIAL PRELIMINARY DATA TO BE RECORDED ON EVERY TAPE FORARCHIVE IDENTIFICATION ARE LISTED. THE IMPORTANCE OF ORAL TESTIMONIES INSUPPLEMENTING AND EXPLAINING THE CONTENTS OF TRADITIONAL ARCHIVES ISILLUSTRATED HERE WITH REFERENCE TO A SERIES OF INTERVIEWS RECORDED FROMDESCENDANTS OF FRENCH POLITICIANS IN THE COURSE OF A SURVEY OF THEIR PERSONALPAPERS.
5102|LIBRARIES AND COMPUTER MATERIALS.THE SEMINAR HELD AT DORKING, 13|-14| MAR 81|, DISCUSSED THE IMPLICATIONS FORLIBRARIES OF THE RAPID GROWTH IN THE SCOPE AND VARIETY OF COMPUTER MATERIALS,ESPECIALLY MICROCOMPUTER SOFTWARE. EXPLORED THE POSSIBLE CONTRIBUTIONS OF THELIBRARY/INFORMATION PROFESSIONS TO SOLVING THE PROBLEMS OF CATALOGUING,INDEXING AND RETRIEVING INFORMATION ABOUT SUCH MATERIALS.
5103|NORTH AFRICAN JEWISH PERIODICALS AS A FIELD OF STUDY-THE STATE OF THE ART.THE AUTHOR RECENTLY COMPILED AN INVENTORY OF NORTH AFRICAN JEWISH PERIODICALSFOUND IN 4| MAJOR JERUSALEM COLLECTIONS. WHILE PREPARING THIS 1|ST LISTING OF145| TITLES, HE ENCOUNTERED SEVERAL PROBLEMS, WHICH HE SHARES WITH LIBRARIANS.FIRSTLY, THERE WERE OFTEN DISCREPANCIES BETWEEN HOLDINGS LISTED IN THECATALOGUE AND ACTUAL COLLECTIONS, WHICH ONLY A FIRST-HAND CHECK OF EACH ISSUECOULD RECTIFY. MOREOVER, THE CATALOGUE IS NOT A SATISFACTORY SOURCE FORCHANGES OF EDITORS, MANAGERS-OR EVEN SUBTITLES AND OTHER TITLES (OFTENAPPEARING IN OTHER LANGUAGES). THE CENTRAL ZIONIST ARCHIVES POSED A SPECIALPROBLEM' NEWSPAPERS AS A RULE ARE TRANSFERRED TO ITS LIBRARY COLLECTION, BUTSOME ISSUES OF SHORT-LIVED ZIONIST PERIODICALS WERE APPENDED TO CORRESPONDENCEAND REMAIN IN THE ARCHIVAL COLLECTION, WITHOUT BEING LISTED IN THE LIBRARYCATALOGUE.
5104|THE DEVELOPMENT AND DISSEMINATION OF GERMAN AND FOREIGN LANGUAGE LITERATUREFOR CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE; SELECTED EXAMPLES. PART 2|.A DETAILED DESCRIPTION IS GIVEN OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF CHILDREN'S LITERATURE INTHE USA, THE HIGH STANDARDS OF RESEARCH INTO THE SUBJECT AND THE CONCERN TORAISE THE STANDARD OF CHILDREN'S LITERATURE. THE CHILDREN'S SERVICE DIVISIONOF THE AMERICAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION HAS ORGANISED SERVICES TO HELP THEBACKWARD AND UNDERPRIVILEGED BY BRINGING THEM INTO CONTACT WITH GOODLITERATURE. THE BEST BIBLIOGRAPHIES AND OTHER REFERENCE BOOKS ON THE SUBJECTARE DISCUSSED. BRIEFER SURVEYS ARE ALSO INCLUDED ON THE PUBLISHING OFCHILDREN'S LITERATURE, PAST AND PRESENT, AND ON LIBRARY WORK WITH CHILDREN INCANADA, SWEDEN, PANAMA, SPAIN, BRAZIL, CHILE, AUSTRALIA, EGYPT, GHANA, ISRAELAND TURKEY. FOR PART 1|, 2|SEE1| 82|/5467|.
5105|NORMS AND FUNCTIONS IN CITATION' THE VIEW OF JOURNAL EDITORS AND REFEREES INPSYCHOLOGY.THE VIEWS OF PSYCHOLOGY JOURNAL EDITORS AND EDITORIAL ADVISORY BOARD MEMBERSWERE SOUGHT ON THE NATURE AND FUNCTIONS OF CITATION. INFORMATION WAS GATHEREDUSING AN 18| ITEM QUESTIONNAIRE. THE FEELING EMERGED THAT CITATION WAS A SKILLWHICH AUTHORS ACQUIRED OSMOTICALLY. CONSIDERABLE SUPPORT WAS GIVEN TO THE IDEATHAT EDITORS AND REFEREES COULD PLAY A MORE POSITIVE ROLE IN ESTABLISHING ANDENCOURAGING CONSISTENCY IN AUTHORS' CITATION PRACTICES. WHERE APPROPRIATE,REPLIES HAVE BEEN INTERPRETED IN THE LIGHT OF PREVAILING THEORY. PRACTICALREASONS FOR FURTHER RESEARCH IN THIS AREA ARE ALSO CONSIDERED.
5106|THE CODEX CAESAREUS UPSALIENSIS.DESCRIBES A MANUSCRIPT, CONTAINING THE 4| GOSPELS IN LATIN WHICH WAS PRODUCEDIN 1050| BY THE MONASTERY OF ECHTERNACH ON THE ORDER OF EMPEROR HENRY III ANDTHEN SENT TO THE MONASTERY OF GOSLAR; IN 1632|, DURING THE 30| YEARS' WAR, ITWAS TAKEN AS WAR BOOTY TO SWEDEN AND IN 1805| WAS GIVEN TO UPPSALA UNIVERSITY.IN 1971| A FACSIMILE EDITION OF 500| COPIES WAS PRODUCED TO CELEBRATE THE 350|THANNIVERSARY OF UPPSALA UNIVERSITY LIBRARY. A DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THEPRODUCTION METHODS FOR THESE FACSIMILES IS INCLUDED. EACH COPY IS ACCOMPANIEDBY A COMPREHENSIVE ESSAY ON THE MANUSCRIPT BY CARL NORDENFALK, ANINTERNATIONAL AUTHORITY ON MEDIEVAL MANUSCRIPTS.
5107|SOUND CASSETTES IN THE LIBRARY. (IV) RELIGIOUS CASSETTES IN THE LIBRARY.THE RANGE OF CASSETTES ON RELIGIOUS SUBJECTS AVAILABLE ON THE MARKET ISRELATIVELY SMALL. SOME RELIGIOUS MATERIAL IS ONLY AVAILABLE ON RECORDS, WHICHARE LESS USEFUL THAN CASSETTES IN LIBRARIES, BUT THE PRODUCTS OF A FEWIMPORTANT MANUFACTURERS SHOULD FORM THE BASIS OF A LIBRARY'S STOCK.MANUFACTURERS' LISTS PROVIDE THE ONLY SOURCE OF INFORMATION FOR THE LIBRARIANSINCE NO COMPREHENSIVE TOPICAL INDEX OF RELIGIOUS CASSETTES EXISTS. CASSETTEMATERIAL AVAILABLE IN GERMANY CONTAINING BIBLE READINGS AND DRAMATISATIONS,TALKS ON THE CATHOLIC FAITH, THE CHRISTIAN WAY OF LIFE, MEDITATION AND PRAYERIS DESCRIBED. EACH CASSETTE SHOULD BE EXAMINED INDIVIDUALLY CONCERNING ITSSUBJECT CONTENT, AIMS, SUITABILITY FOR THE TARGET GROUP AND THE QUALITY OFMUSIC, LANGUAGE AND TECHNICAL PRODUCTION. (FOR PREVIOUS PARTS, SEE 82|/5287|,82|/5291| AND 82|/5288|).
5108|THE LOMENIE DE BRIENNE COLLECTION AND OTHER FRENCH LEGAL DOCUMENTS AT HARVARD.BRIEFLY DESCRIBES HOLDINGS IN HARVARD UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES OF HISTORICALFRENCH LEGAL DOCUMENTS, INCLUDING THE LOMENIE DE BRIENNE COLLECTION, ANDCATALOGUES OF THE HOLDINGS. SUGGESTS THAT THESE DOCUMENTS SERVED A NEWSFUNCTION AND WERE DISTRIBUTED OUTSIDE LEGAL CIRCLES.
5109|CENTRALISATION AND TREATMENT OF MAIL, DOCUMENTATION, INFORMATION AND ARCHIVES'THE EXPERIENCE OF THE GENEVA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS.AN ACCOUNT OF THE PROCEDURES ADOPTED FOLLOWING THE CONCENTRATION OF ALLSERVICES IN ONE BUILDING. DETAILS ARE GIVEN OF THE SYSTEM EVOLVED FOR HANDLINGBOTH CURRENT AND SPECIAL MAIL, SPECIFYING ROUTINES FOR DEALING WITHCOMMUNICATIONS FROM STATE DEPARTMENTS; THE TASKS ASSIGNED TO THE DOCUMENTATIONCENTRE; AND ARCHIVE OPERATIONS IN RELATION TO SUBJECT FIELDS COVERED, SHOWINGHOW UDC IS USED. ARCHIVE CRITERIA FOR CONSERVATION AND DESTRUCTION OFDOCUMENTS, AND USE OF MICROFILMING, ARE DESCRIBED, AND CATALOGUING TECHNIQUESAND EQUIPMENT USED FOR 16|MM MICROFILMING SPECIFIED. RELEVANT STANDARDDOCUMENTATION RELATING TO ALL ASPECTS OF THE SERVICES IS APPENDED TOILLUSTRATE THE SYSTEM.
5110|AUTHOR COCITATION: A LITERATURE MEASURE OF INTELLECTUAL STRUCTURE.SHOWS THAT THE MAPPING OF A PARTICULAR AREA OF SCIENCE, IN THIS CASEINFORMATION SCIENCE, CAN BE DONE USING AUTHORS AS UNITS OF ANALYSIS AND THECOCITATIONS OF PAIRS OF AUTHORS AS THE VARIABLE THAT INDICATES THEIR'DISTANCES' FROM EACH OTHER. THE ANALYSIS ASSUMES THAT THE MORE 2| AUTHORS ARECITED TOGETHER, THE CLOSER THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THEM. THE RAW DATA ARECOCITATION COUNTS DRAWN ON-LINE FROM SOCIAL SCISEARCH (2|SOCIAL SCIENCESCITATION INDEX1|) OVER THE PERIOD 1972|-79|. COCITATION ANALYSIS OF AUTHORSOFFERS A NEW TECHNIQUE THAT MIGHT CONTRIBUTE TO THE UNDERSTANDING OFINTELLECTUAL STRUCTURE IN THE SCIENCES AND POSSIBLY IN OTHER AREAS TO THEEXTENT THAT THOSE AREAS RELY ON SERIAL PUBLICATIONS.
5111|COINCIDENCE METHODS AND THE TWO-LEVEL CONCEPT.COINCIDENCE METHODS ARE APPLIED TO INVESTIGATIONS INTO RANK DISTRIBUTION INTHE REPORT LITERATURE OF THE INTERNATIONAL NUCLEAR INFORMATION SYSTEM (INIS)AND A 2|-LEVEL CONCEPT USED FOR DISCUSSION OF RESULTS IN THE PRESENT ANDPREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS. TRANSITIONS BETWEEN MACRO AND MICRO INFORMATIONLEVELS, WITH REFERENCE TO CONSTANT FORMS OF COMMUNICATION, ARE COMPARED WITHEACH OTHER AS WELL AS TRANSITIONS BETWEEN DIFFERENT FORMS OF COMMUNICATION ATCONSTANT LEVELS. THE DISAPPEARANCE OF THE 'INFORMATION AVALANCHE' FOR THEHIGHLY SPECIALISED INFORMATION SCIENTIST, THE GREATER EFFECTIVITY OF REPORTLITERATURE AS COMPARED WITH PERIODICAL LITERATURE IN THE FIELDS OF NUCLEARRESEARCH AND THE NONCOMPATIBILITY OF MACRO AND MICRO INFORMATION LEVELS CAN BEQUANTITATIVELY CONFIRMED. THE QUESTION REMAINS, HOW MICROLEVEL DISTRIBUTIONCAN BE CHANGED INTO MACROLEVEL DISTRIBUTION.
5112|PATTERNS OF JOURNAL USE IN A DEPARTMENTAL LIBRARY' A CITATION ANALYSIS.CITATION ANALYSIS OF FACULTY PUBLICATIONS, DOCTORAL DISSERTATIONS, ANDPRELIMINARY DOCTORAL QUALIFYING BRIEFS PRODUCED BY FACULTY AND STUDENTS OF THEBIOLOGY DEPARTMENT, TEMPLE UNIVERSITY, IS USED TO ASSESS JOURNAL USE IN THEBIOLOGY LIBRARY DURING THE YEARS 1975|-77|. THERE ARE 3|,739| CITATIONS TO 336|JOURNALS IN THE COMBINED SOURCES RANKING. THE DISTRIBUTION OF CITATIONS INEACH USER GROUP RANKING AND THE COMBINED SOURCES RANKING TAKES THE FORM OF ABRADFORD DISTRIBUTION. 60| HIGHLY CITED TITLES ARE EXAMINED IN DETAIL.DISSERTATION CITATIONS ARE DEPENDENT ON ACTIVE FACULTY PARTICIPATION IN THEDOCTORAL PROGRAMME. CITATIONS IN QUALIFYING BRIEFS COVER A BROADER RANGE OFTOPICS AND INTERESTS THAN EITHER OF THE OTHER 2| SOURCES. CITATION FREQUENCIESOF VOLUMES PUBLISHED IN THE PERIODS 1960|-69| AND 1970|-77| ARE EXAMINED. SEVERALCOLLECTION MAINTENANCE AND DEVELOPMENT DECISIONS HAVE BEEN MADE, BASED ON THERESULTS OF THIS STUDY. CITATION ANALYSIS IS SHOWN TO BE A USEFUL TOOL INASSESSING ACTUAL AND POTENTIAL JOURNAL USE BY A HETEROGENEOUS CLIENTELE IN ADEPARTMENTAL LIBRARY.
5113|THE USE OF PERIODICAL LITERATURE IN A NORWEGIAN DENTAL LIBRARY.PERIODICAL LOANS, PHOTOCOPY REQUESTS, AND READING ROOM USE OF BACK VOLUMES OFPERIODICALS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF BERGEN DENTAL SCHOOL LIBRARY WERE REGISTEREDDURING A 12| MONTH PERIOD. LOANS WERE SORTED BY TITLE AND YEAR, AND TITLES WEREGROUPED BY SPECIALITY AND LANGUAGE. TOTAL BORROWING WAS 2|,242| AND THE ANNUALAGING FACTOR WAS 0|.89| (HALF-LIFE 5|.8| YEARS). 12| PERIODICALS ACCOUNTED FOR 50|%OF TOTAL BORROWING. WHILE MOST SPECIALISED DENTAL JOURNALS HAD A LOWER AGINGFACTOR THAN DENTAL JOURNALS AS A WHOLE, ORTHODONTIC JOURNALS HAD AN AGINGFACTOR OF 0|.92| (HALF-LIFE 8|.7| YEARS). NON-ENGLISH LANGUAGE JOURNALS ACCOUNTEDFOR 22|% OF BORROWING, SCANDINAVIAN LANGUAGE TITLES (16|% OF BORROWING) HAD ALOWER AGING FACTOR (0|.87|, HALF-LIFE 5|.1| YEARS) AND SEEMED TO BE USED MORE ASNEWS JOURNALS.
5114|BULGARIAN AND FOREIGN LITERATURE ON ENERGY IN THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OFBULGARIA.A CRITICAL APPRAISAL OF LITERATURE ON ENERGY, AVAILABLE AT PRESENT, INBULGARIAN LIBRARIES. ALL POSSIBLE ASPECTS ARE COVERED. FOREIGN PUBLICATIONS INTHIS IMPORTANT FIELD WERE PREDOMINANTLY FRENCH AND GERMAN IN THE 1940|S, BUTNOWADAYS, 60|% IS WRITTEN IN RUSSIAN FOLLOWED BY MATERIALS IN ENGLISH. DURINGTHE PAST 20| YEARS, EVEN THE CENTRAL REGIONAL LIBRARIES HAVE ESTABLISHEDSPECIAL COLLECTIONS ON ENERGY. MAJOR LIBRARIES HAVE SPECIALISED IN 3| AREAS.FIRSTLY, THE CENTRAL TECHNICAL LIBRARY AND THE LIBRARY OF THE BULGARIANACADEMY OF SCIENCES HAVE BUILT UP THEORETICAL COLLECTIONS AND OTHERS OFSPECIALIST INTEREST, E.G. ON NUCLEAR ENERGY. SECONDLY, REFERENCE PUBLICATIONSARE TO BE FOUND MAINLY AT THE CYRIL AND METHODIUS NATIONAL LIBRARY WHILETHIRDLY TECHNICAL COLLEGES AND OTHER ESTABLISHMENTS OF HIGHER TECHNICALEDUCATION CONCENTRATE ON ALL ASPECTS OF ELECTRICAL POWER, INSTALLATIONS,INSTRUMENTS, AND SO ON. IN ALL LIBRARIES, THE STAFF RESPONSIBLE FOR NEWACQUISITIONS MUST BEAR IN MIND THE LATEST TRENDS, E.G. CONVERSION OF CHEMICALENERGY INTO LIGHT, WHERE, SO FAR, THE LITERATURE AVAILABLE IS ALMOSTNEGLIGIBLE.
5115|THE UNIVERSITY IS A SCHOOL OF READING.STUDENTS AT THE STUDENCHESKOE KONSTRUKTORSKOE BYURO AVIAMODELIZMA, (STUDENTS'AIRCRAFT MODELLING CONSTRUCTION BUREAU), START BY READING THE LITERATURE ON APROBLEM; THE ROAD TO SCIENCE STARTS IN THE LIBRARY. THE UNIVERSITY COURSE ONSTUDENTS' EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH WORK INCULCATES THE READING HABIT, INDEPENDENTWORK WITH BOOKS. FOR BEST RESULTS STUDENTS SHOULD ABSTRACT THE IMPORTANT PARTSOF THEIR READING, THINKING IT OVER UNHURRIEDLY. CREATIVE INTERACTION WITH THETEXT IS MOST IMPORTANT. AFTER LECTURES, THE NEXT STAGE IS THE LIBRARY,FOLLOWING UP POINTS MADE IN THE LECTURES. TACTFUL LIBRARIANS HELP READERSCHOOSE A BOOK AT THEIR LEVEL OF COMPETENCE AND, IN A SHORT CONVERSATION, CANAROUSE STRONG INTEREST IN A BOOK OR, CONVERSELY, SWITCH A READER OVER TO ANALTERNATIVE CHOICE.
5116|THE FILMING OF COMPLETE MUSICAL STOCKS OF HISTORICAL IMPORTANCE IN SMALLERLIBRARIES NOT GENERALLY OPEN TO THE PUBLIC, CARRIED OUT BY THE GERMAN MUSICHISTORY ARCHIVE IN KASSEL.MUCH OF THE VALUABLE OLD MANUSCRIPT AND PRINTED MUSIC IN GERMANY IS NOT OWNEDBY THE STATE AND ONLY FOUND IN SMALL ARCHIVES IN CASTLES, MONASTERIES,CHURCHES AND SCHOOLS. WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF THE VOLKSWAGEN FOUNDATION, THEARCHIVE IS WORKING IN NORTH GERMANY, MICROFILMING THESE MUSICAL TREASURES,CATALOGUING THEM AND THEN MAKING THEM AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC. IMPORTANTCOLLECTIONS RECENTLY COVERED INCLUDE' MUSIC IN LUBECK PUBLIC LIBRARY FROM THE17|TH CENTURY NORTH GERMAN SCHOOL OF ORGAN MUSIC AND ITS 18|TH CENTURYSUCCESSORS; 18|TH CENTURY MUSIC BELONGING TO A NOBLE FAMILY IN EUTIN; 17|TH AND18|TH CENTURY MUSIC IN A SCHOOL IN JEVER. THESE COLLECTIONS HAVE BEENMICROFILMED AND ARE NOW BEING CATALOGUED.
5117|THE HANDICAPPED AND MUSIC: THE ROLE OF MUSIC LIBRARIES?.THE DISABLED LIVING FOUNDATION HAS WORKED CLOSELY WITH UK MUSIC LIBRARIES INRECENT YEARS TO PROVIDE AN ADVISORY SERVICE ON MUSIC FOR THE HANDICAPPED;DANISH MUSIC LIBRARIES ARE ALSO ACTIVE IN THIS SPHERE. THE 60| MUSIC LIBRARIESIN GERMANY HAVE SO FAR DONE LITTLE FOR THE HANDICAPPED; THEY SHOULD OBTAIN ALLAVAILABLE INFORMATION FROM THE UK AND DISCUSS WITH LIBRARIANSHIP ANDGOVERNMENT BODIES THE ADAPTATION OF THE UK SCHEME FOR GERMANY. THE GERMANLIBRARY INSTITUTE COULD ORGANISE A PILOT PROJECT FOR 1983|-84|. TOPICS TO BECONSIDERED INCLUDE THE PROVISION OF MUSIC IN HOSPITALS, DAY CENTRES ANDSCHOOLS, THE USE OF MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS BY THE HANDICAPPED, THE PRODUCTION OFBIBLIOGRAPHIES, THE IMPROVEMENT OF SPECIAL LIBRARY SERVICES AND EMPLOYMENTPOSSIBILITIES FOR THE HANDICAPPED IN THE MUSIC INDUSTRY.
5118|WHAT BOOKS DO PEOPLE NEED?.SINCE LIBRARIANS THEMSELVES ARE WELL EDUCATED, THERE IS ALWAYS A DANGER THATTHEY MAY CATER SOLELY FOR THE WISHES OF AN ELITE MINORITY AND, BY EXCLUDINGEPHEMERAL LITERATURE FROM STOCK, DISCOURAGE MANY OTHER PEOPLE FROM USING THELIBRARY. THE WEST GERMAN NATIONAL LIBRARY PLAN OF 1973| STATES CLEARLY THATLIBRARIES MUST CATER FOR EVERYONE, EVEN IF PROBLEMS ARE CAUSED BY LIMITEDBUDGETS. IT IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT EMPHEMERAL LITERATURE HAS A RELAXINGEFFECT ON MANY PEOPLE, IN CONTRAST TO THE STIMULATING EFFECT CAUSED BY MOREDEMANDING WORKS. A POSSIBLE SOLUTION WOULD BE TO EXCLUDE LESS VALUABLEMATERIAL, SUCH AS WORKS INVOLVING PORNOGRAPHY AND VIOLENCE AND THEN TO INCLUDESOME TRIVIA IF CAREFUL ANALYSIS OF READER STRUCTURE DEMANDS IT.
5119|HOW CAN YOUR SON BECOME A READER?.THE MOSCOW AND TUL'SK PAEDAGOGIC INSTITUTES RECENTLY INVESTIGATEDSCHOOLCHILDREN'S WANING INTEREST IN FICTION AND FOUND ELEMENTARYSCHOOLCHILDREN READ LITTLE AND WERE INDIFFERENT TO FICTION. THEEXTRA-CURRICULAR READING PROJECT FOR 1|ST TO 3|RD FORMS EVOLVED. HERE CHILDRENLEARN TO EXAMINE BOOKS CAREFULLY BEFORE DECIDING ON SELECTION. AFTER 6| MONTHSOF THIS INSTRUCTION, 65|% OF 1|ST-FORMERS WERE QUICKLY ABLE TO FIND THE BOOKSREQUIRED. THE METHOD IS SUPPLEMENTED BY READING ALOUD STORIES ABOUT THE TEXT,LITERARY GAMES, COMPETITIONS, ETC. THE AIM IS TO FAMILIARISE 1|ST TO3|RD-FORMERS WITH SOME OF THE BEST RUSSIAN, SOVIET AND FOREIGN LITERATURE.LIBRARIANS SHOULD CONSOLIDATE ON THESE EARLIEST SCHOOL READING HABITS. SCHOOLLIBRARY COORDINATION IS NECESSARY.
5120|POPULATION AND ITS STRUCTURAL COMPOSITION AS THE DETERMINING FACTOR FORLOCATION OF LIBRARIES AND THEIR WORK.A THOROUGH ANALYSIS OF THE 1980| POPULATION CENSUS AS TO CHANGES IN DENSITY,SEX, AGE, EMPLOYMENT AND NATIONALITY, MAINLY IN THE SLOVAK SOCIALIST REPUBLIC,OFFERING IT AS A BASIS FOR THE FUTURE PLANNING OF LIBRARIES.
5121|THE PLANNABLE AND UNPLANNABLE (1|)' LIBRARIES AS THE INFRASTRUCTURE OFPRESERVATION AND CHANGE.LECTURE GIVEN AT THE ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE GERMAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION ANDTHE ASSOCIATION OF LIBRARIANS IN NORTH RHINE-WESTPHALIA, OCT 80|. LIBRARYSERVICES MUST REACT AND DEVELOP IN RELATION TO SOCIAL CHANGE. THEY MUST CATERFOR THE NEEDS OF BOTH URBAN AND RURAL COMMUNITIES, WHERE TOWN AND COUNTRYPLANNING HAS SO OFTEN FAILED. WORKING HOURS ARE SHORTER NOW THAN IN THE PAST,SO LIBRARIES MUST DEVELOP FACILITIES FOR EDUCATIONAL AND RECREATIONAL READINGIN CONJUNCTION WITH THE MASS MEDIA. CHILDREN USE LIBRARIES MORE THAN ADULTSBUT THE BIRTH RATE HAS FALLEN AND THERE ARE MORE ELDERLY PEOPLE IN THECOMMUNITY TODAY THAN BEFORE; THIS, HOWEVER, IS NO EXCUSE FOR A DECLINE INLIBRARY STANDARDS. LIBRARIES MUST BECOME COMMUNICATION CENTRES, IN PARTICULARTO HELP THE MANY PEOPLE LIVING ALONE AND THE 4| MILLION FOREIGNERS IN WESTGERMANY.
5122|THE PLANNABLE AND UNPLANNABLE (II)' LIBRARIES AS THE INFRASTRUCTURE OFPRESERVATION AND CHANGE.LECTURE GIVEN AT THE ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE GERMAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION ANDTHE ASSOCIATION OF LIBRARIANS IN NORTH RHINE-WESTPHALIA, BIELEFELD, OCT 80|.(FOR PART 1|, 2|SEE1| PREVIOUS ABSTRACT). LIBRARIES EXIST TO FULFIL HUMAN NEEDSFOR EDUCATION, INFORMATION, COMMUNICATION AND GENERAL SELF-DEVELOPMENT. FUTURELIBRARY PLANNING MUST PAY MORE ATTENTION TO THE BALANCE OF STATIONARY ANDMOBILE ELEMENTS IN A SYSTEM, TO LOCAL NEEDS AND TO ADULT EDUCATION. BOTHQUALIFIED LIBRARIANS AND VOLUNTARY HELPERS CAN MAKE VALUABLE CONTRIBUTIONS TOLIBRARY SERVICES; STAFF OF HIGH CALIBRE ARE MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE MEDIATHEMSELVES OR ADVANCED TECHNICAL EQUIPMENT. TOO MUCH TECHNOLOGY IN A LIBRARYCAN ALIENATE THE READERS. IT IS DIFFICULT TO GENERALISE ABOUT MINIMUMSTANDARDS; EACH LIBRARY NEEDS ITS OWN IDENTITY.
5123|THE INNOVATION MOVEMENT IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES 1981|-85|.UNDER THE AEGIS OF THE EAST GERMAN MINISTRY OF CULTURE, DAS ZENTRALINSTITUTFUR BIBLIOTHEKSWESEN (CENTRAL INSTITUTE FOR LIBRARY SCIENCE) IS ORGANISING APROGRAMME ENCOURAGING LIBRARY STAFF TO DEVISE NEW TECHNICAL AIDS, WORKPROCESSES AND ECONOMIC MEASURES. EXPERIENCE HAS SHOWN THAT SUCH INNOVATIONSCAN BE APPLIED ON A SCALE MUCH WIDER THAN THAT OF THE ORIGINAL CONCEPT,DETERMINING FACTORS BEING THE CONDITIONS, STRUCTURE AND TECHNICAL LEVEL OFEACH LIBRARY. THE INNOVATION DOES NOT HAVE TO BE A NEW INVENTION BUT SHOULDRATHER BE A BETTER USE OF EXISTING MATERIAL OR IDEAS. THOSE TESTING THEINNOVATIONS MUST HAVE A GOOD KNOWLEDGE OF THEIR SUBJECT. MORE PARTICIPATIONMUST BE ENCOURAGED FROM THE YOUNG STAFF MEMBERS.
5124|A GLOOMY OUTLOOK FOR LIBRARIES?.PUBLIC LIBRARY DEVELOPMENT HAS HALTED AT A POINT WHEN, BECAUSE OF THERECESSION, LIBRARY SERVICES ARE PARTICULARLY NECESSARY. CURRENT ECONOMICMEASURES HAVE HIT LIBRARIES HARD. SOME PEOPLE NOW REGARD INFORMATION ASMERCHANDISE FOR WHICH A SUITABLE MARKET PRICE MUST BE OBTAINED; THIS INCREASESTHE RISK OF INFORMATION SERVICES BEING TAKEN OVER BY PRIVATE COMPANIES, WHICHCOULD LEAD TO REDUCTIONS IN STATE BUDGETS. THE RAPID DEVELOPMENT OFINFORMATION TECHNOLOGY THREATENS TO BYPASS THE LIBRARY SERVICE AND BECAUSE OFTHE COMPETITIVE SITUATION ON THE INFORMATION MARKET LIBRARIES ARE BEING ASKEDTO RESTRICT THEMSELVES TO THEIR TRADITIONAL TASKS. LIBRARIES MUST MOBILISERESERVES HITHERTO UNUSED; REFUSING TO IMPLEMENT NEW METHODS OF LITERATUREPROVISION COULD HAVE DISASTROUS CONSEQUENCES. INITIAL ORGANISATIONAL PROBLEMSCAN BE OVERCOME THROUGH RATIONALISATION, CENTRALISATION AND WIDER USE OFELECTRONIC DATA PROCESSING.
5125|THE LIBRARY UNION IN HAMBURG.IN 1978| A COOPERATIVE SCHEME WAS INAUGURATED BETWEEN THE COMBINED STATE ANDUNIVERSITY LIBRARY AND OVER 100| INSTITUTE AND DEPARTMENTAL LIBRARIES OF THECOLLEGES OF TECHNOLOGY TO PRODUCE A UNION CATALOGUE AND ORGANISE COOPERATIVEPURCHASING OF BOOKS AND PERIODICALS. THE SCHEME HAS ALSO BEEN JOINED BY THETECHNICAL UNIVERSITY AT HAMBURG-HARBURG AND WILL ULTIMATELY INCLUDE OTHERLIBRARIES IN NORTH GERMANY. WORK ON THE UNION CATALOGUE HAS BEGUN WITH THEUNIVERSITY'S PERIODICALS, FOR WHICH ELECTRONIC DATA PROCESSING IS USED.CHANGES IN THE DATA PROCESSING SYSTEM WILL SHORTLY BE MADE AND MORE WORK ISNEEDED ON HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE. MORE SPACE AND MONEY WILL BE NEEDED AS THESCHEME EXPANDS.
5126|A NATIONWIDE NETWORK: WHICH SCENARIO IS BEST?.AN EDITED VERSION OF THE PAPER A NATIONWIDE NETWORK' DEVELOPMENT, GOVERNANCE,SUPPORT. THE PAPER HAS BEEN PREPARED BY THE US LIBRARY OF CONGRESS NETWORKADVISORY COMMITTEE AND IS A WORKING DOCUMENT INVITING COMMENT AND DISCUSSIONTHROUGHOUT THE LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SERVICE. IT OFFERS 3| SCENARIOS FOR THECONSTRUCTION OF A NATIONWIDE LIBRARY AND INFORMATION NETWORK' (1|) ALEGISLATIVE MODEL DEPENDENT ON CONGRESS TO MANDATE THE NETWORK AND PRESCRIBEITS GOVERNING STRUCTURE; (2|) AN EVOLUTIONARY MODEL RESULTING FROM 2|AD HOC1|AGREEMENTS; AND (3|) A PRIVATE SECTOR MODEL DEVELOPING FROM THE NON-PROFIT ANDFOR-PROFIT PRIVATE SYSTEMS IN RESPONSE TO DEMAND FROM THE MARKET PLACE.
5127|REGIONAL COOPERATION' SOME PRACTICAL DEVELOPMENTS.PAPER PRESENTED TO A MEETING OF THE WORKING PARTY ON PROVINCIAL CENTRALLIBRARIES IN DEVENTER, 19| NOV 81|. IN THE NETHERLANDS THE CUTBACKS IN LOCALGOVERNMENT FINANCES TOGETHER WITH THE GROWING DEMAND ON LIBRARIES FORTECHNICAL INFORMATION HAVE ENCOURAGED PUBLIC LIBRARIES TO COOPERATE WITH ONEANOTHER ON A REGIONAL BASIS TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY AND EFFICIENCY OF THEIRSERVICES. IN ADDITION THE EXPECTATION THAT THE EXISTING NETWORK OF LIBRARIESCHARGED WITH A REGIONAL SUPPORT FUNCTION WILL BE INCREASED, AND THEDECENTRALISATION OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT SERVICES AS PROPOSED IN THE NEW PUBLICSERVICES ACT, WILL FURTHER ENCOURAGE THIS TREND. HOWEVER, WHERE LIBRARIESENTER INTO SCHEMES OF COOPERATION THE NEEDS OF THEIR READERS SHOULD REMAIN THEPRIME CONSIDERATION.
5128|WASHINGTON COUNTY COOPERATIVE LIBRARY SERVICES NETWORK.OREGON'S WASHINGTON COUNTY COOPERATIVE LIBRARY SERVICES NETWORK BEGAN AS ANINFORMAL BASIS IN 1974| WITH A UNION LIST OF SERIALS FOR INTERLIBRARYBORROWING. THIS PROMPTED FUNDING FOR A STUDY OF COOPERATION AMONG LIBRARIES INTHE COUNTY. A STUDY BY PHYLLIS I. DALTON SET GUIDELINES FOR GETTING ACOOPERATIVE EFFORT GOING AND A PILOT PROJECT WAS BEGUN. PROGRAMMES INITIATEDINCLUDED' BOOKS-BY-MAIL; COUNTYWIDE COURIER SERVICE; BACK-UP REFERENCESERVICE; STORE-FRONT COMMUNITY LIBRARIES; AND A ROTATING CASSETTE PROGRAMME.TODAY WCCLS OPERATES ON A COUNTYWIDE SERIAL LEVY AND AWAITS AUTOMATION ANDCABLE TV AS THE ULTIMATE ANSWER TO A FULL COOPERATIVE EFFORT.
5129|RELATIONS WITH THE PUBLIC.EXAMINES THE USE OF PUBLIC RELATIONS BY LIBRARIES ILLUSTRATED WITH MANY USEXAMPLES OF BOTH INSIDE AND OUTSIDE LIBRARIES.
5130|YEAR FURTHER DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMME OF LIBRARY SERVICES IN WHITE RUSSIA.THE MAIN TRENDS OF THIS PROGRAMME ARE CONCERNED WITH' THE DEVELOPMENT OF ALIBRARY SYSTEM-THE CENTRALISATION OF STATE LIBRARIES WAS COMPLETED IN THE 10|TH5|-YEAR PLAN, THAT OF TRADE UNION LIBRARIES IS IN THE PROCESS OF COMPLETION.THE NEXT 5| YEARS WILL SEE THE CENTRALISATION OF SPECIALISED LIBRARIES, WITHLIBRARIES OF ALL TYPES FORMING 1| SYSTEM; READER SERVICES, EDUCATION TOWARDSCOMMUNIST IDEALS BEING THE PRIORITY; ORGANISATION OF SERVICES TO THECOMMUNITY-THIS SHOULD BE CONCERNED WITH EVERY LOCALITY, EVERY TOWN BOROUGH;INFORMATION AND BIBLIOGRAPHIC SERVICES, PRIORITY BEING GIVEN TO PARTY,IDEOLOGICAL AND CULTURAL WORKERS; LIBRARY STOCKS; AND RESEARCH ANDMETHODOLOGICAL WORK.
5131|NATIS' A CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK FOR MALAYSIA.DISCUSSES THE UNESCO INITIATED CONCEPT OF THE NATIONAL INFORMATION SYSTEM(NATIS), AND DEVELOPS A CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF NATIS INMALAYSIA. REVIEWS THE STEPS INVOLVED IN THE FORMULATION OF A NATIONALINFORMATION POLICY, AND DESCRIBES THE PROPOSED ORGANISATIONAL STRUCTURE OF THEMALAYSIAN NATIONAL INFORMATION SYSTEM. THIS WOULD CONSIST OF' A NATIONALINFORMATION COUNCIL; A SECRETARIAT; AND SECTORAL COORDINATORS.
5132|NEW HORIZONS IN LIBRARY DEVELOPMENT IN THE RSFSR.SUMMING UP THE WORK OF LIBRARIANSHIP IN THE LAST 5|-YEAR PLAN, AND LOOKINGFORWARD TO THE NEXT, IT IS POSSIBLE TO DISCERN 6| MAIN AREAS OF LIBRARYACTIVITY' THE COMPLETION OF CENTRALISATION; THE FURTHER IMPROVEMENT OF LIBRARYNETWORKS; THE RATIONAL EXPLOITATION OF STOCKS; THE BETTER TRAINING OF LIBRARYSTAFF; IMPROVING THE MATERIAL AND TECHNOLOGICAL BASE OF LIBRARIES; ANDDEVELOPING WORK WITH READERS. IT IS NECESSARY TO SET SPECIFIC GOALS FOR THENEW 5|-YEAR PLAN AND TO DRAW ON PAST EXPERIENCE TO HELP ACHIEVE THEM.
5133|STATISTICS AS BASIS FOR IMPROVEMENT OF THE QUALITY AND EFFICIENCY OF LIBRARYPROCESSES.AN IN-DEPTH ANALYSIS OF THE WORKING OF A LIBRARY OR A LIBRARY SYSTEM CAN BECARRIED OUT BY MEANS OF STATISTICAL DATA OBTAINED FROM THE WHOLE SPECTRUM OFITS ACTIVITIES. THESE CAN BE DIVIDED INTO' ACTIVITIES OF ITS ORGANISATIONALAND MATERIAL BASIS; WORK CONCERNING USERS; WORK RELATED TO LOANS. THE QUALITYOF WORK CAN THEN BE DETERMINED BY MEANINGFUL CORRELATION OF INDIVIDUAL DATAWITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF 1| OF THESE GROUPS, OR BETWEEN THE DATA AND INDEXES OF2| OR 3| GROUPS.
5134|LAW CONCERNING THE UNIFIED SYSTEM OF SOCIO-ECONOMIC INFORMATION AND LIBRARYSTATISTICS.IN 1971| THE FEDERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE CZECHOSLOVAK SOCIALIST REPUBLIC DECREED BYLAW THE FORMATION OF A UNIFIED SYSTEM OF SOCIO-ECONOMIC INFORMATION. ITSPRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS ARE INVESTIGATED HERE, MAINLY IN REGARD TO LIBRARYSTATISTICS PROVIDED WITHIN THE SYSTEM. AN IN-DEPTH ANALYSIS OF THE CURRENTSTATE OF LIBRARY AND INFORMATION CENTRE STATISTICS WAS CARRIED OUT IN 1979|; ITSHOWED MANY SHORTCOMINGS CONCERNING STATISTICAL INDEXES AND THEIR DEFINITION.AS A RESULT A UNIFIED STATISTICAL SYSTEM WAS INTRODUCED WHICH IS HEREDISCUSSED IN DETAIL.
5135|NATIONAL RANKINGS AS A MEANS OF EVALUATING MEDICAL SCHOOL LIBRARY PROGRAMS' ACOMPARATIVE STUDY.PRESENTS THE RESULTS OF A COMPARATIVE STUDY UNDERTAKEN TO ASSESS THE REASONSFOR THE LOW RANKINGS RECEIVED BY THE GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY MEDICALCENTER LIBRARY IN THE PUBLICATION 2|ANNUAL STATISTICS FOR MEDICAL SCHOOLLIBRARIES IN THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA1|. CONCLUDES THAT THE 2|ANNUALSTATISTICS1| AND OTHER TRADITIONAL MEASURES OF QUALITY ARE INAPPROPRIATE ANDINACCURATE MEASURES FOR EVALUATING LIBRARY PROGRAMMES, SINCE THEY ONLY MEASURERESOURCE ALLOCATIONS AND NOT THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THESE ALLOCATIONS. SUGGESTSSOME ALTERNATIVE EVALUATION METHODS.
5136|DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS IN LIBRARIES.FOLLOWING A REVIEW OF THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF COMPUTERS AND MANAGERIALSCIENCE/OPERATIONS RESEARCH TO THE MANAGEMENT OF LIBRARIES, THIS PAPERINTRODUCES THE CONCEPT OF DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS. DSS, A BLENDING OF THESETECHNIQUES, CAN LEAD TO MORE EFFECTIVE DECISIONS BY LIBRARY MANAGERS. A CASESTUDY OF THE UTILISATION OF A DSS IN THE BUDGETING PROCESS OF A MEDIUM SIZEDLIBRARY ILLUSTRATES THE PROCESS. REPORT NOT AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
5137|METHODOLOGICAL CENTRES AND THE CONTROL THEY EXERCISE OVER PUBLIC LIBRARIES.THE MINISTRY OF CULTURE OF THE SLOVAK SOCIALIST REPUBLIC HAS ASSIGNED TOMETHODOLOGICAL CENTRES THE TASK OF PARTICIPATING IN THE MANAGEMENT OF PUBLICLIBRARIES IN ALL ITS ASPECTS. THIS IS DONE BY INSPECTION, ADVICE AND FINALLYSUGGESTION OF SOLUTIONS TO THE LIBRARY'S MANAGEMENT PERSONNEL. THE SCOPE OFTHEIR AUTHORITY IS, HOWEVER, NOT QUITE CLEAR. DELEGATION OF GREATERINDEPENDENCE OF DECISION TO METHODOLOGICAL WORKERS IS DESIRABLE. SOLUTIONSSUGGESTED FOR METHODOLOGICAL APPROACH TO DISTRICT AND SIMILAR LIBRARIES AREEXPRESSED BY MEANS OF FLOW-CHARTS.
5138|INFORMATION AND BIBLIOGRAPHICAL REFERENCE WORK AT A NEW LEVEL IN CENTRALISEDSYSTEMS.CENTRALISED LIBRARY SYSTEMS HAVE RESPONDED IN A VARIETY OF WAYS TO THE CALLFOR GREATER DEVELOPMENT OF INFORMATION WORK. EXAMPLES FROM ALL OVER THE USSRSHOW HOW THEY HAVE UNDERTAKEN MORE BOOK PROMOTION AND INFORMATIONDISSEMINATION; ORGANISED SURVEYS TO ASCERTAIN THE INFORMATION NEEDS IN THEIRAREA; PAID PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO THE NEEDS OF AGRICULTURAL WORKERS; ANDESTABLISHED IMPORTANT LINKS WITH THE SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL INFORMATIONCENTRES AT REPUBLICAN LEVEL. PUBLIC LIBRARIES, MINDFUL OF THEIR ROLE TO SERVETHE WHOLE COMMUNITY, ARE ALSO TURNING THEIR ATTENTION TO THE NEEDS OFPOLITICAL WORKERS, TEACHERS AND OTHERS OUTSIDE THE SPHERE OF MATERIALPRODUCTION.
5139|SOME ISSUES IN PLANNING THE WORK OF CENTRALISED LIBRARY SYSTEMS.PLANNING IN THE WORK OF CENTRALISED LIBRARY SYSTEMS CAN BE SEEN AS THE METHODBY WHICH THE MOST FAVOURABLE CIRCUMSTANCES ARE CREATED FOR THE SATISFACTION OFTHE DEMANDS OF THE LOCAL POPULATION FOR BOOKS AND FOR INFORMATION. PLANNINGPROCEDURES HAVE HAD TO CHANGE SIGNIFICANTLY AS LIBRARIES HAVE COMBINED INTOCENTRALISED SYSTEMS AND RECENT EXPERIENCES FROM LIBRARIES FROM ALL OVER THEUSSR CAN BE COMPARED. THE INTRODUCTION OF LONG-TERM PLANNING IN THIS RESPECTIS PARTICULARLY RELEVANT.
5140|YOU TOO CAN BE A LIBRARY PLANNER-PART I.PART 1| OF A 2|-PART INTRODUCTION TO THE AMERICAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION MANUAL APLANNING PROCESS FOR PUBLIC LIBRARIES.

THEGOVERNMENT INTENTION TO DEMOCRATISE SCIENCE BY EDUCATION AND POPULARISATION ISGENERALLY APPROVED, BUT CRITICISM IS MADE OF THE PROPOSED IMPLEMENTATIONPROCEDURES. IN EMPHASISING THE NECESSITY OF LOCAL DECISION-MAKING IN THECREATION OF INFORMATION NETWORKS, THE IMPORTANCE OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND AGLOBAL ORIENTATION IS BEING IGNORED.
5207|INFORMATION SCIENCE AND ITS SIGNIFICANCE FOR SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH ACTIVITIES.ONE OF THE WAYS OF INCREASING THE CONTRIBUTION OF SCIENTIFIC INFORMATIONSERVICES TO SCIENTIFIC CREATIVE WORK IS THROUGH THEIR IDENTIFICATION WITH THELOGICAL, PSYCHOLOGICAL, SOCIAL AND ORGANISATIONAL NEEDS OF THE RESEARCHPROCESS. COOPERATION ITSELF BETWEEN RESEARCH AND INFORMATION WORKERS CAN BEGINEVEN BEFORE THERE IS A SPECIFIC RESEARCH TASK; SOME INSTITUTIONS HAVEEXPERIMENTED WITH THE POLICY THAT EACH NEW RESEARCHER HAS TO SPEND A MONTH OR2| IN THE INFORMATION DEPARTMENT. THE COOPERATION GOES THROUGH SEVERAL STAGES,FROM THE PRELIMINARY SEARCH TO AVOID DUPLICATION IN RESEARCH TO THE CLOSERCOLLABORATION OF BOTH PARTNERS' TEAMS. SOMETIMES THE COLLABORATION IS SO CLOSETHAT AN INFORMATION SCIENTIST BECOMES A CO-AUTHOR.
5208|DISSEMINATION OF THE PUBLISHED RESULTS OF AN IMPORTANT CLINICAL TRIAL' ANANALYSIS OF THE CITING LITERATURE.PRESENTS THE RESULTS OF A CITATION ANALYSIS STUDY OF AN IMPORTANT CLINICALTRIAL WHICH DEMONSTRATED THE BENEFICIAL EFFECTS OF A TECHNIQUE FOR TREATINGDIABETICS. THE STUDY WAS CARRIED OUT TO DETERMINE WHY THIS TECHNIQUE WAS STILLNOT WELL KNOWN 18| MONTHS AFTER ITS PUBLICATION. CONCLUDES THAT A LARGE NUMBEROF CITATIONS IN THE LITERATURE TO A CLINICALLY SIGNIFICANT PAPER DO NOT OFITSELF ENSURE THAT THE INFORMATION REPORTED WILL READILY REACH THE APPROPRIATEPRACTICING PHYSICIAN. STRESSES THE NEED FOR MORE EFFECTIVE METHODS FOR THERAPID DISSEMINATION OF IMPORTANT NEW FINDINGS TO THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY.

IT IS CLEAR THAT, THROUGHUNIFIED AS WELL AS DIFFERENTIAL COMPETENCE RELATIONSHIPS OF THE INFORMATIONSERVICES INVOLVED, THROUGH WORK SHARING, SPECIALISATION AND COOPERATION, ANIMPROVEMENT IN PERFORMANCE, QUALITY AND RELATED EFFECTIVITY CAN BE ACHIEVED INTHE PRESENTATION AND PROCESSING OF INFORMATION.
5215|INFORMATION AND MANAGEMENT.DEMONSTRATES HOW RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN INFORMATION MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUES CANBE USED IN ADMINISTRATION. THE IMPORTANCE OF INFORMATION IN DECISION MAKING ISDISCUSSED WITH REFERENCE TO THE MANAGER'S RESPONSIBILITY FOR COORDINATINGACCESS TO INFORMATION RESOURCES AND ENSURING THAT EXPLOITATION IS COSTEFFECTIVE. PROPOSES A PRACTICAL MODEL FOR ORGANISING AN INTEGRATED INFORMATIONSERVICE, SUFFICIENTLY FLEXIBLE TO DRAW ON ALL AVAILABLE EXISTING INFORMATIONNETWORKS IN AN ORGANISATION, THROUGH A COMMON CODIFICATION. THEN DISCUSSESCODIFICATION OPERATIONS, EMPHASISING THE IMPORTANCE OF STANDARDISATION HERE IFTHE INFORMATION SYSTEM IS TO FUNCTION SUCCESSFULLY.
5216|LIBRARIANS AND INFORMATION MANAGEMENT IN PRIVATE ENTERPRISE AND GOVERNMENTAGENCIES.DISCUSSES HOW THE LIBRARIAN CAN SERVE THE INFORMATION NEEDS OF A SPECIALISEDTYPE OF ORGANISATION AND CONSIDERS HOW INFORMATION IS USED IN GOVERNMENT ANDPRIVATE ENTERPRISE, ITS IMPORTANCE AS A RESOURCE, AND WHAT INFORMATIONMANAGEMENT INVOLVES. THE LIBRARIAN ACCORDINGLY MUST ADAPT HIS SKILLS TO THEDEMANDS OF THE PARTICULAR ENVIRONMENT, WHERE INVOLVEMENT IN INFORMATIONMANAGEMENT AND THE ORGANISATION'S OPERATIONS REQUIRES ACTIVE PARTICIPATION INPLANNING ACTIVITIES AND OPERATIONS SUPPORT. SUGGESTS HOW SIMILAR ORGANISATIONSCOULD SHARE INFORMATION RESOURCES THROUGH NETWORK COOPERATION, AND ILLUSTRATESTHE LIBRARIAN'S ROLE IN SUPPORTING ORGANISATION OPERATIONS. FINALLY EMPHASISESTHE IMPORTANCE OF ADAPTING TRAINING PROGRAMMES TO RECOGNISE THE KIND OFDEMANDS THE LIBRARIAN WILL MEET IN THIS CONTEXT.

5228|ADMINISTRATIVE CONSTRAINTS AS A HINDRANCE TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF DOCUMENTATIONSERVICES.DISCUSSES WHY DOCUMENTATION SERVICES AT PRESENT ARE MEETING ADMINISTRATIVEOPPOSITION TO EXPANSION AND DEVELOPMENT, AND SOME POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS, WITHREFERENCE TO CLASSICAL ORGANISATION THEORY. EXAMINES THE ENVIRONMENTAL ANDECONOMIC OBSTACLES TO ACCESSIBILITY OF INFORMATION AND DEVELOPMENT OFSERVICES, AND PROPOSES THAT ORGANISATION PERFORMANCE BE RATED ACCORDING TO ITSUSE, NOT ITS OBJECTIVES. IF THIS IS ACCEPTED, THE INCREASED USE OF INFORMATIONNETWORKS WOULD PROVIDE A POSSIBLE SOLUTION TO CURRENT PROBLEMS, BUT CERTAINLYGREATER EMPHASIS ON MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUES IS ESSENTIAL IN TRAINING INFORMATIONPROFESSIONALS.
5229|BAKER'S STRATEGY FLOUNDERS.A CRITICAL ANALYSIS OF THE PROGRESS MADE BY THE UK'S MINISTER FOR INFORMATIONTECHNOLOGY KENNETH BAKER DURING HIS 1|ST YEAR OF OFFICE, INCLUDING INFORMATIONTECHNOLOGY YEAR. LOOKS PARTICULARLY AT PLANS FOR EDUCATION AND TRAINING ANDLIST PROJECTS OF 1981|. WITHOUT THE POLITICAL MUSCLE OF A FULL MINISTRY WITHITS OWN BUDGET AND INFLUENCE IN THE CABINET, EVERYTHING BAKER TRIES TO DO WILLINEVITABLY BE TACTICAL RATHER THAN STRATEGIC, AND RESPONSIVE RATHER THAN TRULYINITIATING.
5230|USER EDUCATION-FOR LIFE?.USER EDUCATION PROGRAMMES FALL INTO 2| CATEGORIES. THEY MAY AIM SIMPLY TO HELPTHE STUDENT THROUGH HIS COURSE AND FAMILIARISE HIM WITH A SINGLE LIBRARY(SHORT-TERM OBJECTIVES), OR TO PROVIDE A FULLER AWARENESS OF THE GENERATION,ROLE, AND USE OF INFORMATION WHICH MAY ALLOW HIM TO RESEARCH PROBLEMS IN ANYSUBSEQUENT PROFESSIONAL SITUATION (LONG-TERM OBJECTIVES).

5234|INFORMATION AND DOCUMENTATION' AN UNDERDEVELOPED AREA IN THE WORLD OFEDUCATION.CREATIVE ACTIVITIES ARE CURRENTLY FASHIONABLE; IN INFORMATION ANDDOCUMENTATION THEY HAVE PRODUCED A VAST QUANTITY OF LITERATURE, MOST OF WHICHMUST ULTIMATELY BE DISCARDED FOR FINANCIAL REASONS. NEVERTHELESS THESEACTIVITIES ARE NECESSARY BECAUSE EACH STUDENT AND RESEARCHER SHOULD OFFER HISIDEAS TO HIS COLLEAGUES FOR EXAMINATION; SCIENTIFIC PROBLEMS TOUCH ON SEVERALDISCIPLINES AND SO REQUIRE MULTILATERAL PLANNING; AND NEGLECTING TO STUDYCURRENT INTERNATIONAL LITERATURE CAN PROVE COSTLY OR CAN RESULT IN VAGUE,UTOPIAN PROJECTS. YOUNG SCIENTISTS AND ENGINEERS MUST DEVOTE TIME TOLITERATURE STUDY; TRAINING AT UNIVERSITY LEVEL AND IN THE FACTORY OR RESEARCHCENTRE IS NEEDED. OFFICIAL DOCUMENTATION CENTRES MUST BE USER-ORIENTED.
5235|INTRODUCTION OF STANDARDS TO BIBLIOGRAPHICAL PRACTICE.REVIEWS THE WORK OF THE KNIZHNAYA PALATA USSR (THE UKRAINIAN BOOK CHAMBER) INTHE FIELD OF STANDARDISATION. THE APPLICATION OF STANDARDS TO BIBLIOGRAPHICALWORK AND PUBLISHING WAS 1| OF THE MAIN TOPICS OF THE CHAMBER'S RESEARCHPROGRAMME IN THE PERIOD 1976|-80|.

ON THEREPUBLICAN LEVEL THE CHAMBER IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE APPLICATION OF STANDARDSIN UKRAINIAN PUBLISHING.
5236|THE ACQUISITION OF AND BIBLIOGRAPHIC ACCESS TO INFORMATION-A TASK FORLIBRARIES?.LIBRARIES SHOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ACQUIRING 2|INFORMATIONSMITTEL1| AS DEFINEDBY GEORG SCHMOLL SUPPLYING A SUMMARISED FORM OF INFORMATION SOURCES ANDPRESENTING IT TO THE USER IN A PRACTICAL FORM. AT PRESENT THIS TYPE OFMATERIAL (BIBLIOGRAPHICAL MATERIAL, INCLUDING LIBRARY CATALOGUES) IS NOTCOLLECTED BY LIBRARIES IN SUFFICIENT QUANTITIES AS IT IS OFTEN NOT AVAILABLETHROUGH NORMAL MARKET SOURCES VIA PUBLISHERS. AS INFORMATION MATERIAL ISGENERALLY IN A PROCESSED FORM, LIBRARIES DO NOT ALWAYS CLASSIFY THE CONTENTSFURTHER. HOWEVER, THE FORM IN WHICH THE MATERIAL IS MADE AVAILABLE TO THE USERIS VERY IMPORTANT AS IT SHOULD BE POSSIBLE TO MAKE INDEPENDENT USE OF THEINFORMATION. OFTEN THE MATERIAL IS CLASSIFIED TO BE USED BY PARTICULAR USERGROUPS, FIRMS, LIBRARY COLLECTIVES OR SECTORS OF THE INFORMATION ANDDOCUMENTATION SYSTEM. LIBRARIES MUST TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION WHICH USER GROUPSNEED WHICH INFORMATION MATERIAL IN THEIR AREA AND ALSO WORK WITH OTHERLIBRARIES TO PROVIDE A LARGER SELECTION OF NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONALINFORMATION MATERIAL.
5237|PROBLEMS OF IMPROVING BIBLIOGRAPHICAL WORK IN THE USSR.BIBLIOGRAPHICAL WORK IN THE USSR IS REVIEWED IN THE LIGHT OF THE DECISIONS OFTHE CENTRAL COMMITTEE OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY IN 2|ON FURTHER IMPROVEMENT OFIDEOLOGICAL AND POLITICAL EDUCATION1|. MAIN ACHIEVEMENTS OF SEVERAL LIBRARIESAND INFORMATION CENTRES IN THE ADVANCEMENT OF BIBLIOGRAPHICAL WORK INCLUDETHOSE IN THE NATIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHY, CENTRALISED CATALOGUING AND BIBLIOGRAPHICSERVICES TO SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY. THOSE ASPECTS OF BIBLIOGRAPHICAL WORK NOTDEVELOPED TO A SATISFACTORY LEVEL ARE' CHILDREN'S BIBLIOGRAPHY, PLANNING ANDCOORDINATION OF BIBLIOGRAPHICAL WORK AND THE USE OF RESOURCES. AN IMPORTANTROLE WILL BE PLAYED BY AUTOMATION IN THE IMPROVEMENT OF BIBLIOGRAPHICALPROCESSES.

THE DEGREE OF ACCESSIBILITY TO TREATY INFORMATION IS MUCHGREATER THAN BEFORE' TREATY INFORMATION IS NO LONGER THE PRESERVE OFGOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, THANKS TO PUBLICATIONS LIKE THE UNITED NATIONS TREATYSERIES. THERE IS STILL A NEED, HOWEVER, FOR A BIBLIOGRAPHY OF CURRENTLYPUBLISHED TREATY COLLECTIONS AND TREATIES IN FORCE. THE MANY PROBLEMS STILLFACED IN GAINING ACCESS TO TREATY INFORMATION CAN ONLY BE SOLVED BYINTERNATIONAL COOPERATION AND BETTER SUPPORT FOR THE UNITED NATIONS TREATYSECTION.
5241|RECOMMENDED BIBLIOGRAPHY' AN IMPORTANT AID TO COMMUNIST EDUCATION.MAJOR FUNCTIONS OF RECOMMENDED BIBLIOGRAPHY ARE' TO ASSIST IN THE ORGANISATIONOF READING WITH REGARD TO EDUCATION AND DEVELOPMENT OF PERSONALITY; AND TOASSIST IN THE PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT OF PERSONNEL AND SPECIALISTS. A WELLDEVELOPED THEORY OF RECOMMENDED BIBLIOGRAPHY IS BROUGHT INTO PRACTICE THROUGHTHE UNIFIED SYSTEM OF RECOMMENDED BIBLIOGRAPHIES. THE LEADING ROLE IS HELD, INTHE SYSTEM, BY THE GOSUDARSTVENNAYA BIBLIOTEKA IM. V.I. LENINA (LENIN STATELIBRARY) WHOSE WORK REPRESENTS THE CURRENT STANDARD OF RECOMMENDEDBIBLIOGRAPHY IN THE COUNTRY. AS THE CENTRE OF BIBLIOGRAPHICAL WORK AT THENATIONAL LEVEL, THE LIBRARY IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE FORECASTING, PLANNING ANDDESIGN OF BIBLIOGRAPHICAL WORK IN LIBRARIES AND FOR THE PROVISION OFMETHODOLOGICAL GUIDANCE IN THIS FIELD.
5242|WHY ENGINEERS DON'T USE DATABASES.SHORTENED VERSION OF AN ARTICLE IN 2|MECHANICAL ENGINEERING1| MAR 81|. CLAIMSTHAT US ENGINEERS LARGELY IGNORE COMPUTERISED DATA BANKS AND USE DATED ANDLIMITED INFORMATION SOURCES. THEY COLLECT MOST OF THEIR ADVANCED TECHNICALINFORMATION THROUGH DISCUSSIONS WITH VENDORS, SALESMEN, CONSULTANTS, AND THEIRPEERS AND RESTRICT THEIR FORMAL READING TO THE MATERIAL IN THE VICINITY OFTHEIR DESKS. THE CULPRIT IS THE INDEXING' THE MAJOR INDEXING SYSTEMS INDEX BYSUBJECT OR THE NAME OF AN OBJECT, BUT AN ENGINEER WISHES TO RETRIEVEINFORMATION INDEXED BY FUNCTION. ALSO, VITAL PRODUCT INFORMATION IS NOTAVAILABLE ON A CREDITABLE DATA BASE.
5243|THE USE OF SECONDARY INFORMATION SOURCES FOR PATENT INFORMATION.THE EXPANSION OF INDUSTRIALLY ORIENTED PATENT INFORMATION SERVICES MEANS THATINFORMATION ON PATENTS MUST BE QUALITATIVELY AND QUANTITATIVELY IMPROVED,WHICH PRESUPPOSES THE USE OF RATIONAL PROCEDURES FOR OBTAINING PATENTDESCRIPTIONS. WITH EXAMPLES TAKEN FROM PATENT DESCRIPTIONS FROM EAST AND WESTGERMANY, THE ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF SUBJECT DOCUMENTATION THROUGH THEUSE OF PRIMARY SOURCES OR ABSTRACTS ARE PRESENTED. GENERALLY THE BEST RESULTSARE ACHIEVED WHEN CONTENT ANALYSIS IS BASED ON AN ABSTRACT OR SUMMARY; PRIMARYSOURCES ARE OFTEN OF EXCELLENT QUALITY, ESPECIALLY THOSE FROM EAST GERMANY,BUT THEIR USE CAN BE EXPENSIVE AND TIME-CONSUMING.

5299|LAW OF LEGAL DEPOSIT RELATING TO 'LIBRARY MATERIALS' IN THE LIGHT OF THE NEWMEDIA ACT.THE AUSTRIAN LAW OF LEGAL DEPOSIT WAS DUE FOR REFORM, PARTLY TO BRING UP TODATE THE PRICE LIMITS FOR BOOKS DEPOSITED, AND PARTLY TO EXTEND THE SCOPE TOINCLUDE MULTI-MEDIA CATEGORIES. THE NEW ACT, WHICH CAME INTO FORCE IN JUNE 81|,IS CRITICISED FOR ITS EXCLUSION OF NON-BOOK MATERIALS (ESPECIALLY FILMS) INSPITE OF THE FACT THAT THE AUSTRIAN NATIONAL LIBRARY HAS A LEGAL OBLIGATION,SINCE JULY 81|, TO MAINTAIN MULTI-MEDIA ARCHIVES. THERE IS ALSO CRITICISM OFTHE INCLUSION OF PARLIAMENT AS A DEPOSIT LIBRARY, OF THE EXTENDED CATEGORIESOF EXEMPTION AND OF THE DECISION TO ALLOW PUBLISHERS 1| MONTH IN WHICH TODEPOSIT INSTEAD OF 8| DAYS AS PREVIOUSLY.
5300|DORMANT EXCHANGES SUPPORTED BY A SYSTEM OF TOKENS; A SUGGESTION.THE TERM 'DORMANT EXCHANGE' DESCRIBES AN EXCHANGE SYSTEM IN WHICH 1| LIBRARYNEEDS AND OBTAINS AN ITEM AT A GIVEN TIME FROM ANOTHER LIBRARY BUT NOT VICEVERSA. AN EXCHANGE IS STILL MADE, HOWEVER, BUT ON A CREDIT SYSTEM SO THAT THEOTHER LIBRARY CAN REQUEST DESIRED MATERIAL AT A LATER DATE WHEN THE NEEDARISES, THUS ELIMINATING WASTEFUL EXCHANGES. THE OPERATION COULD BE GREATLYSIMPLIFIED BY THE INTRODUCTION OF AN INTERNATIONALLY VALID EXCHANGE TOKENENABLING A RECIPIENT LIBRARY TO PAY FOR EXCHANGE MATERIAL AND A PROVIDINGLIBRARY TO RECEIVE CREDIT FOR WHAT IS SUPPLIED.

5303|THE NEED FOR IMPROVED WORLDWIDE PROVISION OF PUBLICATIONS.NATIONAL AVAILABILITY OF PUBLICATIONS MUST BE SUPPLEMENTED BY INTERNATIONALAVAILABILITY. THE BEST EVIDENCE FOR THE NEED FOR BETTER INTERNATIONALPROVISION IS SUPPLIED BY DATA ON INTERNATIONAL LENDING. THE VOLUME OFINTERNATIONAL LENDING AND PHOTOCOPYING IS ABOUT 1| MILLION ITEMS A YEAR AND ISGROWING RAPIDLY. SATISFACTION RATES AND SUPPLY TIMES BOTH NEED IMPROVEMENT.ABOUT 2|/3| OF DEMAND IS FOR JOURNALS, AND IS CONCENTRATED ON A SMALL NUMBER OFCENTRES, WHICH GIVE A MUCH BETTER THAN AVERAGE SERVICE. SPEED OF SUPPLYAPPEARS TO BE UNRELATED TO DISTANCE. POSSIBLE PATTERNS OF PROVISION FOR THEFUTURE INCLUDE ACCESS TO IMPROVED COLLECTIONS OF NATIONAL IMPRINTS, REGIONALSYSTEMS, AND LARGE NATIONAL DOCUMENT SUPPLY CENTRES IN COUNTRIES WITH HEAVYINTERLENDING DEMAND.

TOTAL ESTIMATES FOR DAMAGEDMATERIAL IN THE EARLY 1960|S WERE OVER 422|,000| DM, A SUM WHICH AT THAT TIMECOULD NOT BE MET. THE FLOODS OF 1962| IN HAMBURG CAUSED PARTICULAR PROBLEMS.SINCE 1978| EXTRA FINANCIAL HELP HAS COME FROM THE VOLKSWAGEN FOUNDATION. THEWORK IS NOT ONLY EXPENSIVE BUT ALSO EXCEPTIONALLY TIME-CONSUMING. THE WORKSHOPIS INVOLVED IN EXHIBITIONS, TRAINING COURSES FOR LIBRARY STUDENTS AND NATIONALAND INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCES; A COLLECTION OF SUBJECT LITERATURE HAS ALSOBEEN DEVELOPED.

THESE HAVE LED TO MANY WOULD-BE THEFTSBEING PREVENTED AND CHARGES BEING BROUGHT FOR THEFT. HOWEVER, THE MAJORITY OFTHESE CHARGES HAVE HAD TO BE DROPPED OWING TO LOOPHOLES IN LAWS APPLICABLE TOBOOK THEFTS. GERMAN CRIMINAL LAW STIPULATES THAT THE INTENTION OF KEEPING ANOBJECT MUST BE PRESENT TO CONSTITUTE A THEFT; THIS IS USUALLY IMPOSSIBLE TOPROVE IN THE CASE OF BOOK THEFTS. UNIVERSITY ADMINISTRATIVE LAW ALSO FAILS TOPROVIDE ADEQUATE PENALTIES AND VARIES FROM ONE STATE TO THE NEXT.

DISCUSSES CHANGES IN THE CATALOGUING OFPERIODICALS INTRODUCED BY AACR2| IN 3| GROUPS' THOSE THAT MAY BE CONSIDEREDIMPROVEMENTS OVER THE AACR1| AND ALA PRACTICES; THOSE OF A CONTROVERSIALNATURE; AND THOSE THAT ARE PRIMARILY COSMETIC. THE CHANGES ARE SEEN TO BEGENERALLY BENEFICIAL, LEADING TO GREATER CONSISTENCY IN CATALOGUE RECORDS FORPERIODICALS.
5357|RAK (RULES FOR ALPHABETICAL CATALOGUING) DISCUSSED.THE AUTHORISED EDITION OF RAK WAS PUBLISHED IN BERLIN IN 1976| AND IN WIESBADENIN 1977|. THIS COMPLETED ALPHABETICAL CATALOGUING REFORM IN GERMANY. FROM1976|-79| MUCH LITERATURE DEALING WITH RAK WAS PUBLISHED. MANY OF THEPUBLICATIONS WERE CONCERNED WITH ADAPTATIONS OF RAK TO SPECIFIC TYPES OFLIBRARIES SUCH AS RAK-WB (WISSENSCHAFTLICHE BIBLIOTHEKEN) ACADEMIC LIBRARIESOR RAK-OB (OFFENTLICHE BIBLIOTHEKEN) PUBLIC LIBRARIES. THIS WAS ALSO THE CASEIN EAST GERMANY WHERE ADAPTATIONS OF RAK FOR PUBLIC LIBRARIES, RESEARCHLIBRARIES AND UNION LIBRARIES WERE PUBLISHED. LITERATURE IS AVAILABLEEXPLAINING IN DETAIL THE USE OF RAK IN CERTAIN SUBJECT AREAS SUCH AS LAW,BIBLICAL LITERATURE, ARCHIVE LITERATURE, JOURNALS, NEWSPAPERS AND CONGRESSREPORTS. REPORTS AND DISCUSSIONS ON EXPERIENCES OF LIBRARIES IN THEINTRODUCTION OF RAK AND THE BEST METHODS OF TRAINING STAFF MOSTLY STEM FROMEAST GERMANY AND ARE ONLY FIRST INITIATIVES IN THIS FIELD.
5358|THE TITLE PAGE OF A RECORD.THE NEW RAK (RULES FOR ALPHABETICAL CATALOGUING) SECTION ON THE CATALOGUING OFMUSICAL SCORES AND SOUND RECORDINGS HAS BEEN AVAILABLE IN PRE-PRINT FORM SINCETHE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR. PRACTICAL TESTING OF AND DISCUSSION ON THE SECTIONARE ESSENTIAL TO REVEAL ANY GAPS OR AMBIGUITIES SO THAT THESE MAY BEELIMINATED. THE QUESTION OF WHAT CONSTITUTES A TITLE PAGE WHERE A RECORD ISCONCERNED MUST BE CONSIDERED. ACCORDING TO THE NEW RULES, THE LABEL ON THE 1|STSIDE OF A RECORD OR RECORD SET SHOULD BE TREATED AS THE TITLE PAGE; IF THEREIS INSUFFICIENT INFORMATION HERE THE RECORD COVER SHOULD BE USED INSTEAD.EXAMPLES ILLUSTRATE PROBLEMS AND POSSIBLE DISCREPANCIES BETWEEN LABELS ANDCOVERS.

5360|THE WEST GERMAN NATIONAL SERIAL DATA SYSTEM.THE WEST GERMAN NATIONAL SERIALS DATA BASE IS BEING JOINTLY DEVELOPED BY THEDEUTSCHES BIBLIOTHEKSINSTITUT AND THE STATE LIBRARY IN WEST BERLIN. ITCURRENTLY COVERS 260|,000| TITLES-800|,000| HOLDINGS IN 1|,000| WEST GERMANLIBRARIES.
5361|NATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS IN SERIALS.PAPER PRESENTED AT THE CANADIAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION'S CANADIAN ASSOCIATION OFCOLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES TECHNICAL SERVICES COORDINATING GROUPWORKSHOP, VANCOUVER, B.C., 14| JUNE 80|. IN THE EARLY 1970|S 2| NATIONAL TASKGROUPS RECOMMENDED THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A NATIONAL SERIALS DATA BASE INCANADA. TO CREATE A DATA BASE LIBRARIES MUST SHARE DATA ABOUT SERIALS.STANDARDS ARE A PRE-REQUISITE TO SHARING DATA-A STANDARD DEFINITION OF ASERIAL, THE ISSN, THE MARC FORMAT, STANDARDS FOR HOLDINGS STATEMENTS ANDLIBRARY SYMBOLS AND CATALOGUING STANDARDS. USE OF STANDARD SOURCES OF DATAALSO FACILITATES SHARING. A NATIONAL SERIALS DATA BASE NOW EXISTS IN CANADA ONTHE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DOBIS SYSTEM JOINTLY MAINTAINED BY THE NATIONAL LIBRARYOF CANADA AND THE CANADA INSTITUTE OF SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL INFORMATION.DATA ON HOLDINGS OF MAJOR CANADIAN LIBRARIES ARE COLLECTED AND EDITED IN ACENTRAL LOCATION.
5362|BCUC AND SERIALS..PAPER PRESENTED AT THE CANADIAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION'S CANADIAN ASSOCIATION OFCOLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES TECHNICAL SERVICES COORDINATING GROUPWORKSHOP, VANCOUVER, B.C., 14| JUNE 80|. PRESENTS A SHORT HISTORY OF THEDEVELOPMENT OF THE BRITISH COLUMBIA UNION CATALOGUE PROJECT'S SERIALS TASKGROUP DEC 77|-JUNE 80|. OUTLINES OBSTACLES TO COOPERATION IN THE CREATION OF APROVINCIAL UNION CATALOGUE OF SERIALS AND PRESENTS SOME POSSIBLE METHODS OFOVERCOMING THESE OBSTACLES.
5363|ANSI Z39|.42| AND OCLC' OCLC'S IMPLEMENTATION OF THE AMERICAN NATIONAL STANDARDINSTITUTE'S SERIAL HOLDINGS STATEMENTS AT THE SUMMARY LEVEL.DESCRIBES THE ADOPTION OF THE AMERICAN NATIONAL STANDARD INSTITUTE'S STANDARD,FOR DESCRIBING SERIALS HOLDINGS AT THE SUMMARY LEVEL, BY ONLINE COMPUTERLIBRARY CENTER (OCLC). THIS FORMS PART OF OCLC'S POTENTIAL TO BECOME ANATIONWIDE UNION CATALOGUE OF PERIODICALS.
5364|THE ANSI STANDARD FOR SUMMARY HOLDINGS STATEMENTS FOR SERIALS' THE RLINIMPLEMENTATION.DESCRIBES THE APPLICATION OF THE AMERICAN NATIONAL STANDARD INSTITUTE'SSTANDARD FOR SERIAL HOLDINGS STATEMENTS (ANSI Z39|.42|) TO RLIN (RESEARCHLIBRARIES INFORMATION NETWORK).
5365|THE NATIONAL SERIALS DATA SYSTEM IN THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY.TRACES THE DEVELOPMENT OF REGIONAL COMPUTERISED UNION CATALOGUES OFPERIODICALS IN WEST GERMANY. THE TREND TOWARDS THE DEVELOPMENT OF A NATIONALUNION CATALOGUE, THE NATIONAL SERIALS DATA SYSTEM, WHEREBY THE REGIONALSYSTEMS ARE CONNECTED TO A NATIONAL DATA BASE IN WEST BERLIN IS DESCRIBED.
5366|AN ON-LINE REGIONAL UNION CATALOG OF MONOGRAPHS AND AUDIOVISUALS' ADEMONSTRATION PROJECT.THE PROJECT'S OBJECTIVE IS TO CREATE AN ON-LINE REGIONAL UNION CATALOGUE OFMONOGRAPHS AND AUDIOVISUAL MATERIALS USING EXISTING MACHINE READABLE RECORDSOF PARTICIPATING LIBRARIES CREATED IN A VARIETY OF SYSTEMS. THE RESULTANT FILEWILL BE SEARCHABLE BY AUTHOR, TITLE, SUBJECT AND KEYWORD, AND WILL FACILITATERESOURCE-SHARING BY EXPEDITING THE PROVISION OF MONOGRAPHS AND AUDIOVISUALMATERIALS WITHIN A 6|-STATE REGION OF THE USA; IT WILL FURTHER PROVIDE VALUABLESTATISTICAL INFORMATION FOR COORDINATING COLLECTION DEVELOPMENT. 1| IMPORTANTASPECT IS THE EXPEDITING OF INTERLIBRARY LOAN REQUESTS, BY AUTOMATICGENERATION AND THE STORAGE IN MASSAGE FILES FOR THE HOLDING LIBRARY, WITHOUTTHE REKEYBOARDING OF DATA.
5367|A WONDERFUL TOY.THE DANISH TECHNICAL LIBRARY AT THE DANISH TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY SET UP A DATABASE IN 1968| CONTAINING LOCATIONS OF THE LIBRARY'S OWN HOLDINGS. AT THE END OFTHE 70|S THIS FACILITY WAS EXPANDED TO AN ON-LINE SYSTEM OF LOCATING ALSO OTHERLIBRARIES' ACQUISITIONS AND CONNECTED TO SCANNET AND EURONET. DESCRIBES A NEWDEVELOPMENT OF THE SYSTEM, CALLED ALIS (AUTOMATED LIBRARY INFORMATION SYSTEM),INITIATED IN NOV 81|. IT IS NOW POSSIBLE TO REQUISITION TITLES THROUGH THE ALISCATALOGUES. THESE TITLES WILL BE THOSE READILY AVAILABLE, AS THE LIBRARY'SLOANS WILL BE REGISTERED IN THE TERMINAL FROM 1982|. USE OF ALIS IS FREE. THESYSTEM, DESCRIBED DIAGRAMMATICALLY, CONSISTS OF A LOCAL SYSTEM FORADMINISTRATION OF LOANS, AND THE I/S DATACENTRALEN'S FREE TEXT STANDARD SEARCHSYSTEM.
5368|SOME CURRENT ISSUES IN PLANNING FOR LIBRARY AUTOMATION AT THE STATE LEVEL.THE CONNECTICUT AUTOMATION COORDINATING COMMITTEE (CACC) WAS FORMED IN 1980| TOPROVIDE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL GROUPS, LIBRARIES AND ORGANISATIONS ENGAGED INOR INTERESTED IN DEVELOPING AUTOMATED SYSTEMS TO MEET REGULARLY TO SHAREINFORMATION AND TO BEGIN AN INFORMAL PLANNING EFFORT. DISCUSSES MAJOR ISSUESTHAT THE CACC HAS FACED WHICH HAVE IMPLICATIONS FOR OTHER STATES. A STATEWIDEON-LINE UNION CATALOGUE IS LIKELY TO CONSIST OF COMPONENTS DEVELOPEDINDEPENDENTLY BY INDIVIDUAL LIBRARIES OR GROUPS OF LIBRARIES WHICH HAVEVOLUNTARILY ADOPTED GUIDELINES AND STANDARDS SUGGESTED BY THE CACC. THE ROLEOF THE CACC IS THE IDENTIFICATION OF EXISTING AND EMERGING CATALOGUES WHICHMIGHT BECOME COMPONENTS, THE PROMOTION OF ADEQUATE ACCESS TO THOSE COMPONENTSAND THE ASSURANCE THAT THERE IS A REASONABLE PROSPECT OF EVENTUAL LINKAGE ANDINTEGRATION OF THOSE COMPONENTS.
5369|A LONG FAREWELL TO 'NARROW' CATCHWORDS.THE USE OF 'NARROW' CATCHWORDS AS A PRINCIPLE ELEMENT IN CATCHWORD CATALOGUESIS NO LONGER ACCEPTABLE. THE TERM 'NARROW' IS TOO VAGUE AND DOES NOT CONVEYTHE CONTENT AND MEANING WHICH IT SHOULD. THE PRINCIPLE OF THE 'NARROW'CATCHWORD HAS ALWAYS BEEN REGARDED AS DEFINING A CLASSIFICATION METHOD; THISIS HOWEVER, NOT THE CASE. LIBRARIES WOULD BE ADVISED TO CONFORM WITH STANDARDTERMINOLOGY USED IN DOCUMENTATION AND INFORMATION SCIENCE AND TO AVOID FURTHERUSE OF THE 'NARROW' CATCHWORD OR 'NARROW' TERM. THE CONTROL OF CLASSIFICATIONTERMINOLOGY IS A VERY IMPORTANT AREA OF LIBRARY SCIENCE WHICH SHOULD BE MORECLEARLY DEFINED. EXAMINING SUCH TERMS AS THE PRINCIPLE OF THE 'NARROW'CATCHWORD IS, THEREFORE, 1| STEP TOWARDS ELIMINATING TERMINOLOGY WHICH HAS NOREAL MEANING OR USE.
5370|A MODEL FOR A WEIGHTED RETRIEVAL SYSTEM.RECENT ARTICLES HAVE ANALYSED RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS WITH CONTINUOUS WEIGHTS OFVARIOUS TYPES AND/OR WITH A BOOLEAN STRUCTURE FOR THE QUERIES. THEY HAVE ALSOSUGGESTED CRITERIA WHICH SUCH SYSTEMS OUGHT TO SATISFY AND RECORD EVALUATIONMECHANISMS WHICH PARTIALLY SATISFY THESE CRITERIA. OFFERS A MORE CAREFULANALYSIS, BASED ON A GENERALISATION OF THE DISCRETE WEIGHTS. ALSO LOOKS AT THEWEIGHTS FROM AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT APPROACH INVOLVING THRESHOLDS, ANDGENERATES AN IMPROVED EVALUATION MECHANISM WHICH SEEMS TO FULFIL A LARGERSUBSET OF THE DESIRED CRITERIA THAN PREVIOUS MECHANISMS. THIS NEW MECHANISMALLOWS THE USER TO ATTACH A 'THRESHOLD' TO THE QUERY TERM.
5371|A COMPARISON OF TWO SYSTEMS OF WEIGHTED BOOLEAN RETRIEVAL.A MAJOR DEFICIENCY OF TRADITIONAL BOOLEAN SYSTEMS IS THEIR INABILITY TOREPRESENT THE VARYING DEGREES TO WHICH A DOCUMENT MAY BE WRITTEN ON A SUBJECT.IN THIS ARTICLE A NUMBER OF CRITERIA THAT SHOULD BE MET BY ANY BOOLEAN SYSTEMGENERALISED TO HAVE A WEIGHTING CAPABILITY ARE ISOLATED. IT IS PROVEN THATONLY 1| WEIGHTING RULE SATISFIES THESE CONDITIONS; THAT ASSOCIATED WITHFUZZY-SET THEORY; AND THAT THIS WEIGHTING SCHEME SATISFIES MOST OF THE OTHERPROPERTIES ASSOCIATED WITH BOOLEAN ALGEBRA AS WELL. PROBABILISTIC WEIGHTING ISTHEN INTRODUCED AS AN ALTERNATIVE APPROACH AND THE 2| SYSTEMS COMPARED. IN THELIMIT OF ZERO/1| WEIGHTS, ALL SYSTEMS CONSIDERED CONVERGE TO TRADITIONALBOOLEAN RETRIEVAL.
5372|THE LONGER THE NUMBER, THE SMALLER THE SPINE' OR, UP AND DOWN WITH MELVIL ANDELSIE.DISCUSSES THE PARADOX OF TRADITIONAL LIBRARY CLASSIFICATION' THE AIM OFEXPRESSING ON SUBJECT IN DETAIL IS IN CONFLICT WITH THE AIM OF PROVIDING ANINEXPENSIVE AND USEFUL DEVICE BY WHICH BOOKS CAN BE SHELVED AND RETRIEVED.SUGGESTS THE USE OF 2| DIFFERENT SCHEMES (OR 2| LEVELS OF THE SAME SCHEME). THE1|ST SCHEME WOULD PROVIDE CLASSIFICATION NUMBERS OF REASONABLE LENGTHS TOARRANGE ITEMS IN BROAD SUBJECT GROUPS WHILST THE 2|ND SCHEME (OR VARIANT OF THE1|ST) WOULD PROVIDE LONGER NUMBERS FOR DETAILED SUBJECT ACCESS ANDCOMPREHENSIVE BROWSING CAPABILITY IN ON-LINE SYSTEMS. THESE SCHEMES COULD BEAPPLIED TO ALL TYPES OF LIBRARY MATERIALS.
5373|CLASSIFICATION AND SUBJECT INDICATION' HIGHLIGHTS OF THE ANGLO-AMERICANDEBATE, 1850|-1950|.DISCUSSES THE DEVELOPMENT OF UK AND US IDEAS ON SUBJECT HEADINGS ANDCLASSIFICATION FROM THE TIME OF PANIZZI'S CHALLENGE TO CLASSIFIED CATALOGUINGTHROUGH THE PRACTICAL APPROACH OF CUTTER AND HULME TO THE WORK OF BLISS.CUTTER AND HULME NEVER FULLY DEVELOPED THEIR PRACTICAL APPROACH, LEAVING THEWAY CLEAR FOR THE THEORETICAL CLASSIFICATIONISTS SUCH AS OTLET AND RICHARDSON.UNIVERSAL DECIMAL CLASSIFICATION WAS THE MANIFESTATION OF THEIR PRINCIPLES ANDALSO THE BEGINNING OF A DECISIVE HISTORICAL MOVEMENT THAT CULMINATES IN THEWORK OF BLISS. HIS GREAT VALUE IS THAT HE OFFERS AN INDEPENDENT PERSPECTIVE ONTHE HISTORY OF CLASSIFICATION AND SUBJECT INDICATION AND IS REASONABLYENCOURAGING ABOUT COLON CLASSIFICATION, THE SYSTEM THAT ENDED THE FORMATIVECLASSIFICATIONIST PERIOD IN ANGLO-AMERICAN THOUGHT.
5374|CONFERENCE ON THE APPLICATION OF THE SOVIET LIBRARY-BIBLIOGRAPHICALCLASSIFICATION BY RESEARCH LIBRARIES IN THE GDR.A CONFERENCE WAS HELD AT THE GREIFSWALD UNIVERSITY LIBRARY ON 20| NOV 80| ON THEAPPLICATION OF THE SOVIET LIBRARY BIBLIOGRAPHICAL CLASSIFICATION (BBK) SYSTEMBY RESEARCH LIBRARIES IN EAST GERMANY. THE PURPOSE OF THE CONFERENCE WAS TOBRING TOGETHER MEMBERS OF RESEARCH LIBRARIES WHICH HAD INTRODUCED BBK TODISCUSS THEIR EXPERIENCES IN THE APPLICATION OF THE SYSTEM. AS THE GREIFSWALDUNIVERSITY LIBRARY HAD THE MOST EXPERIENCE IN THIS FIELD (19| YEARS) THEY TOOKTHE INITIATIVE IN CONVENING THE CONFERENCE. MEMBERS OF DIFFERENT LIBRARIESGAVE TALKS ON VARIOUS ASPECTS AND PROBLEMS OF INTRODUCING BBK. ALL THEADVANTAGES OF BBK SHOULD BE USED WHEN ADAPTING IT TO AN EXISTINGCLASSIFICATION SYSTEM AND THE MINIMUM NUMBER OF CHANGES MADE. SOME OF THEPROBLEMS DISCUSSED WERE' ADAPTATIONS NECESSARY IN SUBJECTS SUCH AS SOCIALSCIENCES, MARXISM-LENINISM, BIOPHYSICS, BIOCHEMISTRY AND MOLECULAR  BIOLOGY;THE PROBLEMS OF THE FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OF BBK AND EXPERIENCES INRECLASSIFYING A SYSTEMATIC CATALOGUE ACCORDING TO THE BBK SYSTEM.
5375|LIVING WITH DDC 19|; NOT LIVING WITH DDC 19|.PRESENTS REACTIONS OF 2| LIBRARIANS TO RECLASSIFYING THEIR LIBRARIES ACCORDINGTO THE 19|TH EDITION OF THE DEWEY DECIMAL CLASSIFICATION. ELIZABETH DICKINSONDESCRIBES HOW STOCKTON PUBLIC LIBRARY (CALIFORNIA) BEGAN THE PROCESS OFADAPTATION ALMOST AS SOON AS THE NEW EDITION WAS PUBLISHED AND OUTLINES THEWORKING PRINCIPLES, PUBLIC IMPACT AND CRITIQUES AND RESPONSES WITH LESSONSTHAT HAVE BEEN LEARNED. FOR JOSEPHINE RINE AT MINNEAPOLIS COMMUNITY COLLEGE(MINNESOTA), WITH ONLY A SMALL STAFF, RECLASSIFICATION IS AN IMPOSSIBLE DREAM.
5376|THE COLON IN UDC.IN UDC A LARGE NUMBER OF SYMBOLS ARE USED TO FORM THE COMPLEX NOTATION. MOSTOF THESE SYMBOLS HAVE SEVERAL POSSIBLE MEANINGS WHICH CAUSE PROBLEMS,ESPECIALLY IN THE CASE OF THE COLON, WHEN UDC IS USED IN AN AUTOMATEDINFORMATION SYSTEM. THE COLON IS CLEARLY INTENDED AS A SIGN DENOTING ARELATIONSHIP NEEDING NO FURTHER DEFINITION BETWEEN 2| NUMBERS. THE USE OF THECOLON WITH MORE THAN 2| UDC NUMBERS, ALTHOUGH UNOFFICIAL, HAS BECOMEWIDESPREAD; THE RANGE OF PERMITTED PERMUTATIONS IS DESCRIBED. WHERE THE COLONMAY BE USED BETWEEN 2| NUMBERS, THE POSSIBLE REVERSIBILITY OF THE RELATIONSHIPMAY BE TAKEN FOR GRANTED. IF THE POSSIBILITY OF PERMUTATION IS REMOVED THENTHE COLON RESUMES ITS ORIGINAL FUNCTION OF DENOTING A HIERARCHIC RELATIONSHIPBETWEEN 2| OR MORE UDC NUMBERS.
5377|MACRO- AND MICROTHESAURI' CHANGES OCCURRING IN MESH-DERIVED THESAURI AND ASOLUTION TO SOME RELATED SEARCH HANDICAPS.EXPLORES CHANGES THAT CAN OCCUR DURING THE CREATION OF A DERIVATIVE THESAURUS.A TERM TRANSLATION DICTIONARY IS PROPOSED TO AID MESH-TRAINED AND OTHERSEARCHERS WHO WOULD BE USING THE CANCER INFORMATION THESAURUS.
5378|QUANTITATIVE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN DESCRIPTORS AND NON-DESCRIPTORS IN THESAURI.ABOUT 40| THESAURI OR COLLECTIONS OF SUBJECT TERMINOLOGY EQUIVALENT TO THESAURIWERE STUDIED WITH REGARD TO QUANTITY RATIOS BETWEEN DESCRIPTORS ANDNON-DESCRIPTORS OR BETWEEN DESCRIPTORS AND A TOTAL VOCABULARY. WITH THE HELPOF REGRESSION ANALYSIS, LINEAR CONNECTIONS WERE MADE WITH A STRONGLYEMPHASISED CORRELATION BETWEEN THE NUMBER OF DESCRIPTORS AND THENON-DESCRIPTORS. THEN THE NUMBER OF NON-DESCRIPTORS WAS FOUND TO INCREASE MORESLOWLY THAN THAT OF THE DESCRIPTORS, DEMONSTRATING THAT THE PROPORTION OFNON-DESCRIPTORS TO THE TOTAL VOCABULARY DECREASES AS THE NUMBER OF DESCRIPTORSINCREASES. THE INIS THESAURUS (INTERNATIONAL NUCLEAR INFORMATION SYSTEM) ISDESCRIBED IN RELATION TO THIS THEORY AND FOUND TO BE WELL PRODUCED.
5379|PROCEEDINGS OF THE CONFERENCE UNIVERSITIES IN WORLD NETWORK OF INFORMATION ANDCOMMUNICATION III HELD IN DUBROVNIK, MAY 20|-23|, 1980|).SPECIAL ISSUE DEVOTED TO THE 3|RD UNIVERSITIES IN THE WORLD NETWORK OFINFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION INCLUDING A COMMEMORATION OF PROFESSOR BOZOTEZAK, A SUMMARY OF THE PANEL DISCUSSION ON EDUCATION AND TRAINING ININFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION AND THE FOLLOWING SELECTION OF PAPERS'INFORMATION AND PRODUCTIVITY BY ROBERT M. HAYES; A 'LINC' BETWEEN UNIVERSITYLIBRARY, INFORMATION AND COMPUTING SERVICES USING VOICE INPUT/OUTPUT BY JOHNHAWGOOD; INFORMATION MEASUREMENT SYSTEMS BY S. PROHOROV; ISSUES IN DISTRIBUTEDDATA BASE DESIGN BY ABDULLAH UZ TANSEL; AND INTERNATIONAL STANDARDISATION OFMODULAR UNIVERSITY PROGRAMMES BY GUSTAV THURO. CONCLUDES WITH THE JOINTSTATEMENT OF CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS.
5380|HISTORICAL FILM DOCUMENTATION AT THE NETHERLANDS INFORMATION SERVICE.THE COMPUTERISED FILM DOCUMENTATION SYSTEM BEING DEVELOPED FOR USE IN THE FILMARCHIVE OF THE RIJKIVOORLICHTINGSDIENST (RVD), THE NETHERLANDS INFORMATIONSERVICE, IS DESCRIBED. DISCUSSES THE HISTORY OF THE FILM COLLECTION AND THEDIFFICULTIES OF PROVIDING ACCESS TO THE VAST AMOUNTS OF IMPORTANT FILM. IBMSTAIRS WAS FOUND TO MEET THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE NEW SYSTEM, ALTHOUGH SOMEASPECTS, SUCH AS ALPHABETISATION AND REGISTER CONSTRUCTION, WERE TAKEN FROMTHE LITERATURE INFORMATION SYSTEM (LISA) DEVELOPED IN THE NETHERLANDS, AND THEOUTPUT FORMATS ARE BASED ON THE ISBD (NBM) FOR NON-BOOK MATERIALS AS FAR ASPOSSIBLE.
5381|USING MODERN LIBRARY AND BIBLIOGRAPHICAL CLASSIFICATION SCHEMES IN SPECIALISEDCOMPUTER-BASED INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS.THERE ARE 3| DIFFERENT APPROACHES TO THE USE OF INDEXING LANGUAGES BASED ONCLASSIFICATION SCHEMES FOR SEARCHING COMPUTER FILES FOR SUBJECT REQUESTS. THEMECHANICAL APPROACH SIMPLY EXTENDS THE PRINCIPLE OF THE CARD CATALOGUE; THECOORDINATED APPROACH USES AS A SEARCH FORMAT A LIST OF CLASSIFICATION FEATURESEACH SERVING A HEURISTIC FUNCTION; THE INTEGRAL APPROACH PROVIDES A SYNTHESISOF CLASSIFICATION AND WORD LANGUAGES WITHOUT THE DRAWBACKS OF THE OTHER 2|, ANDOFFERS THE MOST LONG-TERM POSSIBILITIES. DETAILED EXAMPLES SHOW THE OPERATIONOF EACH APPROACH.
5382|A TRANSLATING COMPUTER INTERFACE FOR END-USER OPERATION OF HETEROGENEOUSRETRIEVAL SYSTEMS. 1|. DESIGN.ON-LINE RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS MAY BE DIFFICULT TO USE, ESPECIALLY BY END USERS,BECAUSE OF HETEROGENEITY AND COMPLEXITY. INVESTIGATIONS HAVE CONCERNED THECONCEPT OF A TRANSLATING COMPUTER INTERFACE AS A MEANS TO SIMPLIFY ACCESS TO,AND OPERATION OF, HETEROGENEOUS BIBLIOGRAPHIC RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS AND DATABASES. THE INTERFACE ALLOWS USERS TO MAKE REQUESTS IN A COMMON LANGUAGE. THESEREQUESTS ARE TRANSLATED BY THE INTERFACE INTO THE APPROPRIATE COMMANDS FORWHATEVER SYSTEM IS BEING INTERROGATED. SYSTEM RESPONSES MAY ALSO BETRANSFORMED BY THE INTERFACE INTO A COMMON FORM BEFORE BEING GIVEN TO THEUSERS. THUS, THE NETWORK OF DIFFERENT SYSTEMS IS MADE TO LOOK LIKE A SINGLE'VIRTUAL' SYSTEM TO THE USER. THE INTERFACE ALSO PROVIDES INSTRUCTION ANDOTHER SEARCH AIDS FOR THE USER. PHILOSOPHY, DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF ANEXPERIMENTAL INTERFACE NAMED CONIT ARE DESCRIBED.
5383|A TRANSLATING COMPUTER INTERFACE FOR END-USER OPERATION OF HETEROGENEOUSRETRIEVAL SYSTEMS. 2|. EVALUATIONS.THE EVALUATION OF THE CONCEPT OF A TRANSLATING COMPUTER INTERFACE FORSIMPLIFYING OPERATION OF MULTIPLE, HETEROGENEOUS ON-LINE BIBLIOGRAPHICRETRIEVAL SYSTEMS HAS BEEN UNDERTAKEN. AN EXPERIMENTAL RETRIEVAL SYSTEM, NAMEDCONIT, WAS BUILT AND TESTED UNDER CONTROLLED CONDITIONS WITH INEXPERIENCED ENDUSERS. A DETAILED ANALYSIS OF THE EXPERIMENTAL USAGES SHOWED THAT USERS WEREABLE TO MASTER INTERFACE OPERATION SUFFICIENTLY WELL TO FIND RELEVANT DOCUMENTREFERENCES. SUCCESS WAS ATTRIBUTED, IN PART, TO A SIMPLE COMMAND LANGUAGE,ADEQUATE ON-LINE INSTRUCTION, AND A SIMPLIFIED NATURAL LANGUAGE, KEYWORD/STEMAPPROACH TO SEARCHING. IT IS CONCLUDED THAT OPERATIONAL INTERFACES OF THE TYPESTUDIED CAN PROVIDE FOR INCREASED USABILITY OF EXISTING SYSTEMS IN A COSTEFFECTIVE MANNER, ESPECIALLY FOR INEXPERIENCED END USERS WHO CANNOT EASILYAVAIL THEMSELVES OF EXPERT INTERMEDIARY SEARCHERS. FURTHERMO RE, MORE ADVANCEDINTERFACES BASED ON IMPROVED INSTRUCTION AND AUTOMATED SEARCH STRATEGYTECHNIQUES COULD FURTHER ENHANCE RETRIEVAL EFFECTIVENESS FOR A WIDE CLASS OFUSERS. FOR PART 1|, 2|SEE1| PRECEDING ABSTRACT.
5384|PUBLIC LIBRARY GROUP WEEKEND SCHOOL, 3|RD TO 6|TH APRIL: MAN, MACHINES ANDMANAGEMENT.SUMMARIES OF PAPERS PRESENTED AT THE WEEKEND SCHOOL, WHICH WERE AS FOLLOWS:BLAISE: A GREEN PAPER, BY DAVID MARTIN; THE TEXTUAL REVOLUTION, BY ANTHONYSMITH; TELETEXT AND VIEWDATA, BY JIM BRUCE; HOW TO USE AN 'ON-LINE' REFERENCELIBRARY' AN EXAMINATION OF THE KINDS OF INFORMATION AVAILABLE FROM LOCKHEEDDIALOG, BY BRIAN COLLINGE; MANPOWER, MACHINES AND MANAGEMENT, BY JOHN ADAIR;AND WORD PROCESSING AND HANDLING, BY T. MORGAN.
5385|THE ON-LINE INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SERVICE AT METROPOLITAN BRADFORD LIBRARIES'ITS ESTABLISHMENT AND OPERATION, DECEMBER 1979|-SEPTEMBER 1981|.DESCRIBES THE ESTABLISHMENT AND EXPERIENCE OF THE ON-LINE INFORMATION SERVICEOPERATED BY METROPOLITAN BRADFORD LIBRARIES (UK) AS PART OF THE BRITISHLIBRARY FUNDED PROJECT SI/G/353|. THE TERMINAL WAS MAINLY USED TO CONDUCTSEARCHES IN RESPONSE TO ENQUIRIES FROM THE PUBLIC AND FROM MEDICAL PERSONNELWITHIN THE HEALTH DISTRICT, ALTHOUGH SOME STOCK REVISION AND BIBLIOGRAPHICALCHECKS WERE DONE.
5386|A STATE TRANSITION ANALYSIS OF ONLINE INFORMATION-SEEKING BEHAVIOR.STATISTICAL ANALYSES OF ON-LINE SEARCHING PATTERNS COMPARED THE USAGE OF AQUERY LANGUAGE BY VARIOUS GROUPS OF SEARCHERS. DATA WERE GATHERED BY ANEXPERIMENTAL PROJECT, INDIVIDUALIZED INSTRUCTION FOR DATA ACCESS (IIDA),CONCERNED WITH DEVELOPING AND TESTING A SYSTEM WHICH SERVES AS A TEACHER ANDASSISTANT TO USERS OF LOCKHEED'S DIALOG SYSTEM. SEQUENTIAL LISTINGS OF USERCOMMANDS WERE CLASSIFIED BY CORRESPONDING STATE CODES TO REPRESENT PHASES OFSEARCHING. ZERO- THROUGH 4|TH-ORDER MARKOVIAN ANALYSES OF INDIVIDUAL COMMANDSAND STRINGS OF LIKE COMMANDS WERE PERFORMED TO COMPARE SEARCHING PROCEDURESUSED BY 3| CLASSES OF USERS.
5387|THE IMPACT OF PRESTEL ON PUBLIC LIBRARY REFERENCE ACTIVITIES.DESCRIBES A PROJECT AIMED TO ASSESS THE IMPACT OF PRESTEL ON PUBLIC LIBRARYREFERENCE SERVICES FROM THE VIEWPOINT OF USERS AND LIBRARY STAFF, AS WELL ASCONSIDERING THE MANAGEMENT IMPLICATIONS SUCH AS STOCK ACQUISITION, BUDGET ANDSPACE USE. PRESTEL AND TELETEXT RECEIVERS WERE INSTALLED FOR 12| MONTHS INREFERENCE LIBRARIES IN THE LONDON BOROUGHS OF BEXLEY, HOUNSLOW, SUTTON ANDWALTHAM FOREST AND IN BIRMINGHAM AND NORWICH CENTRAL REFERENCE LIBRARIES.PRESTEL WAS FOUND TO BE A USEFUL SUPPLEMENT TO EXISTING RESOURCES FORSTATISTICAL, BUSINESS, NEWS AND LEISURE INFORMATION BUT THE STUDY INDICATEDFACTORS INHIBITING USE WHICH PRECLUDED MORE EXPERIMENTAL USE AND A MORETHOROUGH TESTING OF THEIR APPLICATION IN REFERENCE LIBRARIES.
5388|LOCAL COMMUNITY INFORMATION ON PRESTEL' USE OF THE BIRMINGHAM LOCALINFORMATION FILE.A BRITISH LIBRARY FUNDED MONITORING STUDY OF A LOCAL COMMUNITY INFORMATIONFILE ON PRESTEL, COVERING THE BIRMINGHAM AREA (UK). DATA WERE COLLECTED BYQUESTIONNAIRES SENT TO RESIDENTIAL USERS AND BY COLLECTING USE STATISTICS FROMTHE PRESTEL COMPUTERS. COVERS' FILE COMPOSITION AND DESIGN; COMPARATIVE USE OFDIFFERENT PARTS OF THE FILE; TOPIC PREFERENCE AMONG USERS; AND VOLUME OF USE.
5389|SHEDDING LIGHT ON TELETEXT.DISCUSSES THE USE OF TELETEXT IN THE UK AND PRESENTS THE FINDINGS OF A RECENTSURVEY OF TELETEXT USERS CARRIED OUT BY CIT (COMMUNICATIONS AND INFORMATIONTECHNOLOGY) RESEARCH (2|TELETEXT AND PRESTEL' USER REACTIONS1|). TELETEXTAPPEARS TO BE USED AS AN ADDITIONAL RATHER THAN ALTERNATIVE DATA SOURCE; ISACCESSED AN AVERAGE OF 1|-4| TIMES DAILY BY EACH USER; AND IS MOST OFTEN USEDFOR NEWS, WEATHER, TRAVEL, AND SPORT. 93|% OF USERS ARE SATISFIED, ALTHOUGH 29|%DESCRIBE IT AS INCOMPLETE. WARNS THAT CURRENT USERS ARE HIGHLY INNOVATIVE INTHEIR APPROACH AND MAY NOT BE TYPICAL OF FUTURE USERS. CONCLUDES THAT ADEFINITE CONSUMER MARKET EXISTS FOR TELETEXT.
5390|MACHINE-READABLE OUTPUT FROM ONLINE SEARCHES.MACHINE-READABLE OUTPUT (MRO) FROM ON-LINE SEARCHES IS USEFUL IN THECOMPILATION OF LARGE BIBLIOGRAPHIES. ARRANGEMENTS WERE MADE WITH A MAJORON-LINE RETRIEVAL VENDOR TO OBTAIN (FOR A FEE) OUTPUT IN THE FORM OF MAGNETICTAPE, RATHER THAN CONVENTIONAL OFF-LINE PRINTS ON PAPER. A PROGRAMME WASWRITTEN TO TRANSFORM AND PROCESS THE DATA; PART OF THIS PROGRAMME IS SIMILARTO A COMPUTER COMPILER. A METHOD OF CHECKING FOR DUPLICATE ITEMS WASDEVELOPED. MRO IS COST-EFFECTIVE AND ELIMINATES THE TIME-CONSUMING ANDLABOUR-INTENSIVE DATA ENTRY PROCESS. IT IS A NATURAL EXTENSION OF THE POWERSOF ON-LINE RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS.
5391|SWITCHING ON THE ELECTRONIC LIBRARY.BRIEFLY DISCUSSES THE COST OF USING 'ELECTRONIC LIBRARIES' (DATA BASES) ANDEXPLAINS WHY IT IS WORTH THE EXPENSE IN 3| AREAS-PATENTS, MEDICAL AND CHEMICALINFORMATION, AND THE LAW. REFERS TO THE PROBLEM OF CHOOSING APPROPRIATE TERMSIN A DATA BASE SEARCH AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF USER-FRIENDLY ALMOST-FOOLPROOFCOMPUTER SYSTEMS. CONCLUDES THAT, DESPITE THE DIFFICULTIES, THESE ELECTRONICLIBRARIES ARE STILL MUCH MORE CONVENIENT THAN SYSTEMS SUCH AS PRESTEL.
5392|ELECTRONIC PUBLISHING-SIZE, SHAPE, DILEMMAS OF ONLINE PUBLISHING.A BRIEF DISCUSSION ON THE PUBLISHING OF ON-LINE DATA BASES. CONSIDERS THEPRODUCTION AND PRICING OF PRINT AND MACHINE-READABLE FORMATS AS WELL AS THECHALLENGE OF FULL-TEXT ON-LINE SERVICES. AS THE GENERAL PUBLIC IS BECOMINGINFORMATION CONSCIOUS MORE DATA BASES OF POTENTIAL INTEREST TO THEM ARE BEINGDEVELOPED.
5393|LACK OF STANDARDIZATION OF THE JOURNAL TITLE DATA ELEMENT IN DATABASES.THE PROBLEM OF DATA ELEMENT REPRESENTATION IS MORE EXTENSIVE THAN MOSTPERCEIVE. THE NUMBER OF STANDARDS (INTERNAL, NATIONAL, AND INTERNATIONAL) ISLARGE, BUT THE USE OF STANDARDS IN DATA BASES IS NOT WIDESPREAD. THE RESULT ISA SIGNIFICANT LACK OF STANDARDISATION BOTH WITHIN AND ACROSS DATA BASES. THERESULT BECOMES APPARENT WHEN ONE ATTEMPTS AN EXHAUSTIVE SEARCH ON A PARTICULARDATA ELEMENT IN MULTIPLE DATA BASES. THE JOURNAL TITLE ELEMENT WAS STUDIED IN8| DATA BASES, AND 4| MEASURES WERE DEVELOPED TO SHOW THE EXTENT OFSTANDARDISATION WITHIN A DATA BASE AND SOME OF ITS IMPLICATIONS FOR SEARCHING.
5394|ADVANTAGES OF ON-LINE LITERATURE RESEARCH AND THE EXISTING AVAILABLE DATABASES.OBVIOUS ADVANTAGES OF ON-LINE LITERATURE RESEARCH COMPARED TO TRADITIONALMETHODS SUCH AS LIBRARY SUBJECT CATALOGUES ARE' THE RESEARCH RESULTS ARECOMPLETE; THE INFORMATION RETRIEVAL IS PRECISE DUE TO THE POSSIBILITY OFAND/OR COMBINATIONS; TIME IS SAVED AND THE RESEARCH RESULTS ARE AUTOMATICALLYPRINTED IN A HARDCOPY FORM INSTEAD OF HAVING TO BE PHOTOCOPIED OR HANDWRITTEN.IN WEST GERMANY, 75|% OF COMPUTER STORED LITERATURE REFERENCES I.E. 70| MILLIONDOCUMENT UNITS ARE AVAILABLE THROUGH NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL DATA BASES. 3|OF THE MOST IMPORTANT DATA BASES IN WEST GERMANY ARE DIMDI (DEUTSCHES INSTITUTFUR MEDIZINISCHE DOKUMENTATION UND INFORMATION, INKA (INFORMATIONSSYSTEMKARLSRUHE) AND GID (GESELLSCHAFT FUR INFORMATION UND DOKUMENTATION). THELARGEST INTERNATIONAL DATA BASES ARE LOCKHEED, THE EUROPEAN SPACE AGENCY (ESA)AND THE BRITISH LIBRARY AUTOMATED INFORMATION SERVICE (BLAISE).

PRESENTS A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF THE STRUCTURE AND SERVICES OFTHE INIS (INTERNATIONAL NUCLEAR INFORMATION SYSTEM) DATA BASE. THE MAINFEATURES AND OPERATION OF INTERACTIVE SEARCHING ARE DESCRIBED WITH ANINTRODUCTION TO THE STAIRS SYSTEM USED FOR SEARCHING THE DATA BASE. GIVES ANEXAMPLE OF AN ON-LINE SESSION.
5396|MEDLINE ON DIALOG' A GUIDE TO SEARCHING TECHNIQUES.DIALOG'S SOFTWARE IMPLEMENTATION OF MEDLINE CONTAINS SEVERAL SPECIAL FEATURES.MAJOR DIFFERENCES REGARDING DEFAULTS, DATA FORMS, WEIGHTING, SUBHEADINGS,CHECK TAGS, AND CASCADED DESCRIPTOR CODES ARE DISCUSSED AND ILLUSTRATEDTHROUGH SAMPLE SEARCHES, WITH AN EMPHASIS ON COST-EFFECTIVE RETRIEVAL.
5397|PRE-MED, THE BRS CURRENT CLINICAL MEDICINE DATABASE.PRE-MED IS A CURRENT CLINICAL MEDICINE FILE WHICH WAS DEVELOPED BYBIBLIOGRAPHIC RETRIEVAL SERVICES AS A COMPANION FILE TO MEDLINE. PRE-MEDCONTAINS CITATIONS FROM 109| JOURNALS IN CLINICAL MEDICINE, NURSING, ANDHOSPITAL LITERATURE. PRE-MED IS SIMILAR IN FORMAT TO MEDLINE AND IS UPDATEDWEEKLY WITH ABOUT 500| CITATIONS. PRE-MED INDEXERS SUPPLEMENT THE JOURNALS'TABLES OF CONTENTS WITH 2|MEDICAL SUBJECT HEADINGS1|. PRE-MED USES ILLUSTRATEDIN THIS ARTICLE INCLUDE BIBLIOGRAPHIC VERIFICATIONS, ACQUISITIONS SEARCHING,UPDATING A MEDLINE SEARCH, AND TABLES OF CONTENTS SERVICES.
5398|SEARCHING THE MEDLARS FILE FOR INFORMATION ON THE ELDERLY.BASED ON A PAPER PRESENTED AT THE NLM ON-LINE DATA BASES CLINIC, 11| FEB 81|. ASTHE ELDERLY POPULATION IN THE US INCREASES, THE CONSEQUENCES FOR THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM ARE SIGNIFICANT. THE VETERANS ADMINISTRATION (VA) HAS CREATED AGERIATRIC RESEARCH, EDUCATION, AND CLINICAL CENTRES PROGRAMME TO PROVIDE CARE,SUPPORT RESEARCH, AND TRAIN PRACTITIONERS IN GERIATRIC MEDICINE. THROUGH THEPARTICIPATION OF THE WADSWORTH VA MEDICAL CENTER LIBRARY IN THIS PROGRAMME,METHODOLOGIES HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED FOR SEARCHING NATIONAL LIBRARY OF MEDICINEDATA BASES FOR INFORMATION ON THE ELDERLY. THESE METHODOLOGIES ARE DESCRIBED;TERMS AND DEFINITIONS IN GERIATRICS ARE EXPLICATED; SAMPLE SEARCH REQUESTS AREEXPLORED; AND ON-LINE STRATEGIES ARE INDICATED.
5399|THE MEASUREMENT OF TERM IMPORTANCE IN AUTOMATIC INDEXING.THE FREQUENCY CHARACTERISTICS OF TERMS IN THE DOCUMENTS OF A COLLECTION HAVEBEEN USED AS INDICATORS OF TERM IMPORTANCE FOR CONTENT ANALYSIS AND INDEXINGPURPOSES. IN PARTICULAR, VERY RARE OR VERY FREQUENT TERMS ARE NORMALLYBELIEVED TO BE LESS EFFECTIVE THAN MEDIUM-FREQUENCY TERMS. RECENTLY AUTOMATICINDEXING THEORIES HAVE BEEN DEVISED THAT USE NOT ONLY THE TERM FREQUENCYCHARACTERISTICS BUT ALSO THE RELEVANCE PROPERTIES OF THE TERMS. THE MAJORTERM-WEIGHTING THEORIES ARE 1|ST BRIEFLY REVIEWED. THE TERM PRECISION AND TERMUTILITY WEIGHTS THAT ARE BASED ON THE OCCURRENCE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE TERMSIN THE RELEVANT, AS OPPOSED TO THE NONRELEVANT, DOCUMENTS OF A COLLECTION ARETHEN INTRODUCED. METHODS ARE SUGGESTED FOR ESTIMATING THE RELEVANCE PROPERTIESOF THE TERMS BASED ON THEIR OVERALL OCCURRENCE CHARACTERISTICS IN THECOLLECTION. FINALLY, EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION RESULTS ARE SHOWN COMPARING THEWEIGHTING SYSTEMS USING THE TERM RELEVANCE PROPERTIES WITH THE MORECONVENTIONAL FREQUENCY-BASED METHODOLOGIES.
5400|ICL THROWS OUT ITS IPA CHALLENGE.BRIEFLY DESCRIBES THE DEVELOPMENT AND FEATURES OF ICL'S INFORMATION PROCESSINGARCHITECTURE WHICH WAS LAUNCHED IN THE SUMMER OF 1980| TO COMPETE WITH IBM.

5402|HIGHLIGHTING TRENDS IN OFFICE AUTOMATION.OFFICE AUTOMATION PRODUCTS AND TECHNIQUES WILL BE ABLE TO MAKE A SIZEABLE DENTIN THE GROWING NUMBER OF OFFICE WORKERS AND BOOST PRODUCTIVITY OF THOSEREMAINING AS WELL AS PROVIDING NEW MARKET FOR EQUIPMENT MAKERS. PRESENTS THERESULTS OF A SURVEY BY OFFICE AUTOMATION CONSULTANTS URWICK NEXOS INTO THEDEVELOPMENTS BEING UNDERTAKEN BY 200| FIRMS. CONSIDERS EQUIPMENT AND BUDGETS,COMPATABILITY, STAFFING AND PROBLEMS. THE SURVEY WILL BE PERFORMED EVERY 6|MONTHS AND THE RESULTS PUBLISHED IN 2|COMPUTING1|.
5403|NAIVE USER IS BIG BUSINESS.AS THE DATA PROCESSING INDUSTRY SEARCHES OUT NEW MARKETS IN WHICH TO GROW, ITCOMES UP AGAINST A HOST OF NEW INEXPERT USERS. REPORTS ON DEVELOPMENTS INUSER-FRIENDLY SYSTEMS, INCLUDING SPEECH AND TOUCH INPUT. ARGUES THAT THEINDUSTRY WHICH SHOULD INVOLVE USERS IN THE SYSTEMS DESIGN FOR THE TRAINING OFDATA PROCESSING DESIGNERS HAS NEGLECTED ERGONOMICS.
5404|DP THROWS AWAY ITS DULL DRAB WEEDS.ASSESSES PLANS BY GOVERNMENT AND THE UK COMPUTER INDUSTRY TO EDUCATE THEPUBLIC AND MOST PARTICULARLY BUSINESSES IN THE BENEFITS OF INFORMATIONTECHNOLOGY DURING INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY YEAR.
