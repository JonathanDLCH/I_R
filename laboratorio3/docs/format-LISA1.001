THESYSTEM IS USED TO PROVIDE SDI TO 2| MAIN GROUPS OF USERS' SCIENTISTS ANDMANAGEMENT OFFICERS. AS FAR AS THE 1|ST USER GROUP IS CONCERNED THE OPERATIONOF THE SDI SERVICE IS SUCCESSFUL. IN 1978|, OUT OF THE 150|,000| SDI ITEMS SENTOUT, ONLY 15|% WERE RETURNED BY THE USERS AS IRRELEVANT. AS FAR AS THE LATTERUSER GROUP IS CONCERNED, THE CONTACT BETWEEN THE INFORMATION CENTRE AND THEMEMBERS OF THE GROUP IS NOT SATISFACTORY. A SURVEY OF THE SDI REQUIREMENTS WASTHEREFORE CARRIED OUT. RESULTS ARE PRESENTED.
1311|UNITED STATES SECONDARY INFORMATION SERVICES IN PHYSICAL SCIENCES ANDENGINEERING' EVOLUTION AND TRENDS FROM SPUTNIK TO NIXON.(DLS THESIS-CATHOLIC UNIVERSITY OF AMERICA, WASHINGTON, DC.) IDENTIFIES,ANALYSES, AND EVALUATES MAJOR FACTORS THAT INFLUENCED THE EVOLUTION OF USSECONDARY INFORMATION SERVICES AND THEIR PRODUCERS IN PHYSICAL SCIENCES ANDENGINEERING, 1957|-71|. KEY PERSONNEL AT 4| PRODUCERS (H.W. WILSON, ENGINEERINGINDEX, INC., US ATOMIC ENERGY COMMISSION, AND THE INSTITUTE FOR SCIENTIFICINFORMATION) HAVE BEEN INTERVIEWED AND SOME OF THEIR PRODUCTS (2|APPLIEDSCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY INDEX, ENGINEERING INDEX, NUCLEAR SCIENCE ABSTRACTS1|,AND 2|SCIENCE CITATION INDEX1|) HAVE BEEN ANALYSED IN DETAIL.
1312|HISTORY OF ABSTRACTING AT CHEMICAL ABSTRACTS SERVICE.THE EVOLUTION OF ABSTRACTS AND ABSTRACTING FOR 2|CHEMICAL ABSTRACTS1| FROM 1907|TO THE PRESENT IS TRACED. THE GROWTH OF SCIENTIFIC PUBLISHING, CHANGES IN THECONTENT, FORM, FORMAT, NATIONAL ORIGIN, AND LANGUAGE OF PRIMARY DOCUMENTS, THESHIFT FROM A LARGE CORPS OF VOLUNTEER ABSTRACTORS TO IN-HOUSE DOCUMENTANALYSTS, AND THE TRANSITION TO MODERN COMPUTER PROCESSING HAVE ALL AFFECTEDTHE PREPARATION AND PUBLICATION OF 2|CHEMICAL ABSTRACTS1|.
1313|CHEMICAL ABSTRACTS (IN ARABIC).DESCRIBES 2|CHEMICAL ABSTRACTS1|, PUBLISHED BY THE AMERICAN CHEMICALASSOCIATION, IN TERMS OF ITS FORMAT, LAYOUT AND THE USE OF ITS INDEXES.
1314|THE ACCURACY OF TELEPHONE REFERENCE SERVICES IN THE SOUTHEAST' A CASE FORQUANTITATIVE STANDARDS.THE TELEPHONE REFERENCE SERVICES OF PUBLIC AND PRIVATE COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITYLIBRARIES IN THE 9| SOUTHEASTERN STATES OF THE USA WERE INVESTIGATED USINGTHEIR RESPONSES TO 12| FACT-SEEKING TELEPHONE QUERIES MADE OVER A 12|-MONTHPERIOD, THEIR 1975| LIBRARY GENERAL INFORMATION SURVEY DATA, AND AQUESTIONNAIRE DESIGNED TO IDENTIFY INDEPENDENT VARIABLES RELATED TO REFERENCESERVICES. ONLY 50|% OF THE TEST QUESTIONS WERE ANSWERED CORRECTLY. INDEPENDENTVARIABLES SUCH AS SERVICE HOURS OR VOLUMES HELD WERE MORE CLOSELY RELATED TOACCURACY OF RESPONSE THAN VARIABLES CONCERNED WITH STAFF, INDICATING THATSTAFF ABILITY TO EXPLOIT A COLLECTION IS MORE CRUCIAL THAN STAFF NUMBERS.CONCLUDES THAT THESE RESULTS SUPPORT CALLS FOR QUANTITATIVE STANDARDS FORREFERENCE SERVICES.
1315|MEASUREMENT OF REFERENCE TRANSACTIONS' AN IN-DEPTH STATISTICAL STUDY OF DEMANDAND CAPACITY IN TWENTY-TWO LIBRARIES OVER A TWO-YEAR PERIOD.DESCRIBES A STUDY OF THE VOLUME OF REFERENCE TRANSACTIONS IN OHIO STATEUNIVERSITY LIBRARY SYSTEM'S DEPARTMENT LIBRARIES IN 1977| AND 1978|. DISCUSSESTHE RESULTS AND CONCLUDES THAT IT IS POSSIBLE TO PREDICT THE VOLUME OFREFERENCE QUESTIONS WITH SOME ACCURACY AND THAT MEANINGFUL INTERPRETATION OFTHE TOTALS CAN BE MADE.
1316|REFERENCE UPDATE. HOW OLD IS IT AND HOW MUCH IS IT WORTH?.IT HAS BEEN ESTIMATED THAT THE USA HAS 22| MILLION 'COLLECTORS OF ONE KIND ORANOTHER, MOSTLY ANOTHER'. ALL WANT TO FIND A FORTUNE IN THEIR ATTIC AND,SOONER OR LATER, MOST COME TO THE LIBRARY TO PROVE THE AUTHENTICITY OF THEIRTREASURE. SUGGESTS SEVERAL PUBLICATIONS AND SERVICES WHICH THE LIBRARIAN CANCONSULT TO DISCOVER THE AGE AND VALUE OF THE COLLECTIONS.
1317|MANAGERIAL RATING' A LIBRARY EFFECTIVENESS MODEL.IN NOV 71|, AN AD-HOC COMMITTEE OF LIBRARIANS AT WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITYWAS ASKED TO DETERMINE IF EFFECTIVENESS MEASURES COULD BE APPLIED TO REFERENCEACTIVITIES AND, IF SO, TO PROPOSE SOME METHOD FOR COLLECTING THE NECESSARYDATA. SEVERAL EFFECTIVENESS MODELS WERE STUDIED AND DISCARDED. THE COMMITTEETHEN TRIED THE MANAGERIAL RATING MODEL, WHEREBY MANAGERS MEET TO IDENTIFYGOALS AND OBJECTIVES, THEN RECONVENE AFTER A GIVEN TIME TO RATE THEIR LEVELSOF ACCOMPLISHMENT. A TRIAL INDICATED THAT THIS MODEL WAS SUITABLE AND THECOMMITTEE REPORTED ACCORDINGLY, BUT NO FULL TRIAL EVER TOOK PLACE AND THECOMMITTEE WAS DISBANDED. SUGGESTS THAT THIS WAS DUE TO THE METHOD'S POSSIBLEDISADVANTAGES AND A LACK OF INTEREST.
1318|ANALYZING THE AVAILABILITY OF REFERENCE SERVICES.THE KEY TO THE OBJECTIVE BRANCHING ANALYSIS OF REFERENCE SERVICES IS THEIDENTIFICATION OF A CHAIN OF ESSENTIALLY INDEPENDENT CONDITIONS WHICH MUST BEMET FOR A PATRON TO OBTAIN THE SERVICE REQUIRED. EXPLORES THE PROBLEMSINVOLVED IN SUCH IDENTIFICATION, ILLUSTRATING EACH PROBLEM WITH DATA COLLECTEDFROM 16| LIBRARIES IN THE LORCOST PROJECT (LEVELS OF OUTPUT RELATED TO COSTS OFOPERATION OF SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL LIBRARIES, A 2|-YEAR STUDY TO COLLECTPRIMARY INFORMATION FROM 50| SUCH LIBRARIES) WHICH ELECTED TO COLLECT DATA ONREFERENCE SERVICE AVAILABILITY.
1319|MEASUREMENT OF REFERENCE SERVICE' REFERENCE STATISTICS 1978|/79|' UNIVERSITYLIBRARY, UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN.THE TYPES OF STATISTICS NEEDED FOR THE ADMINISTRATION OF A REFERENCE PROGRAMMEIN AN ACADEMIC LIBRARY WERE INVESTIGATED BY COLLECTING DATA ON VARIABLES SUCHAS PEAK TIMES OF HEAVIST REFERENCE USE, TYPE OF REFERENCE QUESTIONS, TIMESPENT IN ANSWERING QUESTIONS, TYPE OF EMPLOYEE ANSWERING QUESTIONS, ADEQUACYOF RESPONSES, REASONS FOR INADEQUATE ANSWERS, AND WHETHER PROFESSIONAL STAFFWERE ANSWERING THE MORE SOPHISTICATED QUESTIONS. ANALYSIS OF THE DATAINDICATED THAT SUCH INFORMATION COULD BE USED FOR THE ADMINISTRATION OF ANACADEMIC LIBRARY REFERENCE SERVICE AND THAT A STANDARDISED DATA FORM COULD BEUSED FOR BOTH GENERAL REFERENCE SERVICE AND REFERENCE SERVICE IN A SPECIALISEDSUBJECT AREA.
1320|TEST STUDIES OF THE REFERENCE SERVICES OF GERMAN PUBLIC LIBRARIES.IN AUTUMN 79| A STUDY OF REFERENCE SERVICES IN GERMAN PUBLIC LIBRARIES WASCARRIED OUT. A RESEARCHER POSED AS A LIBRARY USER AT SELECTED LIBRARIES ANDANSWERS HE RECEIVED TO REFERENCE QUERIES WERE THEN EVALUATED FORCOMPREHENSIVENESS AND ACCURACY. THE AIM OF THE STUDY WAS NOT TO ASSESS THEQUALITY OF PUBLIC LIBRARY REFERENCE SERVICES OR TO SINGLE OUT INDIVIDUALLIBRARIES; INSTEAD IT DEMONSTRATES A NEW METHODOLOGY WHICH CAN PRODUCE DATABEYOND THE MERELY QUANTITATIVE DATA WHICH PREVIOUSLY COULD BE INTERPRETED, FORTHE MOST PART, FROM LIBRARY STATISTICS.
1321|DOCUMENT DELIVERY: A BIBLIOGRAPHICAL SURVEY.THE TERM DOCUMENT DELIVERY ENCOMPASSES VARIOUS FORMS OF PROVIDING PRIMARYDOCUMENTS WHICH HAVE ALREADY BEEN PROCESSED IN BIBLIOGRAPHIES AND BY SDISERVICES. DOCUMENT DELIVERY SERVICES NOTIFY THE USERS OF THE POSSIBILITIES OFOBTAINING THE PRIMARY SOURCES IN THE FORM OF PHOTOCOPIES OF PERIODICALARTICLES AND BY INTERLIBRARY LOANS IN THE CASE OF BOOKS. FROM 19| REFERENCES TOLITERATURE DEALING WITH THIS FORM OF DISSEMINATION OF INFORMATION, 5| ARE OFCZECH ORIGIN, THE REST DRAWING ATTENTION TO THE 'UNIVERSAL AVAILABILITY OFPUBLICATIONS' PROGRAMME AND SYSTEMS SUCH AS 'THE MAIL DROP' SERVICES AND'ORIGINAL ARTICLE TEAR SHEET'. PAPERS BY AUTHORS SUCH AS P.D. GILLESPIE, M.B.LINE AND F.W. LANCASTER ARE CITED.
1322|AVAILABILITY OF MATERIALS IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES.DESCRIBES A METHOD DEVELOPED AT THE PRINCE WILLIAM PUBLIC LIBRARY, MANASSAS,VIRGINIA, FOR MEASURING THE RATE OF AVAILABILITY OF MATERIALS SOUGHT BY THEPUBLIC FROM ITS COLLECTIONS. RELATES THIS METHOD TO TRADITIONAL PUBLIC LIBRARYSTANDARDS AND PREVIOUS AVAILABILITY RESEARCH. AVAILABILITY RATE COULD BE USEDAS A PERFORMANCE STANDARD, MEASURING QUALITY OF SERVICE DELIVERED ANDINDICATING A LIBRARY'S STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES.
1323|LONGITUDINAL STUDIES OF BOOK AVAILABILITY.REVIEWS 6| EXPERIMENTAL STUDIES OF BOOK AVAILABILITY CONDUCTED AT THE 2| MAJORLIBRARIES OF CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY, OHIO-THE SEARS LIBRARY (PHYSICALAND BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES, ENGINEERING, MANAGEMENT, AND ECONOMICS) AND THEFREIBERGER LIBRARY (SOCIAL AND BEHAVIOURAL SCIENCES AND THE HUMANITIES). THESTUDIES SHOW HOW CERTAIN MANAGEMENT DECISIONS HAVE INFLUENCED BOOKAVAILABILITY IN THESE LIBRARIES AND HOW CERTAIN OTHER EVENTS, OVER WHICHMANAGEMENT HAD LITTLE CONTROL, HAVE COMPROMISED EFFORTS TO IMPROVE BOOKAVAILABILITY.
1324|BIBLIOGRAPHIC RETRIEVAL VERSUS AVAILABILITY OF DOCUMENTS' THE PROBLEM OFSELECTION.LIBRARIANS ARE CONSTANTLY FACED WITH THE TASK OF SUPPLYING LITERATURE ONRAPIDLY DEVELOPING SUBJECTS, ESPECIALLY IN TECHNOLOGY AND MEDICINE. MECHANICALINFORMATION RETRIEVAL IS APT TO YIELD VAST AMOUNTS OF REFERENCES WHICH HAVE TOBE WEEDED OUT. CRITERIA FOR THIS VARY, BUT ARE USUALLY DICTATED BY NECESSITY,NAMELY THE ACTUAL AVAILABILITY OF DOCUMENTS. THUS THE USER CAN READILY BESUPPLIED WITH THE RELEVANT LITERATURE IN WELL KNOWN JOURNALS STOCKED BY THELIBRARY. IT IS QUESTIONABLE WHETHER THE USER GETS A GOOD COVERAGE INITIALLY,OR WHETHER HE MUST INSIST ON TOTAL RETRIEVAL OF DOCUMENTS. THE PROBLEM OFSELECTION WILL PROBABLY BECOME MORE ACUTE IN THE FUTURE. A POSSIBLE SOLUTIONIS TO ANALYSE THE GROWTH AND SPREAD OF PAPERS RELEVANT TO A SPECIFIC TOPIC INBROADER BASED JOURNALS.
1325|PROGRAMMING WITH A PURPOSE.EXAMINES THE RATIONALE FOR LIBRARY-SPONSORED PROGRAMMES AND CONTENDS THATLIBRARIES MUST ENSURE THAT THESE PROGRAMMES ARE PLANNED AND PURSUED IN TERMSOF A SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE AND THAT THEY GIVE SUFFICIENT RETURN FOR THE TIME ANDEFFORT INVESTED. THIS IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT IN THE FACE OF SHRINKINGBUDGETS AND REDUCED STAFF. (PAPER REPRINTED FROM 2|LIBRARY PR NEWS1|, 1979|).
1326|CULTURE IN HEDEMORA-A CHALLENGE.DESCRIBES THE CULTURAL LIFE OF A SMALL LOCAL AUTHORITY, HEDEMORA (SWEDEN).REMARKS ON THE CONCEPT OF CULTURE AS OUTLINED IN THE OFFICIAL PROGRAMME, WHERETHE DREAMS ARE PUT FORWARD, AND WARNS AGAINST EXPANDING IT INTO ABSURDITY.DIVIDES THE CONCEPT INTO' POPULAR AND AMATEUR CULTURE, NURTURED BY SOCIETIESAND STUDY CIRCLES AND EXEMPLIFIED BY BIENNIAL ART EXHIBITIONS, AN ANTHOLOGY OFPOEMS, CRAFT DEMONSTRATIONS AND MUSICAL EVENTS DURING THE SUMMER; HIGHCULTURE, AS REPRESENTED BY THE DRAMA, ART AND CHAMBER MUSIC SOCIETIES AND THELIBRARY WHICH AIM TO PRESERVE THE CULTURAL HERITAGE; AND CHILDREN'S CULTURE.THIS ASPECT IS NEGLECTED AS THE LIBRARY HAS A POOR CHILDREN'S SECTION AND NOCHILDREN'S LIBRARIAN.
1327|CHILDREN'S LIBRARY ACTIVITIES (IN ARABIC).LIBRARY ACTIVITIES AIM TO ENCOURAGE AND ENLIVEN LIBRARY USE. READINGS ANDTALKS HAVE BECOME AN INTEGRAL PART OF CHILDREN'S LIBRARY SERVICE, AND OTHERACTIVITIES INCLUDE STORY HOURS, DRAMA, QUIZZES, COMPETITIONS AND READINGPROGRAMMES. THESE MOTIVATE READING AND ORIENTATE CHILDREN WITHIN THE LIBRARY.NON-BOOK MATERIALS CAN ALSO BE A MEANS TO ACHIEVE THE OBJECTIVES OF LIBRARYACTIVITIES.
1328|SERIALS DEPARTMENTS' DOOMED TO EXTINCTION?.BECAUSE TASKS AND MATERIALS RELATED TO SERIALS PROCESSING AND USE ARE OFTENDISPERSED IN A LIBRARY, SERIALS SPECIALISTS MUST DEVELOP PERSONAL INFLUENCESTRATEGIES AND USE INFORMAL COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS WHICH CROSS ORGANISATIONALBOUNDARIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A SERIALS DEPARTMENT, SERIALS SPECIALISTS ANDINFORMAL SERIALS COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS WILL CONTINUE TO EXIST. IT IS WIDELYAGREED THAT INFORMAL COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS EMERGE SPONTANEOUSLY INORGANISATIONS AND INDIVIDUALS WITH NO FORMALLY CONFERRED AUTHORITY MAY USEVARIOUS TYPES OF PERSONAL INFLUENCE STRATEGIES TO ACHIEVE ORGANISATIONALOBJECTIVES. WHILE SERIALS PROCESSING AND PUBLIC SERVICE COULD BE MOSTEFFICIENTLY HANDLED THROUGH A SERIALS DEPARTMENT, INFORMAL COMMUNICATIONSYSTEMS, UTILISED BY SERIALS SPECIALISTS, WILL DEVELOP IF SUCH A DEPARTMENTDOES NOT EXIST. IN DETERMINING IF A SERIALS DEPARTMENT HAS A PLACE IN APARTICULAR LIBRARY ORGANISATION, LIBRARY PLANNERS SHOULD BE CONCERNED A BOUTNATURAL COMMUNICATION CHANNELS AND SHOULD TRY TO IDENTIFY INDIVIDUALS WHO CANCOMMUNICATE EFFECTIVELY ACROSS ORGANISATIONAL BARRIERS.
1329|ADLIB FOR LIBRARY MANAGEMENT.LMR INFORMATION SYSTEMS, MAIDENHEAD, ARE RAPIDLY DEVELOPING THEIR SOFTWAREPACKAGE ADLIB (ADAPTIVE LIBRARY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM), A TOOL FOR STORING ANDMANIPULATING BIBLIOGRAPHIC INFORMATION WITH A VARIED SELECTION OF MODULESAVAILABLE FOR PERFORMING DIFFERENT OPERATIONS. PRESENTS A BROAD DESCRIPTION OFTHE TYPES OF OPERATION WHICH CAN BE CARRIED OUT.

1330|WILTSHIRE LIBRARY AND MUSEUM SERVICE' AN INTEGRATED SYSTEM.DISCUSSES THE PROGRESS MADE BY WILTSHIRE'S LIBRARY AND MUSEUM SERVICE INAUTOMATING ITS CATALOGUING AND CIRCULATION SYSTEM. THE SERVICE REJECTED MARCRECORDS AND CREATED ITS OWN PROGRAMMES AND FILES. RETROSPECTIVE CATALOGUECONVERSION HAS BEEN CARRIED OUT. THE CIRCULATION SYSTEM COMPRISES A PLESSEYSATELLITE AND OPERATES IN BATCH MODE AT THE COUNTY'S 6| BUSIEST BRANCHES EACHOF WHICH HAS AT LEAST 1| ISSUE, DISCHARGE AND COMPOSITE TERMINAL. THE FULLRANGE OF HOUSEKEEPING REPORTS AND STATISTICS CAN BE GENERATED. A KWOC INDEX ISCURRENTLY BEING CONSIDERED TO ASSIST WITH TITLE REQUESTS AND MOST OF THESUBJECT QUERIES.
1331|AUTOMATION AT THE LIBRARY OF THE SWISS FEDERAL INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY.AFTER DESCRIBING THE BACKGROUND AND STAFFING OF THE LIBRARY, GIVES DETAILS OFTHE HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE USED FOR THE AUTOMATED HOUSEKEEPING AND RETRIEVALSYSTEMS. THE LIBRARY IS NOW CONSIDERING WHETHER TO ACQUIRE A DEDICATEDCOMPUTER FOR A NEW INTEGRATED SYSTEM, WITH ALL PARTS INTERACTIVELY ON-LINE.
1332|NORTH YORKSHIRE LIBRARY ON-LINE SYSTEM.NORTH YORKSHIRE COUNTY COUNCIL, FORMED IN THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT REORGANISATIONIN 1974|, IS AN AMALGAMATION OF ALL OR PART OF 7| FORMERLY INDEPENDANT LIBRARYSERVICES. IT WAS ESSENTIAL TO STANDARDISE THEIR WORK METHODS SO AUTOMATION WASINTRODUCED AT THE TIME OF REORGANISATION. THE AIM OF THE AUTOMATION WAS TOPROVIDE A CENTRAL CONTROL OF THE NORTH YORKSHIRE LIBRARY BOOKSTOCK AND TOPRODUCE A CATALOGUE OF THE COUNTY STOCK. IT WAS DECIDED TO USE THE BRITISHLIBRARY MARC RECORDS AS THE BASIS FOR THE CATALOGUE INFORMATION. DESCRIBES THEINSTALLATION OF AN ICL 1904|S COMPUTER IN 1976| FOLLOWED BY AN ICL 2976| IN 1979|AND TIMETABLES THE MAJOR EVENTS OF THE AUTOMATION PROCESS FROM 1976|/80|.
1333|DESIGN PRINCIPLES FOR A COMPREHENSIVE LIBRARY SYSTEM.DESCRIBES A PROJECT WHICH TAKES A STEP-BY-STEP OR INCREMENTAL APPROACH TO THEDEVELOPMENT OF AN ON-LINE COMPREHENSIVE SYSTEM RUNNING ON A DEDICATEDCOMPUTER. THE DESIGN SUGGESTED PAYS PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO PRESENT ANDPREDICTED CAPABILITIES IN COMPUTING AS WELL AS TO TRENDS IN LIBRARYAUTOMATION. THE RESULTANT SYSTEM IS NOW IN ITS 2|ND OF 3| RELEASES, HAVING TIEDTOGETHER CIRCULATION CONTROL, CATALOGUE ACCESS AND SERIAL HOLDINGS.
1334|STATE-OF-THE-ART REPORT' DATA INPUT FOR LIBRARIES.REPORT PRODUCED TO PROVIDE PRESENT AND POTENTIAL INFORONICS CUSTOMERS WITH ANOVERVIEW OF TECHNIQUES OF DATA INPUT (FOR CATALOGUING, BIBLIOGRAPHY,INFORMATION AND REFERENCE WORK). EACH PROCEDURE IS DESCRIBED AND AN ESTIMATEOF PROCESSING COSTS IS GIVEN. A FINAL SECTION DEALS WITH SPECIAL PROCEDURESFOR ENCODING BACKLOGS OF DATA WHEN CONVERTING A LARGE DATA FILE TO AMECHANISED SYSTEM.
1335|SERIAL CONTROL IN A DEVELOPED MACHINE SYSTEM.ARGUES THAT THE DEVELOPED MACHINE SYSTEMS OF THE FUTURE WILL NOT BE BASED ONPRESENT LINEAR MACHINE RECORDS, BUT WILL OPERATE UPON A COMPLEX NETWORK OFSIMPLE RECORDS. SUCH A NETWORK WILL HAVE SPECIAL APPLICATION TO THE PROBLEMSRELATING TO THE CONTROL OF BIBLIOGRAPHIC INFORMATION ON SERIALS. THE PROBLEMSOF CHRONOLOGICAL AND HIERARCHICAL LINKAGE OF SERIALS ARE ANALYSED AND RELATEDTO THE PROPOSED NEW SYSTEM. THE PROPOSED SYSTEM WILL ALSO PROVIDE BENEFICIALEFFECTS FOR SERIALS CHECK IN, SERIALS CATALOGUING, AND CATALOGUE USERS.
1336|THE METHODS AND PROBLEMS OF ACQUISITION IN THE RESEARCH LIBRARIES.A TALK GIVEN IN CONNECTION WITH THE 14|TH NORDIC LIBRARY MEETING. EXAMINES THELITERATURE AVAILABLE ON THE SUBJECT OF ACQUISITION. MUCH OF THIS RESULTS FROMSEMINARS AND CONFERENCES. 1| OF THE PROBLEMS ARISING IN THE AREA OF ACQUISITIONIS UNWANTED DUPLICATES. DOUBLE ACQUISITION MAY BE CAUSED BY MONOGRAPHS WHICHHAVE ALREADY BEEN ORDERED AS PART OF A SERIES. CHOICE OF BOOKSELLER IS ALSOCRUCIAL. OTHER PROBLEMS CONCERN CALCULATION OF PRICE INCREASES AND THE USE OFEXCHANGES. THE MECHANISATION OF ROUTINES, SUCH AS CATALOGUING AND ACCOUNTINGAND THE AUTOMATION OF BOOKSELLERS' DATA HAVE CONSEQUENCES FOR ACQUISITION. NEWTENDENCIES IN PUBLISHING, SUCH AS EXCLUSIVE PUBLICATION IN MICROFORM, CANCAUSE PROBLEMS OF CONTROL AND RETRIEVAL. THE PROBLEMS SURROUNDING PHOTOCOPYINGAND LENDING VERSUS PURCHASE ARE STILL BEING DEBATED.
1337|CLAIMING' LUXURY OR NECESSITY?.CLAIMING OF ORDERS IS A TIME-CONSUMING PROCEDURE WHICH IS THOUGHT TO BENECESSARY IN THE ACQUISITIONS PROCESS. EXAMINES THE CURRENT LITERATURERELATING TO CLAIMING, AND THEN CONCENTRATES ON SOME SPECIFIC ASPECTS OF THECLAIMING PROCESS, FOCUSING ON CLAIMS FOR MONOGRAPHS, NOT SERIALS.
1338|DISCOUNTS AND RETURNS, BIDDING AND CONTRACTS, AND GOOD OL' GIFTS.REPORT ON THE ALA/RTSD ACQUISITION OF LIBRARY MATERIALS DISCUSSION GROUP,WASHINGTON, DC, 1| FEB 81|. PAPERS AND PROCEEDINGS ARE SUMMARISED IN 3| SECTIONS'DISCOUNTS AND RETURNS, BY GAIL KENNEDY; BIDS AND CONTRACTS, BY GAIL KENNEDY;AND GIFT POLICIES AND PROCEDURES, BY SCOTT R. BULLARD.
1339|THE FACULTY VERSUS LIBRARIANS IN THE ACQUISITIONS PROCESS' A COMPARATIVEANALYSIS.THE ACQUISITIONS PROCESS IN NIGERIAN UNIVERSITIES IS REVIEWED. A RANDOM SAMPLEOF BOOKS ACQUIRED IN 2| YEARS' TIME AT THE UNIVERSITY OF PORT HARCOURT LIBRARYIN NIGERIA IS TAKEN FOR THE PURPOSE OF DETERMINING THE MAIN GENERATORS OF NEWTITLES FOR THE LIBRARY'S COLLECTION. CIRCULATION RECORDS OF THE BOOKS ARETRACED, AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR BUILDING A WORKING COLLECTION MOST EFFECTIVELYARE MADE.
1340|TOPOGRAPHIC MAP ACQUISITION IN US ACADEMIC LIBRARIES.PRESENTS THE RESULTS OF A RECENT SURVEY OF TOPOGRAPHICAL MAP ACQUISITION IN USACADEMIC LIBRARIES, AND DISCUSSES THE STATUS OF, AND TRENDS IN, TOPOGRAPHICALMAP ACQUISITION PROGRAMMES. CONCLUDES THAT THE LEVEL OF ACQUISITION OF THISMAPPING IS REMARKABLY LOW COMPARED TO THE STATED DEMAND FOR IT, AND THAT THESITUATION REGARDING FOREIGN MATERIAL IS ESPECIALLY CRITICAL. IDENTIFIES THEMAJOR COLLECTING PROBLEMS AS' LOSS OF DEPOSITORY RECEIPTS; INADEQUATE FUNDINGSUPPORT; INFLATED MAP PRICES; INCREASED PRODUCTION; AND GOVERNMENTRESTRICTIONS. SUGGESTS THAT THESE PROBLEMS COULD BE RESOLVED BY OBTAININGBETTER INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL SUPPORT THROUGH PLANNING, ORGANISED ACTION, ANDCOOPERATIVE EFFORTS, AND HIGHLIGHTS THE NEED FOR LIBRARY ADMINISTRATORS TORECOGNISE THE RESOURCE VALUE OF TOPOGRAPHIC MAPPING.
1341|A RATIONALIST'S CRITIQUE OF BOOK SELECTION FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIES.ACADEMIC LIBRARY COLLECTIONS HAVE, HISTORICALLY, BEEN SELECTED BY THE FACULTYOF THE INSTITUTION WHICH THEY LIBRARY SERVES. RECENTLY, HOWEVER, MUCHRESPONSIBILITY FOR COLLECTION DEVELOPMENT HAS DEVOLVED UPON LIBRARIANS WHO AREEAGER TO RETAIN AND AMPLIFY THEIR ROLE IN THIS AREA. ARGUMENTS PRESENTED INFAVOUR OF LODGING COLLECTION DEVELOPMENT RESPONSIBLITY WITH LIBRARIANS ARE,HOWEVER, LESS THAN CONVINCING AND IGNORE IMPORTANT REALITIES TO MAKE THEIRCASE. LIBRARIANS OFTEN CONFUSE THE ABILITY TO SELECT BOOKS WITH ACCOUNTABILITYFOR SUCH SELECTION. ARGUES THAT BOOK SELECTION IS MORE PROPERLY AND MOREADEQUATELY DONE BY FACULTY MEMBERS THAN LIBRARIANS, AND SUGGESTS A WAY OFDEALING WITH THE PROBLEM OF ACCOUNTABILITY OFTEN ENCOUNTERED WHEN FACULTY ARERESPONSIBLE FOR SELECTION.
1342|TOWARD A COMPREHENSIVE COLLECTION DEVELOPMENT POLICY FOR PARTIAL U.S.DEPOSITORY LIBRARIES.LIBRARY LITERATURE HAS LONG IGNORED THE PROBLEM OF COLLECTION DEVELOPMENT FORU.S. GOVERNMENT PUBLICATIONS. REGIONAL DEPOSITORIES ARE NOT ADVERSELY AFFECTEDBY THIS OVERSIGHT. HOWEVER, THE PARTIAL DEPOSITORY LIBRARY SUFFERS THECONSEQUENCES. OFTEN IN THE PAST, THE SOLE CRITERION FOR THE BUILDING OF APARTIAL DEPISITORY COLLECTION HAS BEEN ACCRETION WITHOUT REGARD FOR OTHERSALIENT FACTORS. AT PRESENT AND IN THE FORESEABLE FUTURE, FISCAL EXIGENCY WILLCAUSE INCREASING DEMANDS TO BE MADE ON THE LIBRARY'S BUDGET AND SPACE. INORDER TO MAKE JUDICIOUS DECISIONS WHICH WILL PERMIT THE DEPOTISORY COLLECTIONTO GROW IN A MANNER RESPONSIVE TO ITS OWN NEEDS, AS WELL AS TO VARIOUSCURRICULAR AND COMMUNITY NEEDS, A FRAMEWORK OF POLICY MUST EXIST. IT IS INTHIS CONTEXT THAT A POLICY STATEMENT IS PRESENTED.
1343|THE ACQUISITION OF SERIALS AT THE BENSON LATIN AMERICAN COLLECTION.DESCRIPTION OF THE SERIALS ACQUISITION POLICY OF THE NETTIE LEE BENSON LATINAMERICAN COLLECTION-A SPECIAL RESEARCH COLLECTION OF THE GENERAL LIBRARIES OFTHE UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AT AUSTIN.

1345|PURCHASING FOR LIBRARIES AND INFORMATION CENTERS. PART IIA-BIDS AND CONTRACTS.FOR PART 1| SEE 80|/3195|. LIBRARY AND INFORMATION MANAGERS HAVE BECOMEINCREASINGLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE FISCAL MANAGEMENT FUNCTIONS IN THEIRORGANISATIONS AS THEY HAVE WATCHED INFLATION ERODE THE PURCHASING POWER OFTHEIR BUDGETS. STAFF MEMBERS NEED TO UNDERSTAND MORE MANAGERIAL CONCEPTS, SOMEOF WHICH ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THE PURCHASING PROCESS. BIDS AND CONTRACTS ARECONSIDERED TO BE 2| OF THE MAJOR ELEMENTS OF THE PURCHASING PROCESS. PROVIDES ACONCEPTUAL UNDERSTANDING OF BIDS AND CONTRACTS AND A SET OF GUIDELINES FORCOMPETITIVE BIDDING AND CONTRACTS.
1346|TAMING THE SERIALS BUDGET.SUGGESTS THAT UNIVERSITY AND COLLEGE LIBRARIES CAN PUT THEIR UNMANAGEABLYOVERWEIGHT SERIALS BUDGET ON A SENSIBLE DIET BY LIMITING NEW SUBSCRIPTIONS;ANALYSING THE SERIALS COLLECTION; PERHAPS DEVELOPING A SERIALS COLLECTIONBASED ON THE BOOK COLLECTION PROFILE; AND THEN DEVELOPING A SENSIBLE SERIALSCOLLECTION POLICY WITH THE LONG-TERM FUTURE IN MIND.
1347|EMERGING STANDARDS FOR BOOK ACQUISITION.DESCRIBES THE WORK OF THE US BOOK INDUSTRY SYSTEMS ADVISORY COMMITTEE; THE USEOF ITS COMPUTER-TO-COMPUTER ORDER FORMAT; THE FORMAT'S POTENTIAL; AND THEFUTURE USE OF COMPUTERS IN COMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN PUBLISHERS, WHOLESALERS, ANDLIBRARIES.
1348|EFFECTIVENESS OF AUTOMATED INTERLIBRARY LOAN.EXAMINES THE BORROWING PATTERNS OF 15| ACADEMIC MEMBERS OF THE SOUTH CENTRALRESEARCH LIBRARY COUNCIL (A MULTI-TYPE LIBRARY CONSORTIUM IN CENTRAL NEW YORKSTATE), THE EFFECTS OF THE INTRODUCTION OF THE OCLC/ILL SUBSYSTEM ON THEIRINTERLIBRARY LOAN PATTERNS, AND THE TRANSITION FROM THE USE OF NYSILL (NEWYORK STATE INTERLIBRARY LOAN) TO USE OF OCLC/ILL. FINDS THAT OCLC/ILL HAS HADA MAJOR IMPACT-MATERIAL REQUESTED IS ARRIVING SIGNIFICANTLY FASTER, THE LOADON MAJOR RESEARCH LIBRARIES HAS BEEN REDUCED, AND SMALLER LIBRARIES CAN NOWSHARE THE LOAD IN FILLING INTERLIBRARY LOAN TRANSACTIONS. 25|-50|% OF REQUESTEDMONOGRAPHS ARE LESS THAN 5| YEARS OLD-PERHAPS IT WOULD BE MORE EFFICIENT TOPURCHASE THEM. RETROSPECTIVE COLLECTION CONVERSION WOULD BE OF VALUE TOINTERLIBRARY LOANS IF CARRIED OUT WITHIN THE NEXT 5| YEARS.
1349|STATISTICAL DETERMINATION OF BOUND VOLUME JOURNAL HOLDINGS IN A SCIENCELIBRARY.DISCUSSES A METHOD FOR THE DETERMINATION OF THE NUMBER OF BOUND JOURNALVOLUMES IN A SCIENCE LIBRARY USING A SAMPLING TECHNIQUE. THE METHOD ALLOWS THECALCULATION OF THE EXTENT OF JOURNAL RUNS FOR BOTH CURRENT AND NON-CURRENTTITLES.

1351|A STRATEGY FOR ARCHIVING GOVERNMENT DATA TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THE RESEARCHCOMMUNITY.THE GOVERNMENT IS THE GREATEST COLLECTOR AND USER OF INFORMATION. STATISTICSCANADA HAS IDENTIFIED 2|,352| MAJOR GOVERNMENT DATA BANKS IN CANADA. IN RESPONSETO A GROWING RECOGNITION THAT GOVERNMENT HAS GONE TOO FAR IN ITS DATACOLLECTION ACTIVITIES, IT IS TRYING TO REDUCE ITS 'PAPERBURDEN'. PERHAPS ONESOLUTION IS TO INSTITUTE A RATIONAL AND CONSISTENT STRATEGY FOR ARCHIVINGTHESE GOVERNMENT DATA, BUT STILL MEET THE NEEDS OF THE RESEARCH COMMUNITY.SUGGESTS THAT THE CANADIAN GOVERNMENT MUST ESTABLISH THE INFORMATION OVERWHICH IT HAS OWNERSHIP AND THE CONDITION OF SUCH OWNERSHIP; NO GOVERNMENTRECORD MAY BE DESTROYED OR ALTERED WITHOUT CONSENT FROM THE DOMINION ARCHIVISTOR HIS DESIGNATE; AND THE DOMINION ARCHIVIST MUST HAVE THE RIGHT TO DECLAREANY GOVERNMENT RECORD OR COPY THEREOF AN ARCHIVAL RECORD.
1352|ON THE STABILITY OF DISTRIBUTIONS OF THE TYPE DESCRIBED BY TRUESWELL.APPLICATION OF RULES FOR WEEDING THAT ARE BASED UPON THE UNEQUAL DISTRIBUTIONOF DEMAND OVER THE COLLECTION REQUIRE THAT THE DISTRIBUTION REMAIN STABLE OVERTIME.

THE TYPE OF LABELSCHOSEN AND THE PROCEDURES USED FOR LABELING ITEMS AND FOR ENTERING THE BARCODEINFORMATION INTO THE MACHINE-READABLE RECORD ARE DISCUSSED.
1365|ORIEL COMPUTER SERVICES-CIRCULATION SYSTEM.ORIEL'S APPROACH TO THE DESIGN OF A CIRCULATION SYSTEM MATCHES ITS APPROACH TOITS OTHER LIBRARY AUTOMATION SERVICES. IT HAS BEEN DESIGNED IN A MODULARFASHION TO MEET THE NEEDS OF A PARTICULAR LIBRARY. THE APPROACH IS TO DISCUSSWITH STAFF THE LIBRARY NEEDS AND REQUIREMENTS AND FROM THESE TO DESIGN ASYSTEM WHICH MEETS THOSE NEEDS AT MINIMUM COST. A CIRCULATION SYSTEM HAS BEENOPERATING SUCCESSFULLY IN A PUBLIC LIBRARY IN EUROPE FOR SEVERAL MONTHS. THEGENERAL SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS, SYSTEM ELEMENTS, NETWORK, HARDWARE, SYSTEMFACILITIES AND OTHER SERVICES ARE DESCRIBED IN DETAIL.
1366|GEAC IN ACTION AT THE UNIVERSITY OF HULL.THE GEAC TERMINALS AT HULL UNIVERSITY ARE STANDARD, COMPRISING KEYBOARD, VDUAND LIGHTPEN AND THE SYSTEM IS RUN ON A GEAC 8000| MINI. FILES ARE STORED ON2|X300| MEGABYTE DISCS. SINCE HULL HAD NO EXISTING MACHINE-READABLE CATALOGUE, AFULL RECORD OF ALL STOCK HAD TO BE COMPILED. THE AUTOMATED CIRCULATION CONTROLSYSTEM AT PRESENT OPERATES ONLY ON A SMALL SECTION OF THE STOCK, BUT IT ISHOPED TO EXTEND THIS TO ALL CLASSES. ECONOMIC STRINGENCY OBLIGED HULL TODISCARD ITS FLEXIBLE AND EFFECTIVE MANUAL SYSTEM AND REPLACE IT WITH ANEFFICIENT AND EASILY-USED SYSTEM. GEAC FULFILLED THE UNIVERSITY'S NEEDS, ANDTHE PARTIAL SYSTEM OPERATING AT PRESENT MEETS HULL'S REQUIREMENTS.
1367|THE JOY OF CATALOGUING: ESSAYS, LETTERS, REVIEWS, AND OTHER EXPLOSIONS.FEELINGS THAT CATALOGUING CODES ARE COMPLETELY SENSIBLE AND TRUSTWORTHY ANDABOVE REPROACH HAVE PRODUCED FEWER, AND GENERALLY LESS CREATIVE AND AUTONOMOUSCATALOGUERS, POORER CATALOGUE ACCESS TO LIBRARY RESOURCES, GREATERMYSTIFICATION, MORE FRUSTRATION FOR PATRONS AND STAFF, AND AN ALARMINGPASSIVITY AMONGST CATALOGUERS AND REFERENCE LIBRARIANS ALIKE. PRESENTS PAPERS,REVIEWS AND ESSAYS, SELECTED FOR THEIR INTELLIGIBILITY, 'FINDABILITY' ANDFAIRNESS, WHICH ATTEMPT TO REDRESS THE BALANCE.
1368|DIRECTIONS FOR RESEARCH IN INDEXING, CLASSIFICATION, AND CATALOGING.SPECULATES ON DIRECTIONS FOR RESEARCH IN THE FIELD OF BIBLIOGRAPHICAL CONTROL,WHERE BIBLIOGRAPHICAL CONTROL IS TAKEN TO INCLUDE INDEXING, CLASSIFICATION,AND CATALOGUING. THE POSITION TAKEN IS THAT WHILE CONCERNS OF A HOW-TO-DO-ITNATURE DRIVE THIS FIELD'S RESEARCH, WHICH IS OF AN EVALUATIVE OR DEVELOPMENTALNATURE, THERE IS A STRONG NEED FOR THIS RESEARCH TO BE BACKED BY BASICTHEORETICAL RESEARCH.

OUTLINES THE CATALOGUING PROCEDURE ATTHE COLLEGE, MENTIONING WEAKNESSES IN EDITOR'S CONCEPTION, THOSE FACILITIESTHAT ARE OF LITTLE PRACTICAL VALUE, ITS ADVANTAGES, AND COST. CONCLUDES THATON-LINE INPUT VIA EDITOR IS AN EFFICIENT AND ECONOMIC MEANS OF PRODUCTION FORA COMPUTER-BASED CATALOGUE.
1373|ONLINE PERIODICALS AT HULL COLLEGE OF HIGHER EDUCATION.DESCRIBES THE OPERATION, WITHIN THE COLLEGE'S MULTI-SITE LIBRARY, OF ANON-LINE PERIODICALS CONTROL SYSTEM, DEVELOPED COMPLETELY IN-HOUSE, WHICHREPLACED AN INEFFICIENT MANUAL SYSTEM. EACH SUBSCRIPTION RECORD HOLDS DETAILSOF TITLE, ALTERNATIVE TITLE, LOCATION CODE AND SUBJECT CODE AND IS COMPOSED OFFIXED-LENGTH FIELDS WITH A-CHARACTER ALPHANUMERIC CONTROL NUMBER. FIELDSINCLUDE FREQUENCY, ISSUES PER VOLUME AND PRICE, AND EACH ENTRY MAY BE TERMED'ALIVE' OR 'INACTIVE'. LIBRARY RECORDS WERE THEN CONVERTED TO MACHINE-READABLEFORM AND MAY NOW BE SORTED BY LOCATION, TYPE AND SUBJECT/DEPARTMENT. THESIMPLE ACCESSIONING PROCEDURES ARE DETAILED. THE SYSTEM WHICH WENT LIVE IN JAN81| IS PROVING VERY EFFICIENT IN THIS PARTICULAR COLLEGE SITUATION.
1374|THE UTLAS CATSS SYSTEM.UTLAS (UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO LIBRARY AUTOMATION SYSTEMS) HAS BEEN SUPPLYINGCOMPUTER-BASED SYSTEMS, SERVICES AND PRODUCTS TO LIBRARIES IN BOTH ENGLISH ANDFRENCH SINCE 1973|. IT TAKES A TOTAL APPROACH TO LIBRARY AUTOMATION, OFFERING ABROAD SPECTRUM OF FULLY INTEGRATED MANAGEMENT SUPPORT SERVICES.

1379|QUALITY ISSUES IN RETROSPECTIVE CONVERSION PROJECTS.LATE IN DEC 79| A QUESTIONNAIRE WAS SENT TO 446| MEMBERS OF OCLC, INC., TOASCERTAIN THEIR VIEWS ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF A SPECIAL MINIMAL STANDARD TO BEUSED ONLY FOR RETROSPECTIVE CONVERSION PROJECTS. IT WAS FOUND THAT 74|.5|% WOULDOPPOSE THE CREATION OF A NEW LOWER STANDARD. DESPITE THE POSSIBILITY OF EXTRAREQUIREMENTS TO UPGRADE AN EARLIER CATALOGUE RECORD TO MEET CURRENT STANDARDS,LIBRARIANS, IN GENERAL, SHOWED A STRONG COMMITMENT TOWARD QUALITY ANDCOMPLIANCE WITH CURRENT STANDARDS.
1380|PATTERNS IN THE USE OF OCLC BY ACADEMIC LIBRARY CATALOGING DEPARTMENTS.A SURVEY OF THE CATALOGUING DEPARTMENTS OF 166| OCLC-MEMBER ACADEMIC LIBRARIESSHOWED THAT LIBRARIES DID NOT RELY EXCLUSIVELY ON OCLC FOR CARD PRODUCTION ANDTHAT A LARGE MAJORITY DID NOT ACCEPT NON-LIBRARY OF CONGRESS OCLC RECORDSWITHOUT SUBSTANTIAL CHECKING. THE SURVEY INDICATED ALSO THAT LIBRARIES THATUSED OR PLANNED TO USE THEIR OCLC-MARC TAPES GENERALLY WERE MORE CONCERNEDWITH THE COMPLETENESS AND ACCURACY OF THEIR OCLC-MARC TAPE RECORDS THANLIBRARIES THAT DID NOT PLAN TO USE THEIR TAPES.
1381|EXPERIMENTAL ON LINE CATALOG FOR THE DARTMOUTH COLLEGE LIBRARIES.THIS ON-LINE PILOT PROJECT DEMONSTRATES THE FEASIBILITY OF USING THE OCLCTRANSACTION TAPES TO CREATE AN ON-LINE CATALOGUE, AND THE UTILITY OF THE BRSDATA BASE STRUCTURE FOR LOADING THIS DATA AND FOR ON-LINE SEARCHING. REPORTNOT AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
1382|THE SYSTEM IS THE SOLUTION' AN APPROACH TO INCREASED TECHNICAL SERVICESPRODUCTIVITY.IN 1978|, ONTARIO'S UNIVERSITY OF WATERLOO DISCOVERED A BACKLOG OF BOOKS IN ITSCATALOGUING DEPARTMENT AFTER A CATALOGUING REVISION AND THE IMPLEMENTATION OFFULL MARC CODING. A NEW APPROACH TO COPING WITH THE BACKLOG PROVED VERYSUCCESSFUL. A 5|-POINT PROCEDURE WAS FOLLOWED' (1|) EVALUATE PRESENT OPERATIONAND VARIOUS TASKS; (2|) ANALYSE THESE TASKS TO DETECT NON-PRODUCTIVE AREAS ORAREAS IN NEED OF IMPROVEMENT; (3|) DESIGN A SOLUTION; (4|) DOCUMENT THE NEWPROCEDURES; AND (5|) IMPLEMENT THE SOLUTION. THE PROCEDURES HIGHLIGHTED THEFACT THAT MORE TIME WAS SPENT IN FINDING CATALOGUE COPY THAN IN ANY OTHERTASK. WHEN THIS TIME WAS CUT DOWN THROUGH THE USE OF THE MARC DISTRIBUTIONSERVICE OF THE NATIONAL LIBRARY, THE SYSTEM PROVED SUITABLY STREAMLINED TOELIMINATE THE BACKLOG IN THE CATALOGUING DEPARTMENT.

THE NEED FOR RULES FOR THE REGISTRATION OF DIFFERENTMEDIA, WHICH AACR 2| SUPPLIES, IS PRESSING. BUT A DIRECT TRANSLATION OF AACR 2|INTO SWEDISH IS NOT POSSIBLE, AS SOME POINTS NEED DISCUSSION, SUCH AS AACR 2|'SRESTRICTIVE RULES FOR INSTITUTIONS AND THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN AACR 2| AND SOMEISBD VARIANTS. THE COMMITTEE HOPES TO PRESENT A MANUAL IN JAN 82|. THECONSEQUENCES OF THIS SHOULD BE ELIMINATION OF DIFFERENCES IN CATALOGUING RULESFOR RESEARCH AND PUBLIC LIBRARIES AND MORE RATIONAL USE OF BIBLIOGRAPHICMATERIAL, BOTH NATIONALLY AND INTERNATIONALLY.

1420|TELETEXT AND VIEWDATA' A NEW CHALLENGE FOR THE DESIGNER.TELETEXT AND VIEWDATA DISPLAYS PRESENT A STRONG CHALLENGE TO THE INFORMATIONDESIGNER. THE MONOSPACED DOT MATRIX CHARACTERS ARE RELATIVELY CRUDE IN THEIRDESIGN, AND THEIR POSITIONING IS DETERMINED BY A FIXED GRID. THE GRAPHICSFACILITY IS ALSO SOMEWHAT CRUDE. THE SCOPE FOR TYPOGRAPHIC AND SPATIAL CODINGOF INFORMATION IS THEREFORE VERY LIMITED. THERE IS, HOWEVER, THE POSSIBILITYOF USING COLOUR AS A WAY OF CODING INFORMATION. 7| COLOURS, INCLUDING WHITE,ARE AVAILABLE, BUT THEY ARE NOT OF EQUAL BRIGHTNESS AND THIS HAS IMPORTANTIMPLICATIONS FOR LEGIBILITY. BEARING IN MIND THE CONSTRAINTS AND FREEDOMOFFERED BY THIS KIND OF DISPLAY, WAYS OF PRESENTING TEXT, TABLES, INDEXES ANDGRAPHICS OF VARIOUS KINDS ARE DISCUSSED.
