23|FEELING THE DRAFT: QUALITY IN OUR ETHICAL DEBATE.REPORT ON THE DRAFT CODE OF PROFESSIONAL ETHICS PRODUCED BY THE LIBRARYASSOCIATION WORKING PARTY ON ETHICS. LIBRARIANS AND INFORMATION WORKERS IN THEUK ARE LATECOMERS TO THE QUESTION OF PROFESSIONAL ETHICS. A US CODE WASDEVELOPED IN 1938|, AND OTHER PROFESSIONS HAVE HAD CODES SINCE THE 19|THCENTURY. THE OVERRIDING REASON FOR SUCH A CODE IS THE PROTECTION OF THECLIENT, BUT IT ALSO OFFERS PROTECTION FOR THE PROFESSIONALS THEMSELVES, ANDCOULD ENHANCE THE STATUS OF THE PROFESSION. AT THE VERY HEART OF THE LA CODEIS RESPONSIVE AND RESPONSIBLE PROFESSIONALISM.
24|PROFESSIONAL ETHICS.CRITIQUE OF THE DRAFT CODE ON PROFESSIONAL ETHICS PRODUCED BY THE LIBRARYASSOCIATION. THE CODE IS BADLY WRITTEN, CONFUSED, SILLY, CONTRADICTORY ANDTHREATENS TO BRING THE LA INTO DISREPUTE. NOTES PROVIDE LITTLE ILLUMINATION;CODES OF ETHICS DO NOT PER SE BRING PROFESSIONALISM; A LIBRARIAN'S PRIMARYDUTY IS OFTEN TO A CORPORATE BODY; THERE IS CONFUSION ABOUT POSSIBLE CONFLICTSIN SERVICE; AND THE LIBRARY ASSOCIATION IS IMPUDENT IN SUGGESTING THAT IT WILLIMPOSE SANCTIONS ON THOSE WHO FAIL TO KEEP ABREAST OF DEVELOPMENTS INLIBRARIANSHIP.

DEFINES FACT INACCORDANCE WITH THE MARXIST THEORY AS AN ELEMENT OF OBJECTIVE REALITY. FACT ININFORMATICS IS A PIECE OF KNOWLEDGE WHOSE OBJECTIVE VERITY HAS BEENSUFFICIENTLY PROVED. FACTUAL INFORMATION AS A PIECE OF KNOWLEDGE, INVESTIGATEDIN THEORY AND PROVED IN PRACTICE, CANNOT BE CHALLENGED; IT CAN, HOWEVER, HAVEVARIOUS INTERPRETATIONS.

34|LIBRARY SCIENCE IN THEORY AND PRACTICE.IN THE USA, UK AND COMMUNIST COUNTRIES, LIBRARY SCIENCE IS NOW FULLYESTABLISHED AS A SCIENTIFIC DISCIPLINE AND INCLUDED AMONGST UNIVERSITYFACULTIES. SINCE THE 19|TH CENTURY, HOWEVER, OPINION IN WEST GERMANY HAS BEENDIVIDED AS TO WHETHER LIBRARY SCIENCE HAS ITS OWN THEORETIC BASIS OR WHETHERIT CONSISTS OF PURELY PRACTICAL KNOWLEDGE. EXAMINATION OF THE RESPECTIVEARGUMENTS SUGGESTS THAT LIBRARY SCIENCE CAN BE REGARDED AS AN APPLIED SCIENCECLOSELY LINKED WITH OTHER DISCIPLINES, E.G. INFORMATION SCIENCE,COMMUNICATION, CYBERNETICS AND LINGUISTICS. HISTORICAL ASPECTS OFLIBRARIANSHIP EMPHASISED HITHERTO SHOULD PLAY ONLY A SUBORDINATE ROLE; THEMAIN EMPHASIS MUST BE ON SCIENTIFICALLY BASED, ECONOMIC LIBRARY ADMINISTRATIONLINKED WITH RESEARCH.

HOWEVER, AS THE DECADEPROGRESSED, SEVERAL LEGISLATIVE BILLS FAVOURABLE TO PUBLIC LIBRARIES WEREENACTED. THESE FOLLOWED THE REVENUE SHARING ACT OF 1972|, WHICH PERMITTEDGOVERNMENT UNITS TO APPROPRIATE FUNDS ONLY FOR THE PURPOSES FOR WHICH THEIROWN REVENUES WERE EXPENDED. IN 1978|, REVENUE-SHARING FUNDS INCREASEDDRAMATICALLY AS A RESULT OF THE STATE LEGISLATORS' SECOND ATTEMPT TO PROVIDEPUBLIC LIBRARIES WITH ACCESS TO REVENUE-SHARING FUNDS, WITH THE PASSAGE OFSENATE-ENROLLED ACT NO. 208|.

SPECIALISED EDUCATION, ESPECIALLY IN-SERVICE COURSES, IS NECESSARY,BUT LIBRARIANS' COMPLAINTS ABOUT COMPUTERISATION MAY STEM FROM SEVERALPHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL FACTORS NOT YET FULLY EXPLORED. STAFF MAY FEELRULED BY THE MACHINE UNLESS ENCOURAGED TO UNDERSTAND THE SYSTEM THOROUGHLY ANDTAKE PART IN ORGANISING WORK PROCESSES. IN SETTING UP SAMKAT AT THE DANISHNATIONAL LIBRARY, CATALOGUERS HAVE BEEN FULLY INVOLVED IN THE 1|ST(CATALOGUING) STAGE, AND WILL TAKE PART IN FUTURE DEVELOPMENT OF THE SYSTEM TOENSURE CONSISTENCY. WHEN STAFF FEEL AT EASE WITH THE COMPUTER, ITS ADVANTAGESINCLUDE MAKING THEIR WORK LESS STRENUOUS BUT MORE STIMULATING (PROVIDEDGOOD-QUALITY PRINT-OUTS ARE ATTAINED) AND IMPROVING INTER-LIBRARY COOPERATIONAND SERVICE TO READERS. LIBRARIANS SHOULD REMAIN RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR WORKINGCONDITIONS, AND INTRODUCE TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPME NTS AT A SUITABLE TEMPO.

187|MICRO COMPUTER SYSTEMS.THE MICRO COMPUTER SYSTEM IS NOT UNIQUE, BUT JUST A SIMPLER VERSION OF THEMINI AND MAINFRAME. IT IS ONLY CHEAPER BECAUSE LESS IS PROVIDED, THEFACILITIES ARE INADEQUATE FOR MANY OPERATIONS, AND IF SIGNIFICANT ONCE-OFFPROGRAMME DEVELOPMENT IS REQUIRED, MOST COST ADVANTAGES OF A MICRO SYSTEM MAYBE LOST. DISCUSSES QUESTIONS WHICH SHOULD BE RAISED WHEN CONSIDERING MICROCOMPUTER SYSTEMS IN THE CONTEXT OF LIBRARY AUTOMATION AND INFORMATIONRETRIEVAL. SUGGESTS THAT PROCESSOR, MEMORY AND LOGIC BOARDS SHOULD COST NOMORE THAN 
62|,000|, AND MASS STORAGE SHOULD BE LIMITED TO FLOPPY DISCS AND/ORCASSETTE.
188|THE ROLE OF MICROCOMPUTERS IN LIBRARIES.RECENT ADVANTAGES IN LARGE SCALE INTEGRATION OF ELECTRONIC COMPONENTS ANDATTENDANT ADVANCES IN MASS STORAGE TECHNOLOGY OPENING THE POSSIBILITY OFAUTOMATION FOR MANY SMALL LIBRARIES THAT UP UNTIL NOW COULD NOT AFFORD TOAUTOMATE.

196|MOTIVATING EMPLOYEES.FOR MANY YEARS RESEARCHERS IN THE FIELD OF MANAGEMENT HAVE BEEN STUDYING,TESTING, THEORISING AND WRITING ABOUT JOB MOTIVATION, ITS CAUSES AND EFFECTS.JOB MOTIVATION, WHICH IS THE AMOUNT OF EFFORT DIRECTED TOWARD ATTAINING GOALSDESIRED BY THE ORGANISATION, IS A SUBJECT ABOUT WHICH ALL MANAGERS OF PEOPLE,INCLUDING LIBRARIANS, MUST HAVE SOME KNOWLEDGE.
197|MOTIVATION AND STAFF DEVELOPMENT.ARGUES THAT STAFF DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMMES AND ACTIVITIES DO NOT, IN THEMSELVES,MOTIVATE STAFF.

PROVIDES A CASE STUDY OF THE APPLICATION OF THESTAFF DEVELOPMENT PROCESS IN A LIBRARY SETTING.
200|TRAINING WITHOUT EDUCATION: A LOST CAUSE.FORMAL AND ONGOING TRAINING OF COMPUTER SEARCHERS IS FUNDAMENTAL TO THESUCCESS OF ANY COMPUTERISED INFORMATION SERVICE. ARGUES THAT ALL LIBRARY STAFFSHOULD BE EDUCATED IN THE USE OF COMPUTERS FOR REFERENCE WORK SO THAT COMPUTERSEARCHING CAN BE FULLY INTEGRATED INTO THE NORMAL EVERYDAY SERVICE. LIBRARIESMUST NOT FEEL THAT THEY HAVE FAILED IF THEY DECIDE TO ASK FOR A COMPUTERSEARCH RATHER THAN HUNT THROUGH BOOKS FOR THEMSELVES. BRIEFLY DISCUSSES THEADVANTAGES OF ON-LINE ACCESS TO REFERENCE BOOKS AND INDEXES TO POPULARPERIODICALS AND NEWSPAPERS.
201|PHILOSOPHER AND LIBRARIAN SIDE BY SIDE.THE HISTORY OF LIBRARIANSHIP REVEALS A CONSIDERABLE NUMBER OF LIBRARIANS WHOHAVE ALSO BEEN ACTIVE AS PHILOSOPHERS. IT WOULD APPEAR THAT THE LIBRARIAN ANDTHE PHILOSOPHER MUST SHARE A NUMBER OF COMMON CHARACTERISTICS. THE MOSTSTRIKING OF THESE CHARACTERISTICS IS THE UNBOUNDED THIRST FOR KNOWLEDGE. INADDITION, ALTHOUGH COURSES OF STUDY ARE AVAILABLE IN BOTH DISCIPLINES, THEKNOWLEDGE AND EXPERTISE OF BOTH LIBRARIAN AND PHILOSOPHER IS ONLY ACQUIREDAFTER YEARS OF EXPERIENCE. BOTH GROUPS SEEK TO CREATE ORDER IN THE MATERIALWHICH FORMS THE FOCUS OF THEIR ACTIVITIES AND ALTHOUGH NOT INNOVATORSTHEMSELVES, WILLINGLY OFFER THEMSELVES IN THE SERVICE OF OTHERS.

203|ON FINNISH LIBRARY ARCHITECTURE.THE AUTHOR IS OF THE OPINION THAT THE GROUND FLOOR IS THE MOST IMPORTANT AREAOF ANY LIBRARY BUILDING, AND IT SHOULD NOT BE USED FOR SECONDARY ACTIVITIES.IN JYVASKYLA LIBRARY BUILDING, AS IN MANY FINNISH LIBRARY BUILDINGS, THEACTUAL LIBRARY IS ACCOMMODATED ABOVE THE GROUND FLOOR LEVEL. A COMPETITION FORA DESIGN IS NORMALLY ORGANIZED. THIS WAS ALSO THE CASE IN JYVASKYLA. THIS ISNOT THE WAY TO GET BEST RESULTS, BECAUSE THE COOPERATION BETWEEN THE ARCHITECTAND THE LIBRARIAN ONLY BEGINS AFTER THE DESIGN IS COMPLETE. AN ARCHITECTSHOULD BE CHOSEN CAREFULLY AND THE LIBRARIAN OR A LIBRARY EXPERT AND THEARCHITECT SHOULD COOPERATE THROUGHOUT THE DESIGN OF THE BUILDING.
204|IS A FITTED CARPET HARMFUL TO ALLERGIC PEOPLE?.FITTED CARPETS HAVE BECOME POPULAR IN LIBRARIES BECAUSE THEY CUT DOWN NOISE.BUT IF CARPETS ARE NOT KEPT CLEAN AND ROOMS WELL VENTILATED THEY CAN CAUSEPROBLEMS FOR PEOPLE SUFFERING FROM RESPIRATORY AILMENTS. NEW CARPETS DO NOTCAUSE THIS TROUBLE. RESEARCH IN SWEDEN AND FINLAND SHOWS THAT CARPETS STAYDIRTY EVEN AFTER GOOD VACUUMING. GIVES COMPARATIVE FIGURES FOR THE AMOUNT OFDUST CAUSED BY DIFFERENT TYPES OF FLOOR COVERINGS, WHICH IS WHAT CAUSES THEALLERGIES.
