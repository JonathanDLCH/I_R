REPORTS THE SPEECH BY THE DANISH LIBRARY ASSOCIATION'S CHAIRMAN, KARL JOHANMORTENSEN, TO THE MEETING OF THE KOMMUNERNES LANDSFORENING (NATIONALASSOCIATION OF LOCAL AUTHORITIES), WHERE THE QUESTION HAD EARLIER BEEN RAISEDOF HOW CULTURE COULD BE DISSEMINATED TO LARGER CIRCLES. IT WAS ARGUED THATEXPANSION OF LIBRARY ACTIVITIES WAS NOT ENOUGH TO REACH THOSE UNFAMILIAR WITHLIBRARIES. THE INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK HAD PREVENTED GENUINE DECENTRALISATIONAND POPULARISATION OF CULTURE. LIBRARIES WITH RIGID MANAGEMENT AND DEMAND FORQUALIFIED STAFF WERE PREVENTING THEIR USE AS LOCAL CULTURE CENTRES. SOLUTIONSINVOLVING GREATER COORDINATION WITH OTHER LOCAL ACTIVITIES WERE OFFERED.AGAINST THIS MORTENSEN ARGUES THAT THE 1964| LIBRARY ACT PROMOTEDDECENTRALISATION AND THAT LIBRARIES MORE THAN OTHER INSTITUTIONS ARE REACHINGTHE BROAD POPULATION. WARNS AGAINST REDUCTION OF LIBRARY ACTIVITIES IN ORDERTO HELP THE GRASS ROOTS MOVEMENTS. LOCAL AUT HORITIES NEED THE SUPPORT OF THESTATE FOR LIBRARY SERVICES. THE DEBATE THAT FOLLOWED AND THE REPLY FROM THENATIONAL ASSOCIATION'S CHAIRMAN STRESSED THAT LIBRARIES WERE NOT UNDER ATTACK.
4159|LIBRARY USE AS A LEISURE ACTIVITY.     INTRODUCTORY SPEECH TO THE STUDY SESSION OF THE WORKING PARTY FOR COUNTYLIBRARY SYSTEMS, NOORDWIJKERHOUT, 1| SEPT 81|. IN THE NETHERLANDS, THE RISE INLIVING STANDARDS SINCE WORLD WAR II HAS OUTSTRIPPED THE INCREASE IN LEISURETIME. IN ADDITION THE AVERAGE CITIZEN DEVOTES A LARGE PROPORTION OF HISINCREASED PURCHASING POWER TO ACQUIRING PRIVATE COMFORTS. WHEREAS BEFORE THEWAR MOST PEOPLE VISITED THE CINEMA OR THEATRE FOR ENTERTAINMENT, AND TRAVELLEDBY BUS OR TRAIN, NOWADAYS THEY WATCH TELEVISION AT HOME AND TRAVEL BY PRIVATECAR. SIMILARLY RESEARCH SHOWS THAT THE AVERAGE CITIZEN USES THE LIBRARY NOT ASA SUBSTITUTE FOR A PRIVATE COLLECTION OF BOOKS BUT TO SUPPLEMENT HIS OWNCOLLECTION. AS THE ECONOMIC RECESSION DEEPENS THERE IS A REAL DANGER THAT THEGOVERNMENT WILL TURN PUBLIC LIBRARIES INTO RECREATIONAL CENTRES AND CREATE NEWLIBRARIES AS INFORMATION CENTRES.
4160|BIBLIOGRAPHY AS A SCIENCE: FROM TEXTUAL CRITICISM TO BIBLIOMETRICS.     A REVISED VERSION OF A PAPER PRESENTED AT A BRAZILIAN CONFERENCE IN 1975| AND1|ST PUBLISHED IN 1979|, DISCUSSING 20|TH CENTURY DEVELOPMENTS FROM THE WORK OFPOLLARD ONWARDS. REFERENCE IS MADE TO MAJOR PUBLICATIONS IN THE FIELD BYSCHOLARS SUCH AS COLE, ZOLTOWSKI, GASKELL AND LEVEBRE. THE SEARCH FORBIBLIOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION IS DISTINGUISHED FROM TRUE BIBLIOGRAPHICALRESEARCH, AND THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A SCIENTIFIC BASIS FOR BIBLIOGRAPHY THROUGHSTATISTICAL ANALYSIS IN BIBLIOMETRICS IS OUTLINED. AN ACCOUNT IS GIVEN OF THEPROCEDURES OF MACROBIBLIOGRAPHICAL ANALYSIS, AND OF THE DEVELOPMENT OFMICROBIBLIOGRAPHICAL ANALYSIS WITH THE INTRODUCTION OF CITATION INDEXES. THENEXT ADVANCE ENVISAGED IS THE CONSTRUCTION OF CITATION CHAINS WHEN AHUMANITIES CITATION INDEX BECOMES AVAILABLE, WHICH MAY WELL HAVE MAJORREPERCUSSIONS ON THE HISTORY OF IDEAS.

IN THE 1978|/79| ACADEMIC YEAR STUDENTS OF THE FREDERIK MULLER SCHOOL OFLIBRARIANSHIP CARRIED OUT A SURVEY INTO CENSORSHIP IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN THENETHERLANDS. 15| LIBRARIES, VARYING IN SIZE FROM SMALL TOWN TO LARGE CITYLIBRARIES, WERE SELECTED, 5| IN AREAS WITH A STRONG PROTESTANT LEANING, 5| INROMAN CATHOLIC AREAS AND 5| IN AREAS WITH NO STRONG RELIGIOUS CONVICTIONS. THERESULTS SHOWED THAT THE NUMBER OF CONTROVERSIAL BOOKS STOCKED BY LIBRARIES WASIN DIRECT PROPORTION TO THE SIZE OF THE LIBRARY. IN ADDITION, DESPITE THEASSURANCES OF ALL LIBRARIANS THAT NO FORM OF CENSORSHIP WAS PRACTISED, FEWERBOOKS OF A POLITICALLY-CONTROVERSIAL OR PORNOGRAPHIC NATURE WERE TO BE FOUNDIN LIBRARIES IN RELIGIOUS AREAS. IT IS CLEAR THAT CENSORSHIP IS STILL ALIVE INTHE NETHERLANDS IN 1981| UNDER THE GUISE OF 'REJECTION ON ETHICAL GROUNDS'.
4167|THE LITERATURE OF POPULATION STUDIES' CITATION PATTERNS AND BIBLIOGRAPHICCONTROL.     (DLS THESIS-COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY).

PAPER PRESENTED AT LIBRARY HISTORY SEMINAR VI 'LIBRARIES & CULTURE', AUSTIN,TEXAS, 19|-22| MAR 80|. INCREASINGLY, US HISTORIANS ARE CARRYING OUT RESEARCHINTO THE ACCULTURATION OF IMMIGRANTS TO THE USA. THE ARCHIVES OF THE JEWISHLABOUR BUND, HELD IN NEW YORK CITY ARE ONE OF THE RAREST IMMIGRANTCOLLECTIONS, EXCEPTIONAL BECAUSE OF THEIR AGE, THEIR COMPREHENSIVENESS, ANDTHEIR FOUNDERS' INTENTION TO PRESERVE THE PRESENT FOR THE FUTURE. THECOLLECTION, INCLUDING PAMPHLETS, NEWSPAPERS AND POSTERS WAS ESTABLISHED IN1899| IN GENEVA, TO SERVE AS THE ARCHIVE-LIBRARY OF THE THEN ILLEGAL SOCIALDEMOCRATIC JEWISH LABOUR BUND OF RUSSIA, POLAND AND LITHUANIA.

IMPORTANCE OF PROMOTING CLASSICAL FICTION IS UNDERVALUED. CHILDRENREAD CLASSICS AS PART OF THE SCHOOL SYLLABUS BUT BID FAREWELL TO THEM ONLEAVING. CLASSICAL LITERATURE'S ROLE IN EDUCATION IS UNDERESTIMATED BECAUSE OFFEELINGS THAT CHILDREN ARE TOO YOUNG TO UNDERSTAND THEM OR ARE NOT INTERESTED.CHILDREN SHOULD BE TAUGHT HOW EVERYTHING 'INTERCONNECTS' IN RUSSIANLITERATURE, WHICH ASKS THE SAME ETERNAL QUESTIONS AS 'MODERNS'. RUSSIANCLASSICS OUGHT TO BECOME INDISPENSABLE TO YOUNG PEOPLE'S LIVES. SCHOOLS ANDLIBRARIES MUST FAMILIARISE CHILDREN WITH THE CLASSICS, COMBINING TOWARDS THEIRINTELLECTUAL DEVELOPMENT.
4178|HARBORING TRADITION WITH COMPUTERS, BINDINGS, AND GENEALOGICAL COLLECTIONS.     THE MACON/BIBB COUNTY PUBLIC LIBRARY, GEORGIA, IS ONE OF THE USA'S MOSTAUTOMATED PUBLIC LIBRARIES, BUT ITS SERVICES ARE BASED UPON THE TRADITIONALCONCEPT THAT PATRONS COME TO A LIBRARY TO SEEK GOOD BOOKS AND RELIABLE ANSWERSTO THEIR QUESTIONS.

TRACES THE DEVELOPMENT OF US INTERLIBRARY COOPERATION DURING THE 20|TH CENTURY.UNSTRUCTURED COOPERATION, INDICATED BY SUCH ACTIVITIES AS THE NATIONAL UNIONCATALOG AT THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS (1901|) AND THE 1|ST INTERLIBRARY LOAN CODE(1917|), CONTINUES TODAY. SINCE WORLD WAR II, STRUCTURED COOPERATION, INCLUDINGREGIONAL NETWORKS, SPECIAL ACTIVITIES, AND MULTIPURPOSE COOPERATIVES, HASBECOME MORE PROMINENT. A DEFINITION OF LIBRARY COOPERATION IS OFFERED, ANDDIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE TERMS SYSTEM, NETWORK, AND CONSORTIUM ARE EXPLORED.PROBABLE FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS IN LIBRARY COOPERATION ARE MENTIONED, INCLUDINGAPPLICATIONS OF COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY AND POTENTIAL POLITICAL BENEFITS OFMULTITYPE LIBRARY COOPERATION.

ARGUES THE CASE FOR COOPERATION BETWEEN PUBLIC LIBRARIES AND OTHERINSTITUTIONS SPECIFICALLY SERVING THE PRINT-HANDICAPPED. A SYSTEM FORPRODUCING AUDIO CASSETTES IS PROPOSED AS AN EXAMPLE, PRESUMING ONLY THEEXISTING RESOURCES AND FUNDING, WITHOUT RELYING ON GOVERNMENT GRANTS.
4189|COOPERATIVE PROGRAM FOR COLLECTING GOVERNMENT DOCUMENTS BETWEEN DEPOSITORY ANDNON-DEPOSITORY LIBRARIES.     NON-DEPOSITORY LIBRARIES CAN INCREASE THE NUMBER OF GOVERNMENT DOCUMENTSAVAILABLE WITHIN A REGION BY DEVELOPING COOPERATIVE STORAGE AND HANDLINGAGREEMENTS WITH AREA DEPOSITORY LIBRARIES. ALL CONDITIONS OF USE AND RETENTIONFOR DEPOSITORY MATERIALS APPLY, AND ACTUAL DOCUMENTS REMAIN THE RESPONSIBILITYOF THE DESIGNATED DEPOSITORY LIBRARY. THE DETAILS OF SUCH A COOPERATIVEPROGRAMME BETWEEN RENSSELAER POLYTECHNIC INSTITUTE AND TROY PUBLIC LIBRARY AREDESCRIBED.

A PRELIMINARY DISCUSSION BRIEFLY INTRODUCES THE ISSUESINVOLVED IN ESTABLISHING AN INTEGRATED NATIONAL NETWORK, IN THE FACE OF AGOVERNMENT POLICY OF DECENTRALISATION. THE ABF PROGRAMME FOR ACHIEVINGUNIFICATION IN SERVICE PROVISION, PERSONNEL ALLOCATION, AND PERSONNELTRAINING, IS THEN ELABORATED. IN EACH CASE DETAILS ARE GIVEN OF THE EXISTINGORGANISATION OF RESOURCES, THE ADVANTAGES OF UNIFICATION OUTLINED, AND THEMEANS OF IMPLEMENTING A POLICY OF INTEGRATION INDICATED.
4192|PRODUCTION AND CONSUMPTION OF INFORMATION IN THE UNIVERSITY.     ARGUES THAT THE INFORMATION SPECIALIST SHOULD, IN MEDIATING BETWEEN PRODUCERSAND CONSUMERS, EXERCISE DISCRIMINATION IN ASSESSING INFORMATION NEEDS ANDADOPT A QUALITATIVE RATHER THAN A QUANTITATIVE APPROACH. DISCUSSES THEQUANTITATIVE STUDIES OF INFORMATION PRODUCTION PUBLISHED OVER THE LAST 20|YEARS, AND PROPOSES AN ALTERNATIVE VIEWPOINT BASED ON BAUDRILLARD'SSOCIOLOGICAL ANALYSIS OF CONSUMPTION, EMPHASISING THE SOCIAL IMPLICATIONS OFCONSUMER DEMANDS. IF THE SOCIOLOGICAL PRESSURES BEHIND USER NEEDS AREUNDERSTOOD, THE INFORMATION SPECIALIST IS THEN ABLE TO BOTH MONITOR USERREQUIREMENTS AND EXERCISE SOME INFLUENCE OVER THE PRODUCTION OF INFORMATIONDESIGNED TO MEET SOCIAL PRESSURES RATHER THAN INTELLECTUAL OBJECTIVES.
4193|PUBLIC LIBRARIES AS A COMPULSORY PROVISION BY LOCAL AUTHORITIES.     AN INCREASING NUMBER OF PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT THE POSITION OF LOCAL AUTHORITYCULTURAL SERVICES MUST BE CLARIFIED IN THE 1980|S. THE LIBRARY SERVICE IS APART OF LOCAL CULTURE THAT CANNOT BE OVERLOOKED AND SO IT IS ESSENTIAL FOREACH LIBRARY TO COOPERATE WITH OTHER LIBRARIES, CULTURAL ORGANISATIONS ANDLOCAL GOVERNMENT ADMINISTRATORS. A DECISION IS NEEDED AS TO WHETHER LOCALAUTHORITIES ARE NOT ONLY ENTITLED BUT ALSO OBLIGED TO ADMINISTER PUBLICLIBRARIES. THE CONCEPT OF A NATIONAL LIBRARY LAW SHOULD BE RENOUNCED IN FAVOUROF A CONCEPT WHEREBY LOCAL AUTHORITIES IMPOSE ON THEMSELVES THE OBLIGATION TOPROVIDE PUBLIC LIBRARIES. LOCAL COMMUNITIES SHOULD DRAW UP THEIR OWN LIBRARYPLANS AND PROVIDE THE MONEY; EACH STATE SHOULD THEN PROVIDE FINANCIALASSISTANCE FOR LIBRARY WORK OUTSIDE THESE AREAS.

THE ASSOCIATION SUPPORTS THIS PROPOSAL,BUT WITH SOME RESERVATIONS. THUS IT SUPPORTS THE INCLUSION OF BOTH PUBLIC ANDRESEARCH LIBRARIES IN ONE ACT, BUT OPPOSES THE DECISION TO REMOVE SCHOOLLIBRARIES. IT SUPPORTS THE PROPOSED AMALGAMATION OF THE LIBRARY INSPECTORATEAND THE OFFICE OF NATIONAL LIBRARIAN, AND THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A LIBRARYCOUNCIL, ALBEIT WITH A DIFFERENT COMPOSITION. IT WOULD HAVE LIKED TO SEE ARTCOLLECTIONS PUT ON A PAR WITH MUSIC COLLECTIONS, AND LIBRARY PROVISION FORINTERMEDIATE EDUCATION AND OUTREACH ACTIVITIES MADE OBLIGATORY. THE LIBRARYCENTRE, OF WHOSE BOARD THE ASSOCIATION HAS A MAJORITY MEMBERSHIP, IS WILLINGTO COOPERATE IN DISCUSSIONS ON THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE NATIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHYAND URGES THAT ITS FINANCING BE CLARIFIED SOON. THE ASSOCIATION REGARDS THEAMOUNT SET ASIDE FOR TRANSITION OF P ART-TIME LIBRARIES TO FULL-TIME STATUSTOO LOW. IT SUPPORTS THE CHANGE TO BLOCK GRANT FINANCING.
4195|STATUTES AND THE PROVISION OF LIBRARY SERVICES FOR THE PRINT HANDICAPPED.     CONTRASTS THE EDUCATION ACT, 1958| (VICTORIA), WHICH ATTEMPTS TO FINANCEPROVISION FOR SERVICES FOR HANDICAPPED CHILDREN IN CONJUNCTION WITH THEIRNORMAL SCHOOLING WITH THE WESTERN AUSTRALIAN ACT WHICH STRESSES THE SEPARATEPROVISION FOR HANDICAPPED AND OTHER CHILDREN.

AN ECONOMETRIC ANALYSIS HAS BEEN MADE OF COST AND SERVICE DATA REPRESENTING 65|SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL LIBRARIES. THE DATA INCLUDE LIBRARIES IN A VARIETY OFINSTITUTIONAL ENVIRONMENTS, RANGING IN OPERATING BUDGET FROM $20|,000| TO$2|,000|,000| PER YEAR. ALL THE DATA ARE WELL DESCRIBED BY A SINGLE FORMULA,WHICH EXHIBITS ECONOMIES OF SCALE, AND FIXED RELATIVE UNIT COST OF THE VARIOUSDIMENSIONS OF SERVICE. (FOR PART 1| SEE PREVIOUS ABSTRACT).

REPORT OF DISCUSSION BETWEEN FRIEDRICH ANDRAE, KLAUS HOHLFELD, ULRICH THIEM,HANS JOACHIM VOGT AND 2|BUCH UND BIBLIOTHEK1| HELD AT THE GERMAN LIBRARYASSOCIATION'S ANNUAL CONFERENCE IN BREMEN, NOV 81|. IT IS A LIBRARIAN'S JOB TOPROMOTE THE USE OF BOOKS, A JOB WHICH MUST BE TAKEN MORE SERIOUSLY THAN EVERBEFORE. RECENT SURVEYS HAVE SHOWN THAT ABOUT 40|% OF THE POPULATION ARE LIBRARYUSERS. WHERE POSSIBLE, ECONOMIES SHOULD BE MADE IN WORKING METHODS RATHER THANIN SERVICES; THIS DEMANDS MORE CENTRALISATION. IT IS BETTER TO PUT BOOKS INLAUNDRY BASKETS ON WINDOW LEDGES AND ON PAVEMENTS THAN TO TAKE THEM AWAY FROMTHE PUBLIC COMPLETELY OR TO MAKE THEM AVAILABLE ONLY FOR RESTRICTED PERIODS.LIBRARIES MAKE A VALUABLE CONTRIBUTION TOWARDS THE MASTERY OF LIFE'S PROBLEMS,AN ARGUMENT WHICH POLITICIANS AND ADMINISTRATORS ARE BEGINNING TO APPRECIATE.

TURNING POINTS IN PUBLICLIBRARY SERVICE TO CHILDREN SEEM TO REVOLVE AROUND 3| FACTORS' USE OF THEGENERALIST APPROACH IN PROVIDING SERVICE; THE CHANGING STATUS OF THE CENTRALCHILDREN'S LIBRARY; AND DEVELOPING SCHOOL/PUBLIC LIBRARY COOPERATION.CHILDREN'S LIBRARIANS MUST EXERT PRESSURE FOR EXAMINATION OF LIBRARY SCHOOLCURRICULA AND RECOMMENDED PROGRAMMES THAT PREPARE CHILDREN'S LIBRARYSPECIALISTS.
4207|IT IS USELESS TO ECONOMISE WHEN MONEY IS IN SHORT SUPPLY.     THE GERMAN ECONOMY IS ADAPTING WITH DIFFICULTY TO THE RECESSION, TO THEDETRIMENT OF PUBLIC BUDGETS. CULTURE IS IMPORTANT DURING ECONOMIC CRISES,THEREFORE CULTURAL BODIES CANNOT RENEGE ON THEIR SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITIES.THRIFT MAY NOT ALWAYS BE THE MOST ECONOMIC PROCEDURE. AN ANALYSIS IS MADE OFSTATISTICS ON LIBRARY EXPENDITURE BY LARGE AND SMALL LOCAL AUTHORITIES IN WESTGERMANY IN 1975|-79| TO ILLUSTRATE THE IMPORTANCE OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEENSTAFFING COSTS AND THE TOTAL BUDGET. A CAREFUL LIBRARY POLICY MUST RECOGNISETHE POSSIBILITIES AND LIMITATIONS OF ADAPTING TO THE FINANCIAL SITUATION INTHE LIGHT OF ITS SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITIES. IF RATIONALISATION METHODS ARECARRIED OUT EFFICIENTLY, THE LIBRARY SERVICE CAN ADAPT IN THE RIGHT WAY.
4208|ONLINE IN SAUDI ARABIA.     FACTORS INHIBITING THE USE OF COMPUTERS IN SAUDI LIBRARIES ARE OUTLINED. THERECENT TREND TOWARDS A GROWTH IN THE USE OF COMPUTERS, IN SPITE OFDIFFICULTIES, IS NOTED IN THE LIGHT OF LABOUR SHORTAGES AND STAFFING PROBLEMS.USE OF COMPUTERS IS SEEN AS ONE WAY TO IMPROVE LIBRARY SERVICES WITHOUTEXPANDING STAFF.

4271|APPLYING H.A. SIMON'S MODEL OF LIMITED RATIONALITY TO SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH ANDCOMMUNICATION.     A GREAT NUMBER OF SPECIALIST AND NON-SPECIALIST QUESTIONS ARE ASKED ABOUTSCIENTIFIC RESEARCH, CONCERNING OBJECTIVES, METHODS, RESULTS, ORGANISATION,POLICIES AND INFORMATION SOURCES. SUCH QUESTIONS CAN BE COLLECTED AND ANALYSEDFOR COMMON DENOMINATORS BUT RECENT WORK BY ANDREWS AND HIS COLLABORATORS(1979|) INDICATES THIS APPROACH TO BE INADEQUATE. USES SIMON'S CONCEPT OFLIMITED RATIONALITY AS A GENERAL MODEL OF INDIVIDUAL AND ORGANISATIONALOPERATION, WHICH IS APPLIED AS AN ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK FOR INVESTIGATINGRESEARCH ACTIVITIES. THE MODEL DOES HELP IN EXPLANATION OF OBSERVATIONSFREQUENTLY MADE ABOUT RESEARCH BEHAVIOUR PATTERNS' PREFERENCE FOR INFORMALINFORMATION SOURCES AND PERSONAL CONTACTS, AND THE FORMATION OF INFORMALGROUPS AND NETWORKS. RESEARCHERS AND THEIR ORGANISATIONS WOULD APPEAR TOFUNCTION WITHIN THE BOUNDARIES OF LIMITED RATIONALITY. THIS MODEL CAN ALSO BEUSED TO PREDICT POTE NTIAL PROBLEMS IN SCIENTIFIC COMMUNICATION, SUCH AS THECONCEPTION AND USE OF THESAURI AND DATA BANKS. THE QUALITY OF SUCH INFORMATIONSOURCES IS CRUCIAL TO THE FUTURE OF SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH, HENCE THE IMPORTANCEOF UNDERSTANDING RESEARCH BEHAVIOUR.

4324|EITHER WE MOVE OR ELSE WE STOP ACCEPTING MORE BOOKS.     DESCRIBES THE DEPOSIT LIBRARY AND ITS SPACE PROBLEMS. UNLESS THE LIBRARY MOVESFROM ITS PRESENT ACCOMMODATION IN THE BASEMENT OF THE LIBRARY SCHOOL WITHINHALF A YEAR, IT WILL HAVE TO START REFUSING BOOKS FROM PUBLIC LIBRARIES. THELIBRARY'S PURPOSE IS TO STORE BOOKS WHICH HAVE BEEN CULLED FROM PUBLICLIBRARIES AND TO LEND OR GIVE THEM TO OTHER LIBRARIES, AND THEREFORE IT MUSTNECESSARILY GROW AT A TIME WHEN OTHER LIBRARIES CONTRACT. THE LIBRARY BEGAN IN1968| WITH 1400| SQ.M.; LATER A FURTHER 175| SQ.M. WERE ADDED FOR SHELVING AND1000| SQ.M. IN A WAREHOUSE ELSEWHERE. A SUITABLE BUILDING OF 7700| SQ.M. IS NOWAVAILABLE CHEAPLY. WITH AN INCREASE OF 25|,000| VOLUMES A YEAR, THIS WOULDSECURE ENOUGH SPACE UNTIL THE 90|S. RUNNING COSTS WILL BE 5|.1| MILLION KR. IN 82|AS COMPARED TO THE PRESENT 3|.6| MILLION KR., AND COST OF ESTABLISHMENT WILL BE2|.7| MILLION KR. THE DANISH LIBRARY ASSOCIATION, THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OFLOCAL AUTHORITIES AND THE LIBRAR Y COUNCIL HAVE NOW RECOMMENDED THAT THE MONEYSHOULD COME FROM THE PUBLIC LIBRARIES' DISPOSITION FUND, NOT OTHERWISE USEDFOR SUCH PURPOSES, AS THE SOURCE OF THE LIBRARY'S FINANCE, THE PUBLICLIBRARIES' JOINT APPROPRIATION, WOULD BE UNABLE TO COPE. THE LIBRARY IS A LASTRESORT, AFTER THE CENTRAL LIBRARIES, FOR ORDINARY PEOPLE FOR THE LENDING OFOLDER BOOKS AND MEETS 55|% OF ENQUIRIES, A FIGURE WHICH WOULD BE HIGHER IF ACATALOGUE OF HOLDINGS EXISTED.

4326|THE ISSUE CONTROL IS RIDDLED WITH ERRORS.     STATEMENTS BY THE DANISH LIBRARIANS' UNION SHOW THAT LIBRARIANS KNOW NOTHINGABOUT WORK IN THE TECHNICAL DEPARTMENTS AND ISSUE DESKS, WHERE OFFICE TRAINEDSTAFF, NOT LIBRARIANS, WORK; THEY THEREFORE TEND TO REJECT AUTOMATION IN THESEAREAS. THEY ARE, ON THE OTHER HAND, TRAINED IN BIBLIOGRAPHICAL SERVICES ANDHENCE APPROVE OF AUTOMATION OF THESE. THE FACT IS, HOWEVER, THAT PRESENTMANUAL ISSUE CONTROL SYSTEMS ARE WORKING VERY POORLY' BOOKS ARE BEING RECALLEDWHICH ARE ALREADY RETURNED OR HAVE NEVER BEEN BORROWED. REFERS TO A NEGLECTEDREPORT OF 1979| BY A COMMITTEE OF HEADS OF ISSUE DESKS, WHICH RECOMMENDSEXPERIMENTS WITH AUTOMATED ISSUE CONTROL SYSTEMS AND IN PARTICULAR SUPPORTS ANAUTOMATIC RECALL SYSTEM. THE ISSUE DESK STAFF OF THE AUTOMATED OLSTYKKELIBRARY HAVE ALSO EXPRESSED POSITIVE VIEWS ON THEIR AUTOMATIC SYSTEM, VIEWSFOR WHICH THEY HAVE BEEN REPRIMANDED BY THE LIBRARIANS' UNION.

EXAMINES THE POSSIBILITY OF DEVELOPING SUCHMULTI-MEDIA FINDING AIDS.
4330|ON SOME PROBLEMS OF SUBJECT CATALOGUING AT THE WISMAR COLLEGE OF ENGINEERINGLIBRARY.     THE WISMAR COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING LIBRARY USES A CLASSIFIED CATALOGUE FORSUBJECT CATALOGUING WHICH WAS INTRODUCED IN 1970|. IT IS BASED ON THEHIERARCHIC UNIVERSAL CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM OF THE ROSTOCK UNIVERSITY LIBRARY.THIS IS SUITABLE FOR THE STOCK OF THE WISMAR LIBRARY WHICH COVERS A VERY WIDERANGE OF SUBJECTS. THE SYSTEMATIC CATALOGUE HAS A FLEXIBLE NOTATION SYSTEMWHICH CAN COVER COMPLEX TERMS EXTENDING TO 6| COLUMNS AND ALSO HAS KEYWORDS'GENERAL, GEOGRAPHICAL, CHRONOLOGICAL, LINGUISTIC AND LITERATURE. THESYSTEMATICS WORK AT THE WISMAR LIBRARY HAS SEVERAL OBJECTIVES' TO ADAPT THEROSTOCK UNIVERSITY LIBRARY'S UNIVERSAL CLASSIFICATION TO THE SPECIALISEDWISMAR COLLECTION; TO OVERCOME THE PROBLEMS ARISING FROM SCIENTIFICDEVELOPMENTS BY EXPANDING AND BRINGING UP TO DATE THE SCHEDULES; AND TO WORKOUT NEW SYSTEMS IN CASES WHERE THE LIMITS OF EXISTING ONES ARE REACHED. WHERETHIS HAS BEEN NECESSARY 2| C ATALOGUES HAVE SOMETIMES BEEN IN EXISTENCESIMULTANEOUSLY TO AVOID LOSS OF INFORMATION FOR THE USER.
4331|DOCUMENTARY ANALYSIS OF VISUAL RESOURCES' THE METHODS USED TO DATE.     A COMPREHENSIVE ACCOUNT, BASED ON RECENT LITERATURE COVERING' DIFFICULTIES INANALYSING IMAGES FOR DOCUMENTATION PURPOSES; CATALOGUING AND SUBJECT HEADINGS,WITH REFERENCE TO LISTS AND ILLUSTRATED CATALOGUES PREPARED BY SPECIALLIBRARIES; THE CLASSIFICATION OF IMAGES, IN RELATION TO THE INADEQUACY OFCONVENTIONAL SYSTEMS, SYSTEMS DEVELOPED FOR SLIDE COLLECTIONS, ARCHIVALCLASSIFICATIONS, AND CLASSIFICATION OF PHOTOGRAPHIC TECHNIQUES; AND INDEXINGPROCEDURES USED BY SPECIAL LIBRARIES IN THE FIELDS OF PETROLEUM, MANAGEMENTAND URBAN PLANNING, MEDICINE, EDUCATION, ARCHAEOLOGY AND THE HISTORY OF ART,THE PLASTIC ARTS, AND METHODS DEVELOPED TO TAKE ACCOUNT OF THE SEMIOLOGICALCONNOTATIONS OF IMAGES. BIBLIOGRAPHICAL REFERENCES ARE PROVIDED FOR ALLMETHODS AND SYSTEMS REFERRED TO. THE NEED FOR FURTHER RESEARCH TO DEVELOPWHOLLY SATISFACTORY TECHNIQUES IS EMPHASISED.
4332|ON THE ACCESS TO CARTOGRAPHIC COLLECTIONS IN GDR LIBRARIES.     SUITABLE CATALOGUING AND CLASSIFICATION OF CARTOGRAPHIC COLLECTIONS OFFERS THEUSER EASIER ACCESS TO THESE MATERIALS AND OFFERS THE LIBRARIAN A FUNDAMENTALBASIS FOR PROVIDING INFORMATION AND PROMOTING OPTIMAL USE OF HIS COLLECTIONS.HERE, THE METHODS OF CLASSIFICATION WHICH ARE USED IN EAST GERMANY ARELINEATED USING EXAMPLES FROM THE MOST SIGNIFICANT MAP COLLECTIONS.
4333|AUTHORITY CONTROL' UNNECESSARY DETAIL OF NEEDED SUPPORT?.     AUTHORITY CONTROL IS THE SET OF PROCEDURES WHICH DETERMINES THE USE OFCONSISTENT NAMES AND TERMINOLOGY, CHANGING RELATIONSHIPS AMONG SCHOLARLYDISCIPLINES, CORPORATE BODIES, AND GOVERNMENT AGENCIES. GIVES EXAMPLES OFAUTHORITY WORK FOR PERSONAL NAMES, CORPORATE NAMES, GOVERNMENT AGENCIES,SERIES TITLES AND SUBJECT HEADINGS. SUGGESTS THAT AUTHORITY CONTROL ISESSENTIAL BECAUSE' CATALOGUES ARE GROWING AND BECOMING MORE DIFFICULT TO USESO THE USER MAY EASILY GET LOST WITHOUT AN AUTHORITY STRUCTURE TO PROVIDEGUIDANCE; AND IF LIBRARIES FOLLOW GENERALLY THE SAME STANDARDS IN ESTABLISHINGBIBLIOGRAPHIC RECORDS, THE TASK OF MATCHING RECORDS AMONG LIBRARIES WILL BEMADE CONSIDERABLY EASIER.

4337|NETWORK SERVICE CENTERS AND THEIR EXPANDING ROLE.     THE GROWTH OF OCLC AS AN AUTOMATED LIBRARY RESOURCE-SHARING SYSTEM HAS BEENMADE POSSIBLE IN PART BY INTERMEDIARY ORGANISATIONS, OR NETWORKS, THATFUNCTION AS MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTING AGENTS FOR OCLC SERVICES. AS THEY HAVEGROWN, THE NETWORKS HAVE TAKEN ON OTHER ROLES. THE RESULTS OF A SURVEY OF THEDIRECTORS OF THE NETWORKS REVEAL PATTERNS OF SERVICE BEYOND OCLC, AND INDICATETHAT THE NETWORKS PROVIDE, OR PLAN TO PROVIDE, AUTOMATED LIBRARY SUPPORTSYSTEMS THEMSELVES. SURVEY RESULTS ALSO REVEAL BROKERAGE OF OTHER AUTOMATEDSERVICES, NETWORKS' REVENUE SOURCES, STAFF SIZE AND GROWTH, AND FUTURE PLANS.
4338|ENTRY OF LOCAL DATA ON OCLC' THE OPTIONS AND THEIR IMPACT ON THE PROCESSING OFARCHIVAL TAPES.     THE OCLC SYSTEM ALLOWS FOR A GREAT DEAL OF FLEXIBILITY IN ENTERING INSTITUTIONSPECIFIC DATA FOR AN ITEM. IN THE PAST, POLICIES FOR ENTERING LOCAL DATA HAVEBEEN FORMULATED IN MANY LIBRARIES ON THE BASIS OF CATALOGUE CARD APPEARANCE,BUT THE INCREASING USE OF OCLC TAPE PRODUCTS REQUIRES REEXAMINATION OF MANY OFTHE LOCAL DATA PRACTICES NOW IN USE. A SURVEY WAS CONDUCTED BY THEBIBLIOGRAPHICAL CENTER FOR RESEARCH IN ORDER TO DETERMINE THE EXTENT OFVARIATIONS FOR ENTERING LOCAL DATA ON THE PART OF BCR OCLC LIBRARIES. THERESULTS ARE PRESENTED HERE, ALONG WITH A DISCUSSION OF ALTERNATIVE PRACTICESAND THEIR IMPACT ON THE PROCESSING OF OCLC TAPES.

4345|AUTHORS AND NAMES' MULTIPLE PSEUDONYMS IN AACR2|.     THE HISTORY OF CATALOGUING PSEUDONYMS IS REVIEWED. AACR2| REVERSES ACENTURY-LONG CATALOGUING PRACTICE BY ALLOWING AUTHORS WHO USE SEVERALPSEUDONYMS TO BE ENTERED IN THE CATALOGUE UNDER EACH NAME. THIS VIOLATES THECATALOGUE'S OBJECTIVES AS FORMULATED BY LUBETZKY AND IS CONTRADICTORY TOAACR2|'S OWN INTERNAL LOGIC. THE NUMBER OF DISADVANTAGES TO THIS RULE FAROUTWEIGH ANY ADVANTAGES. IT SHOULD BE REPLACED.
4346|REMARKS ON THE PRE-PRINT OF RAK-WB.     THE RAK-WB (REGELN FUR DIE ALPHABETISCHE KATALOGISIERUNG IN'WISSENSCHAFTLICHEN BIBLIOTHEKEN')-RULES FOR ALPHABETICAL CATALOGUING INRESEARCH LIBRARIES-HAVE BEEN COMPILED TO CORRESPOND TO THE SPECIFIC SITUATIONIN RESEARCH LIBRARIES AND FULFIL THEIR PURPOSE WHICH IS TO BRIDGE THE TIME GAPUNTIL RAK IS PUBLISHED IN BOOK FORM.

THE DURATION OF UNDERGRADUATECOURSES HAS BEEN REDUCED FROM 5| TO 4| YEARS. IT WILL CONCENTRATE ONLIBRARIANSHIP AND/OR INFORMATION SCIENCE AS WELL AS ON CLOSELY RELATEDSUBJECTS. THE AIM OF EQUIPPING STUDENTS WITH THE BASIC KNOWLEDGE IN THE FIELDOF THEIR PROSPECTIVE TYPE OF LIBRARY HAS BEEN ABANDONED. ALTHOUGH IT FELLSHORT OF EXPECTATIONS, THE EXTENSION OF THE DEPARTMENT'S BUILDING WILLNEVERTHELESS ENABLE THE TEACHING AND OTHER STAFF TO BUILD UP RESOURCES OFAUDIO-VISUAL AIDS AND OTHER ILLUSTRATIVE MATERIALS,  AND ALSO TO INVOLVE THEIRSTUDENTS IN RESEARCH PROJECTS.
4483|NEW ERA OF THE SCHOOL OF LIBRARIANSHIP IN BRATISLAVA.     THE SCHOOL OF LIBRARIANSHIP IN BRATISLAVA WAS FOUNDED IN 1953|, SIMULTANEOUSLYWITH SIMILAR SCHOOLS IN PRAGUE AND BRNO.

SINCE 1976|, THESAID CONCEPT HAS ENJOYED OFFICIAL BACKING BY REGULATIONS ISSUED BY THE SLOVAKMINISTRY OF CULTURE. THE REGULATIONS ARE BINDING ON ALL CENTRAL AND OTHERMAJOR LIBRARIES. SO FAR, THE MOST IMPORTANT TRAINING PROJECTS HAVE BEENLAUNCHED BY MATICA SLOVENSKA AND BY THE SLOVAK TECHNICAL LIBRARY. IN-SERVICECOURSES SHOULD NOT ONLY INCLUDE LECTURES, BUT ALSO WORK IN SEMINARS ANDSMALLER GROUPS. VISITS TO SELECTED LIBRARIES AND DISCUSSIONS WITH THEIR STAFFSTIMULATE THE EXCHANGE OF VIEWS AND IDEAS. FILMS AND OTHER ILLUSTRATIVEMATERIALS MUST BE USED MORE FULLY. GRADUATES, CONTINUING THEIR STUDIES ABROAD,MUST BE ENCOURAGED TO CONCENTRATE ON TOPICAL PROBLE MS, AND TO AIM AT POSTSWITH RESPONSIBILITY. USERS OF LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SERVICES HAVE TO BEEDUCATED AND TRAINED, TOO, TO MAKE THE BEST OF THE RESOURCES AVAILABLE.STARTING WITH UNDERGRADUATES, THE SCHEME MUST BE EXPANDED TO INVOLVE THE WHOLENATION IN FUTURE.

EVEN PROFESSIONAL LIBRARIANS WITH 10|, 15| AND MORE YEARS OFSERVICE WERE NOT EXCLUDED FROM THEORETICAL, CONTROVERSIAL AND/OR INNOVATIVETHEMES. THEY ALSO WIDELY EXPLORED SOVIET PERIODICALS AND LITERATURE INRUSSIAN. THE ATTITUDE AND RESPONSE OF BEGINNERS AND SOME LIBRARY ASSISTANTSAPPEARED TO BE LESS ENTERPRISING AND ENTHUSIASTIC, IN SOME CASES EVEN FORMAL.IT IS HOPED, HOWEVER, THAT THEIR PROFESSIONAL ETHICS WILL IMPROVE IN FUTURE.REGULAR MEETINGS WITH THEIR TUTORS, RESULTING IN THE INEVITABLE EXCHANGE OFVIEWS AND OPINIONS WERE OF BENEFICIAL INFLUENCE IN THE STUDY. A POSITIVEEVALUATION OF THE SCHEME MUST BE FOLLOWED BY FURTHER EXPERIMENTATION,SEARCHING AND STRIVING FOR IMPROVE MENT.

THIS IS ATTRIBUTED TO THE INDIFFERENCE OFTHE PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATIONS IN BOTH THE FIELDS OF LIBRARIANSHIP AND HISTORY,THE 2| MAIN DISCIPLINES FROM WHICH MANUSCRIPT LIBRARIANS AND ARCHIVISTS AREDRAWN. BETWEEN 1937|-40| AND 1967|-70|, THE AMERICAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION BECAMEPERIPHERALLY INTERESTED. THE HISTORY PROFESSION HAS BECOME MORE ACTIVE SINCETHE EARLY 1970|S IN ITS SEARCH FOR ALTERNATIVE CAREERS FOR ASPIRING HISTORIANS.INDIVIDUAL LIBRARY SCHOOLS ALSO HAVE BEEN OFFERING ARCHIVAL MANAGEMENT COURSESSINCE THE EARLY 1960|S PARTICULARLY. BY LACKING ACADEMIC STATUS, THE AMERICANLITERATURE IN THE ARCHIVAL FIELD HAS ALSO BEEN UNDERDEVELOPED, AND THIS HASCONTRIBUTED TO THE SLOWNESS IN DEVELOPING ADEQUATE INTELLECTUAL CONTROL OFARCHIVAL/MANUSCRIPT SOURCES. AN ATTEMPT IN 1967|-70| TO DEVELOP AN ARCHIVALMANUAL WITHI N A.L.A. DIED ABORNING AND THE HISTORICAL ASSOCIATIONS ANDSOCIETY OF AMERICAN ARCHIVISTS HAVE JUST BEGUN TO COPE WITH THE PROBLEMINDEPENDENTLY. PRACTICING ARCHIVISTS OF NECESSITY WILL CONTINUE TO BE THE MAINTEACHER POOL AND CONTRIBUTORS TO THE LITERATURE UNTIL REGULAR FACULTY INLIBRARY SCHOOLS AND HISTORY DEPARTMENTS HAVE BEEN ADEQUATELY TRAINED, BUT 1|STA BASIC REORIENTATION MUST OCCUR THAT RECOGNISES THAT RECORDS AND PAPERS OFCONTEMPORARY SOCIETY ARE THE CENTRAL PROBLEM.
