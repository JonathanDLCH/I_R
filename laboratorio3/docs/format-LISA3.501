THE AREAS FOR RESEARCH ARE'LIBRARIES AND INFORMATION SERVICES IN SOCIETY; PRODUCTION OF INFORMATION ANDITS USERS; STORAGE SYSTEMS; AND ADMINISTRATION AND PLANNING. THESE TEND TO BELIBRARY ORIENTED RATHER THAN USER/COMMUNITY ORIENTED. FUTURE PROGRAMMES SHOULDIDENTIFY PROBLEMS NOT OFFER SOLUTIONS. PERHAPS IT WOULD BE MOST FRUITFUL TOSEE LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SCIENCE AS A PART OF SOCIOLOGY. THE NEW POST OFASSISTANT PROFESSOR IN THE DEPARTMENT AT THE UNIVERSITY SHOULD ALSO HAVE THERESPONSIBILITY FOR RESEARCH DEVELOPMENT.

3539|THE NEED FOR LIBRARIES.     THE CONSTRUCTION OF NEW LIBRARY BUILDINGS AS WELL AS THE COMPUTERISATION OFLIBRARY AND INFORMATION SERVICES HAVE BEEN STUDIED BY THE STAFF OF A SPECIALDEPARTMENT AT THE CYRIL AND METHODIUS NATIONAL LIBRARY IN SOFIA. NOW, THE TIMEHAS COME TO ESTABLISH AN INDEPENDENT TECHNICAL CENTRE FOR LIBRARIES, SIMILARTO THE ONE IN PRAGUE, CZECHOSLOVAKIA. AMONG THE CENTRE'S 1|ST AND FOREMOSTCOMMITMENTS SHOULD BE THE COLLECTION OF INFORMATION ON THE CONTEMPORARYWORLDWIDE TRENDS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF LIBRARY BUILDINGS AND THEIR UP-TO-DATEEQUIPMENT. THIS BROAD GENERAL KNOWLEDGE SHOULD BE POOLED FOR THE NEW,SPECIFIED LIBRARY BUILDINGS, AND ALSO FOR THE RECONSTRUCTION, EXTENSION ANDMODERNISATION OF EXISTING LIBRARIES. SUCH ACTIVITIES SHOULD LEAD TO THEESTABLISHMENT OF ARCHIVES OF TECHNICAL DOCUMENTATION AND INDUSTRIAL CATALOGUESFOR THE BENEFIT OF ARCHITECTS, DESIGNERS, LIBRARIANS AND OTHERS.

LECTURE GIVEN AT THE 10|TH ADVANCED TRAINING SEMINAR FOR LIBRARIANS AT THEHERZOG AUGUST LIBRARY IN WOLFENBUTTEL, FEB 81|. FOR YEARS LIBRARIANS HAVEARGUED OVER THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN PURE LIBRARIANSHIP AND ADMINISTRATION INTHEIR WORK, WHICH ARE PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT WHEN ALLOTTING TASKS TO THEHIGHEST STAFF GRADES. LIBRARIANS FEEL THEMSELVES TO BE INADEQUATELYREPRESENTED WHEN QUESTIONS ON UNIVERSITY STAFFING ARISE AND SHOULD STRIVE FORBETTER COORDINATION. ADMINISTRATION IS NOT PART OF THE ACADEMIC DISCIPLINE OFLIBRARIANSHIP AND CLOSE LINKS MUST BE ESTABLISHED BETWEEN THIS DISCIPLINE ANDTHE ACADEMIC LIBRARIAN. ADMINISTRATIVE AND PROFESSIONAL DUTIES FOR THE HIGHESTSTAFF GRADES, ESPECIALLY FOR HEADS OF SUBJECT DEPARTMENTS, MUST BE CLEARLYDEFINED.
3542|POLITICS, LIBRARIES AND UAP.     THE FIRST ISSUE OF 2|SLJ' SOCIALIST LIBRARIANS JOURNAL1| CLAIMS THAT THERE IS ANEED FOR AN INTERNATIONAL FORUM ON LIBRARIANSHIP FROM A SOCIALIST VIEWPOINT,BUT FAILS TO EXPLAIN THE BASIC TENETS OF SOCIALIST LIBRARIANSHIP. REVIEWS SOMEOF THE RECENT LITERATURE ON THIS TOPIC, AND SUGGESTS THAT LIBRARIES MUST,THROUGH FREE ACCESS AND UAP (UNIVERSAL AVAILABILITY OF PUBLICATIONS), ALLOWEVERY THINKING PERSON TO BE ABLE TO FORM HIS OR HER OWN OPINION OF THE WORLDAND THE SOCIETY ROUND THEM. WHILST 2|SLJ1| LACKS INGENUITY AND IS OFTENINCOMPREHENSIBLE, IT ALSO FAILS TO INDICATE THAT SOCIALISM MUST REQUIRE ASOLID PHILOSOPHICAL AND POLITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE.
3543|DO LIBRARIANS FEAR PROFESSIONALISM?.     PAPER PRESENTED AT THE NATIONAL LIBRARIANS ASSOCIATION-SPONSORED PROGRAMME ATTHE MICHIGAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION, 11| OCT 80|. ARGUES THAT IN THE USA LIBRARIANSHAVE BEEN UNABLE TO ACHIEVE THE DISTINCTIVE STATUS OF A PROFESSION. THEY HAVENO WAY OF MAKING THE CLAIM STICK THAT THEY HAVE CRUCIAL SKILLS AND KNOWLEDGEOF VITAL IMPORTANCE TO SOCIETY. AS A RESULT THEY ARE AN OCCUPATIONAL GROUPUNABLE TO INCREASE SIGNIFICANTLY THE ECONOMIC WELL BEING AND PRESTIGE OFLIBRARIANSHIP THROUGH TRADITIONAL PROFESSIONAL MEANS. BECAUSE OF LIBRARYASSOCIATIONS' EMPHASIS ON THE INSTITUTION, THERE IS A LACK OF CONCENTRATION ONWHAT CONSTITUTES THE PROFESSIONAL BASIS FOR LIBRARIANSHIP; THE ASSOCIATIONSHAVE CREATED A SITUATION WHERE THE LIBRARIAN HAS OCCUPATIONAL POWER WITHOUTTHE GROWING SOCIAL PROBLEMS OF PROFESSIONAL POWER.

3547|QUANTITATIVE AND SEMANTIC ASPECTS OF THE CONCEPTION OF INFORMATION.     COMPARES THE MEANINGS OF THE SEMANTIC INFORMATION QUANTITY UNIT AND SHANNON'SINFORMATION QUANTITY UNIT AND THE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH THEY CAN BE USED.CONCLUDES THAT THE FORMER CAN BE A MEANS OF CALCULATING THE DEGREE OFINFORMATION ADEQUACY AND DOES NOT EXHAUST ALL METHODS OF INFORMATIONMEASUREMENT. IF ONE PASSES FROM THE TASK OF INFORMATION TRANSFER TO THAT OFINFORMATION STORAGE, THE CONCEPT OF INFORMATION QUANTITY BECOMES THE CONCEPTOF INFORMATION VOLUME.

FROM 1974|-79|, SECTIONS OF POLITICAL LITERATURE IN 312| SELECTED PUBLIC, TRADEUNION AND SCHOOL LIBRARIES IN THE RUSE REGION WERE THE SUBJECT OF ACOMPREHENSIVE INVESTIGATION. 2|,018| READERS COMPLETED QUESTIONNAIRES AND 191|WERE INTERVIEWED. THE PROPORTION OF POLITICAL LITERATURE IN THE TOTAL BOOKCOLLECTIONS IS ON AVERAGE 20|%. THE PEOPLE WHO STUDY POLITICAL LITERATURE AREPREDOMINANTLY STUDENTS OR PUPILS. REGRETTABLY, ONLY 31|.7|% OF THE READERS USEDLIBRARIES AS A SOURCE OF INFORMATION FOR THEIR NECESSARY LITERATURE. MASSMEDIA AND EDUCATIONAL ESTABLISHMENTS PLAY A MUCH GREATER PART IN THIS RESPECT.THE DESIRABLE TURNOVER OF POLITICAL LITERATURE, THE OPTIMUM NUMBER OF COPIES,AND THE DISCARDING OF OBSOLETE BOOKS ARE ALSO COVERED. ON THE WHOLE, THELIBRARY SERVICE IS PERFORMING A VALUABLE ROLE IN POLITICAL EDUCATION, BUT EVENSO, THERE IS LITTLE ROOM FOR COMPLACENCY.
3660|ARCHIVAL RESOURCES ON LABOUR RELATIONS IN THE UNIVERSITE LAVAL ARCHIVEDIVISION.     DESCRIBES 11| ARCHIVE COLLECTIONS ON LABOUR RELATIONS AT LAVAL UNIVERSITY, INTHE CONTEXT OF GENERAL DISCUSSION OF THE ARCHIVE DIVISION'S POLICY OFESTABLISHING HOLDINGS OF SIGNIFICANT DOCUMENTS RELATING TO QUEBEC IN THISFIELD, AND PROCEDURES FOR ACQUISITION. FOR EACH COLLECTION, TECHNICAL DETAILSARE GIVEN, A BRIEF SKETCH OF THE PERSONS OR GROUPS INVOLVED, AND A SUMMARY OFTHE CONTENTS. HOLDINGS INCLUDE ORIGINAL DOCUMENTS FROM TRADE UNIONS, PROMINENTTRADE UNIONISTS, AND PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATIONS.
3661|AN UNUSUAL SUBJECT LIBRARY.     DESCRIBES A BIOLOGY LIBRARY FOR SENIOR PUPILS IN A GRAMMAR SCHOOL. THE LIBRARYIS OPEN ALL MORNING; PUPILS MAY COME IN FREELY TO STUDY, BORROW BOOKS ANDPHOTOCOPIES AND EXAMINE SPECIMENS. THEY CAN MAKE COFFEE THERE AND CHAT TOTHEIR FRIENDS. ALTHOUGH THE PUPILS THEMSELVES ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ISSUES, VERYFEW BOOKS HAVE BEEN LOST. THERE ARE ABOUT 500| BOOKS, INCLUDING REFERENCE BOOKSAND TEXTBOOKS, FREQUENTLY WITH MULTIPLE COPIES. IN 1979|-80|, 150| SENIOR PUPILSBORROWED, ON AVERAGE, 4| BOOKS EACH. GENERAL SCHOOL LIBRARIES SHOULD BE DIVIDEDINTO SUBJECT LIBRARIES RUN BY DEPARTMENTAL HEADS. THESE LIBRARIES SHOULD BESMALL, CLEARLY ARRANGED AND FREELY ACCESSIBLE.
3662|ENERGY INFORMATION ADMINISTRATION MICROFICHE.     THE DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY'S ENERGY INFORMATION ADMINISTRATION HAS BEEN MAKINGAVAILABLE IN MICROFICHE ITS RETROSPECTIVE COLLECTION OF ENERGY-RELATEDPUBLICATIONS. AS AN AID TO ACCESSING THESE DOCUMENTS, THE AUTHOR HAS COMPILEDA LIST CORRELATING EIA REPORT NUMBERS TO THEIR SUDOCS CLASSIFICATION AND2|AMERICAN STATISTICS INDEX 1|ACCESSION NUMBERS.
3663|ART TO THE PEOPLE.     ARGUES THAT LIBRARIES HAVE AN IMPORTANT ROLE TO PLAY IN MAKING THE PUBLICFAMILIAR WITH ART. THE 1964| DANISH LIBRARY ACT MADE IT POSSIBLE TO DEVELOP ARTDEPARTMENTS AND SEVERAL LARGER LIBRARIES TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THIS, LENDINGMOSTLY PRINTS, POSTERS AND SLIDES. THIS DEVELOPMENT HAS NOW STAGNATED OWING TOVARIOUS MISCONCEPTIONS. THUS ART NEED NOT BE PLACED IN SPECIAL BUILDINGS ONLYVISITED BY HIGHLY MOTIVATED PEOPLE. A LIBRARY SHOULD BEGIN BY LENDING POSTERS,WHICH ARE EASY TO HANDLE, AND THEN PROCEED TO PRINTS. ART NEED NOT BEEXPENSIVE, A POSTER COSTING NO MORE THAN A BOOK, AND LARGE COLLECTIONS ARE NOTNECESSARY. WHEREAS ACQUISITION OF POSTERS IS SIMPLE, PRINTS AND SLIDES DEMANDMORE ATTENTION AS CENTRAL AIDS TO SELECTION OF MATERIAL ARE LACKING.EXHIBITIONS ARE IMPORTANT FOR WIDENING PEOPLE'S CONCEPTION OF ART. REGRETSTHAT THE NEW DANISH LIBRARY BILL OMITS ANY MENTION OF ART.
3664|MUSIC JOURNALS IN THE LIBRARY.     MUSIC, AS A TOPIC OF SPECIAL INTEREST IN JOURNAL LITERATURE, IS DISCUSSEDHISTORICALLY, DESCRIPTIVELY, AND BIBLIOGRAPHICALLY. THE BROAD RANGE OF TITLESREFLECTS THE CONCERNS OF AMATEURS AS WELL AS PROFESSIONALS, AND SELECTEDSOURCES FOR INFORMATION AND EVALUATION ARE PROVIDED TO ASSIST LIBRARIANS INSELECTING APPROPRIATE JOURNALS FOR THEIR PARTICULAR COMMUNITIES OF USERS.
3665|HISTORICAL RESEARCH. A GUIDE TO SELECTED LIBRARY INFORMATION AT THE UNIVERSITYOF TENNESSEE, KNOXVILLE.     ORIENTED TOWARD THE HISTORICAL RESEARCHER, THIS GUIDE SELECTIVELY INTRODUCESMAJOR AVAILABLE USA, UK AND WEST EUROPEAN RESOURCES. ANNOTATED FOR USEFULNESSAND CONTENT, THESE MATERIALS ARE BROADLY ORGANISED IN CATEGORIES ACCORDING TOTHE TYPE OF INFORMATION THEY PROVIDE. INCLUDED ARE RESEARCH GUIDES;ENCYCLOPEDIAS, DICTIONARIES, AND TABLES; BIBLIOGRAPHIES; INDEXES ANDABSTRACTS; BIOGRAPHICAL SOURCES; STATISTICS; NATIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHIES; BOOKREVIEWS; DISSERTATIONS; ATLASES AND GAZETTEERS; PORTRAITS AND PICTORIALSOURCES; GUIDES TO LIBRARIES, ARCHIVES, AND MANUSCRIPTS; GOVERNMENTPUBLICATIONS; AND AN AUTHOR TITLE INDEX. REPORT NOT AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
3666|ARABIC PALEOGRAPHY (IN ARABIC).     DISCUSSES THE USES OF PALEOGRAPHY AND THE SOURCES OF ARABIC PALEOGRAPHY WHICHINCLUDE' OLD COPIES OF THE KOR'AN; PAPYRUS LEAVES; MEMORIAL INSCRIPTIONS; OLDTOMBS; OLD COINS AND DRESSES; WOOD, CLAY, POTS AND RINGS; LETTERS AND WRITINGSON THE DEVELOPMENT OF ARABIC PALEOGRAPHY; SOME OF THE CLASSIC BOOKS ABOUT IT;AND THE SCHOOLS OF ISLAMIC PALEOGRAPHY. ITS ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES, ANDTHE DEVELOPMENT OF ARAB LETTER PRINTING ARE DISCUSSED.
3667|RECENT DOCUMENTATION FOR THE STUDY OF THE SECOND WORLD WAR.     IN RECENT YEARS MUCH CAPTURED OR PREVIOUSLY CLASSIFIED GOVERNMENT INFORMATIONABOUT THE SECOND WORLD WAR AND THE PRE- AND POST-WAR YEARS HAS BEEN PUBLISHEDIN MICROFORMAT. PRESENTS A DESCRIPTIVE, SELECTED SURVEY OF THESE MAJORDOCUMENTS AND GROUPS OF RECORDS NOW AVAILABLE.
3668|THE LIBRARY'S ADMINISTRATIVE BODY: CLEAR GUIDELINES NOW!.     THE NORWEGIAN GOVERNMENT ENVISAGES CULTURAL COMMITTEES AS ADMINISTERINGLIBRARIES. INDIVIDUAL LIBRARY COMMITTEES MAY SURVIVE, BUT AS EXCEPTIONS AND INCONFLICT WITH OFFICIAL POLICY. THE LIBRARY SUB-COMMITTEE IS UNSATISFACTORY. AMINISTRY OF CHURCH AND EDUCATION DOCUMENT (1979|) OUTLINES DIVISION OFRESPONSIBILITY BETWEEN LIBRARIAN AND CULTURAL ADMINISTRATION. LIBRARIANS MUSTINSIST ON SEVERAL PROFESSIONAL DEMANDS. IF THESE STIPULATIONS ARE UPHELD, ANDGUIDELINES DRAWN UP WITH THE SUPPORT OF LIBRARY ORGANISATIONS, LIBRARIES MAYSURVIVE.
3669|THE INTEGRATED LIBRARY SYSTEM OF THE FUTURE.     PRESENT-DAY LIBRARIES AND LIBRARIANS FACE SERIOUS PROBLEMS OF ECONOMICS,POLITICS, AND TECHNOLOGY. ADEQUATE FUNDING IS IN SHORT SUPPLY WHILE LIBRARIANSDO NOT ACT EFFECTIVELY IN THE POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT, AND TECHNOLOGY THREATENSTO LEAD LIBRARIANS RATHER THAN FOLLOW. USING THE ANALOGY OF A BUSINESS OFFICE,THE AUTHOR PROPOSES AN INTEGRATED LIBRARY SYSTEM OF THE FUTURE WITH 3|COMPONENTS; THE LIBRARY, THE JOB, AND THE HOME.
3670|THE DEVELOPMENT OF LIBRARIES AND NETWORKS' PROSPECTIVE ROLES ANDRESPONSIBILITIES FOR LIBRARIES IN NEW JERSEY. 19|TH REPORT.     THE COMMISSION CONCLUDE THAT A REVISION OF LIBRARY LAWS AND AID PROGRAMMES INNEW JERSEY IS NECESSARY TO COMBAT THE EFFECTS OF INFLATION, GROWTH OFINFORMATION AND TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE ON THE ABILITY OF PUBLICLY-SUPPORTEDLIBRARIES TO FULFIL THEIR ROLES IN SOCIETY.
3671|ELEMENTS TO BE INCORPORATED IN LIBRARY NETWORK LEGISLATION.     DRAFTED BY THE NEW JERSEY STATE LIBRARY, THIS LEGISLATIVE PROPOSAL PRESENTSDETAILED PROVISIONS FOR THE GOVERNANCE AND SUPPORT OF A STATE LIBRARY NETWORK.IT CREATES A HIERARCHICAL NETWORKING STRUCTURE TO INCLUDE LIBRARIES OF ALLTYPES, DEFINES SERVICES AND PROGRAMMES TO BE ADMINISTERED, AND ESTABLISHESADMINISTRATIVE AND FUNDING MECHANISMS. ADDITIONAL PROPOSED LEGISLATION ISOUTLINED WHICH REFLECTS THE CONCERNS OF COUNTY LIBRARIES, PUBLIC LIBRARIES,AND REGIONAL FILM CENTRES, AND INCLUDES THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A STATEWIDERECIPROCAL BORROWING PROGRAMME. REPORT NOT AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
3672|PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN LOCAL COOPERATIVE SYSTEMS.     DEALS WITH NETWORKING AND ITS IMPLICATIONS FOR MEMBER LIBRARIES OF ACOOPERATIVE SYSTEM IN NEW YORK STATE. AFTER DESCRIBING BRIEFLY LIBRARYDEVELOPMENTS IN THE STATE, DISCUSSES THE HISTORY, ORGANISATION, AND FINANCINGOF THE NASSAU LIBRARY SYSTEM. THE SERVICE PROGRAMME OF THE SYSTEM IS OUTLINED,AND THESE ACTIVITIES ARE THEN RELATED TO STATEWIDE, REGIONAL, BICOUNTY, ANDLOCAL ACTIVITIES WHICH HAVE AN IMPACT ON LOCAL LIBRARY SERVICE. THE PROBLEMSOF NEW YORK SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT ARE MENTIONED, AND THE BENEFITS OFPARTICIPATION IN A SYSTEM PROGRAMME ARE DISCUSSED.
3673|PUBLIC LIBRARIES AND NETWORKING' A BIBLIOGRAPHIC ESSAY.     MOST OF THE LITERATURE ON THE PARTICIPATION OF PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN COOPERATIVEACTIVITIES DEALS WITH THEIR EXPANSION FROM LOCAL ENTITIES TO MULTITYPESYSTEMS. WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THIS EVOLUTION, TOPICS OF SPECIAL INTERESTHAVE BEEN' APPROPRIATE UNITS OF SERVICE; LEGAL AND POLITICAL CONSIDERATIONS;STIMULUS OF LEGISLATION; ROLE OF STATE LIBRARY AGENCIES; FINANCIAL ASPECTS;HUMAN FACTORS; AND AUTOMATION IN NETWORKING. THE LITERATURE REVIEWED WAS VASTBUT WAS DEFICIENT IN COMPREHENSIVE SYNTHESES, IN RIGOROUS, LARGE-SCALEEVALUATION OF NETWORKING, AND IN STUDIES FOCUSING SOLELY ON PUBLIC LIBRARIES.
3674|POLITICS OF LOCAL INTERLIBRARY COOPERATION.     SOCIAL AND POLITICAL ISSUES ARE KEY FACTORS IN DEVELOPING COOPERATION AMONG USPUBLIC LIBRARIES. EXPERIENCES IN PUBLIC LIBRARY COOPERATION HAVE SHOWN THATTHE ACCEPTANCE OF COOPERATION AS AN IDEAL, PATRON REACTION AND ACCEPTANCE,LOCAL PRIDE AND CONTROL, AND THE EDUCATION AND COOPERATION OF THE LIBRARYBOARD, LOCAL GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, AND FUNDING AGENCIES ARE ALL IMPORTANT INPROVIDING THE BEST POSSIBLE FRAMEWORK FOR COOPERATION. THE COMMITMENT TO ANDUNDERSTANDING OF THE IMPLICATIONS, CHANGES, AND MODIFICATIONS THAT COOPERATIONREQUIRES ARE ALSO IMPORTANT. REALISATION THAT INTERPRETATION OF WHATCOOPERATION MEANS AND THAT UNEQUAL CONTRIBUTIONS CAN BE EXPECTED ARE NECESSARYSTEPS IN DEVELOPING EFFECTIVE ARRANGEMENTS AMONG PUBLIC LIBRARIES.
3675|PUBLIC LIBRARY NETWORKING VIEWED FROM A STATE LIBRARY AGENCY.     ESPECIALLY OVER THE PAST 30| YEARS, US STATE LIBRARY AGENCIES HAVE PLAYED AMAJOR ROLE IN THE PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT OF COOPERATIVE AND NETWORKINGACTIVITIES AMONG PUBLIC LIBRARIES AND BETWEEN PUBLIC LIBRARIES AND OTHER TYPESOF LIBRARIES. THESE ACTIVITIES HAVE BEEN CARRIED OUT IN A GREAT VARIETY OFWAYS, WITH EACH STATE REACTING TO ITS OWN DEMOGRAPHIC, GOVERNMENTAL, ANDLIBRARY REALITIES. THE FEDERAL LIBRARY SERVICES AND CONSTRUCTION ACT HAS BEENA MAJOR CONSTRUCTIVE FORCE ENABLING STATE LIBRARY AGENCIES TO BE EFFECTIVELEADERS IN COOPERATIVE AND NETWORKING ACTIVITIES. STATE LIBRARY AGENCIES ANDPUBLIC LIBRARIES WORKING TOGETHER CAN CONTINUE TO EXTEND LIBRARY SERVICES BYTAKING LEADERSHIP IN NETWORKING ACTIVITIES.
3676|SCHOOL/PUBLIC LIBRARY COOPERATION. A STATE OF THE ART REVIEW.     THIS REVIEW IS PRESENTED AS A RESPONSE TO MAJOR QUESTIONS RELATED TO SCHOOLAND PUBLIC LIBRARY COOPERATION. ITS SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES ARE TO' (1|) INDICATETHE PRESENT STATUS OF COOPERATION BETWEEN SCHOOL AND PUBLIC LIBRARIES; (2|)PRESENT A HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE WITHIN WHICH TO EVALUATE THE PROGRESS OFCURRENT EFFORTS; (3|) IDENTIFY FUTURE TRENDS AND DIRECTIONS; (4|) POINT OUTBARRIERS TO COOPERATION AND FACTORS LEADING TO ITS SUCCESS; (5|) SUGGESTOUTSTANDING SOURCES WHICH CONTAIN RELEVANT INSIGHTS ABOUT SCHOOL/PUBLICLIBRARY COOPERATION; AND (6|) IDENTIFY SOME REPRESENTATIVE COOPERATIVEACTIVITIES. REPORT NOT AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
3677|THE AMALGAMATION OF A SMALL AND A LARGER LIBRARY.     IN THE NETHERLANDS THE PUBLIC LIBRARY AUTHORITY OF VLAGTEWEDDE, WHICH WITH APOPULATION OF 16|,500| INHABITANTS WOULD HAVE BEEN COMPELLED UNDER THE DUTCHPUBLIC LIBRARY ACT TO SURRENDER ITS LIBRARY SERVICE TO THE COUNTY COUNCIL,COMBINED IN 1978| WITH THE NEARBY TOWN OF STADSKANAAL WITH A POPULATION OF34|,000| TO PROVIDE A JOINT LIBRARY SERVICE. THE COMBINED LIBRARY SERVICE NOWHAS ITS MAIN LIBRARY AT STADSKANAAL, 5| BRANCH LIBRARIES AND A MOBILE LIBRARYWITH A TOTAL COLLECTION OF APPROXIMATELY 135|,000| BOOKS AND RECORDS. THERE ARE16|,600| REGISTERED BORROWERS AND LOANS IN 1980| TOTALLED 750|,000|. LIBRARYSERVICES THROUGHOUT THE REGION HAVE BEEN IMPROVED BY THE CREATION OFDOCUMENTATION CENTRES IN SCHOOLS AND BY THE SETTING UP OF A LIBRARY SERVICEFOR HOUSEBOUND READERS.
3678|ON THE EDGE OF THE DESERT' STATEMENT OF ACHIEVEMENTS BY THE PUBLIC LIBRARIES.     THE IDEA THAT INCREASES IN LOANS AND STOCKS WOULD BRING ABOUT PROPORTIONALINCREASES IN FINANCE, ACCOMMODATION AND STAFF HAS PROVED INCORRECT. STATISTICSON LOANS AND STOCKS CONCEAL WEAKNESSES WITHIN A LIBRARY AND THE UNFULFILLEDWISHES OF READERS. THERE IS NO PROSPECT AT PRESENT OF A LIBRARY LAW AND SALARYNEGOTIATIONS HAVE STOPPED. ONLY 10|% OF THE POPULATION USE LIBRARIES' MOREDEDICATED LIBRARIANS ARE NEEDED TO DEVELOP SOCIAL LIBRARIANSHIP. FREEDOM INBOOK SELECTION IS OFTEN THREATENED BY THE ATTITUDE OF LOCAL OFFICIALS AND BYCONDITIONS ON THE BOOK MARKET. PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN GERMANY HAVE DEVELOPED NOTIN A UNIFIED FASHION BUT THROUGH A VARIETY OF HISTORICAL CAUSES. THE BEST CUREOF THESE PROBLEMS WOULD BE AN OPEN AND CRITICAL DIALOGUE BETWEEN LIBRARIANSAND POLITICIANS.
3679|THE FUTURE DEVELOPMENT OF LIBRARIES AND INFORMATION SERVICES.     CONTAINS 2| REPORTS ON THE FUTURE DEVELOPMENT OF LIBRARIES AND INFORMATIONSERVICES; 'THE ORGANISATIONAL AND POLICY FRAMEWORK' AND 'WORKING TOGETHERWITHIN A NATIONAL FRAMEWORK'. THE FIRST REPORT WAS SUBMITTED TO THE MINISTERFOR THE ARTS IN 1979| AND IS CONCERNED MAINLY WITH LIBRARIES. THE SECOND REPORTWAS SUBMITTED IN 1981| AND IS CONCERNED MAINLY WITH THE APPLICATION OF NEWTECHNOLOGY TO LIBRARIES AND INFORMATION SERVICES AND WITH THE IMPROVEMENT INCOOPERATION AT LOCAL, REGIONAL AND NATIONAL LEVEL.
3680|THE LONG RANGE PLAN FOR STATEWIDE LIBRARY DEVELOPMENT IN CONNECTICUT,1980|-1985|.     PREPARED TO SATISFY REQUIREMENTS OF THE LIBRARY SERVICES AND CONSTRUCTION ACT(LCSA) PL 95|-123|, THIS LONG-RANGE PLAN PRESENTS LIBRARY SERVICE GOALS ANDOBJECTIVES FOR THE CONNECTICUT LIBRARY SYSTEM FOR THE NEXT 5| YEARS. THEBACKGROUND OF LONG RANGE PLANNING, THE PLANNING PROCESS, AND PROBLEMS TO BEOVERCOME ARE DEVELOPED WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF FEDERAL GUIDELINES FORPROGRAMMES AND EXPENSES. REPORT NOT AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
3681|BUILDING THE FUTURE. THE ALABAMA LONG RANGE PROGRAM FOR LIBRARY DEVELOPMENT,1980|-1984|.     BASED PRIMARILY ON IDENTIFIED NEEDS FOR LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SERVICES FORTHE CITIZENS OF ALABAMA, THIS REPORT DISCUSSES LIBRARY AND INFORMATION NEEDSIN THE CONTEXTS OF PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVICES, SPECIAL SERVICES FOR SPECIALCONSTITUENCIES, AND INTERLIBRARY COOPERATION; PROVIDES A DETAILED OUTLINE OFTHE MISSION, GOALS, AND OBJECTIVES OF THE STATE'S PUBLIC LIBRARY SYSTEM; ANDDETAILS THE POLICIES, CRITERIA, PRIORITIES, AND PROCEDURES FOR THE ALLOCATIONOF LIBRARY SERVICES AND CONSTRUCTION ACT (LSCA) FUNDS. REPORT NOT AVAILABLEFROM NTIS.
3682|A FIRE IN THE DEBATE ABOUT THE NEW LIBRARY BILL.     DISCUSSES THE LIBRARY BILL PROPOSED BY THE DANISH CHRISTIAN PEOPLES' PARTY, AMINORITY PARTY WHOSE PROPOSAL HAS NO CHANCE OF BECOMING LAW, BUT MIGHT YETINFLUENCE THE RULING SOCIAL DEMOCRATS' PROPOSAL. THE C.P.P. SUPPORTS THELIBRARY COMMISSION'S MINORITY REPORT AND PREFERS THAT PUBLIC LIBRARIES AREADMINISTERED BY THE MINISTRY OF CULTURAL AFFAIRS, WHILE RESEARCH, EDUCATIONALAND SCHOOL LIBRARIES COME UNDER THE MINISTRY OF EDUCATION. BUT UNLIKE THEMINORITY REPORT, IT SUGGESTS THAT NO NON-BOOK MATERIALS AND CULTURALACTIVITIES SHOULD RECEIVE STATE SUPPORT, AND THAT IT SHOULD BE UP TO THEINDIVIDUAL AUTHORITY WHETHER TO CHARGE FOR THESE OR FINANCE THEM OUT OF THELOCAL RATES. EXEMPTED FROM THIS PROPOSAL SHOULD BE LENDING OF AUDIO-VISUALMATERIALS TO THE DISABLED. IT SUPPORTS THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE LOCAL AUTHORITYAND ITS DECISIVE INFLUENCE ON BOOK SELECTION. A BLOCK GRANT SYSTEM OFFINANCING WOULD ALSO AID LOCAL INDEPENDENCE.
3683|INFLEXIBLE CONTROL SYSTEM.     COMPLAINS OF THE NECESSITY FOR NORWEGIAN BRANCH LIBRARIES TO MAKE SEPARATEANNUAL RETURNS TO SATISFY THE COUNTY LIBRARY AND THE NATIONAL LIBRARY OFFICE.1| COORDINATED REPORT COMPILED BY THE CENTRAL LIBRARY SHOULD BE SUFFICIENT.SEPARATE RETURNS CAN BE POSITIVELY MISLEADING, SINCE, FOR INSTANCE, BOOKSTRANSFERRED OR CIRCULATING WITHIN A LIBRARY SYSTEM CANNOT BE ACCURATELYRECORDED. PUTS FORWARD PROPOSALS TO REDUCE THE TIME SPENT ON STATISTICS; THETYPE REQUIRED TO JUSTIFY THE LIBRARY'S PLACE IN SOCIETY WERE TO BE THERESPONSIBILITY OF A SALARIED COMMITTEE OF LIBRARIANS. BOOKSTOCK STANDARDSWOULD ALSO BE MORE VIABLE IF FORMULATED FOR 1| AUTHORITY, WITH THE NECESSARYDIVISIONS INTO CENTRAL LIBRARY AND BRANCHES. THE STATUS AND FUNCTION OF THECOUNTY LIBRARIANS' CONFERENCE IS QUERIED, AND THE RIGHT OF WORKERS'ORGANISATIONS TO REPRESENTATION ON THE NATIONAL LIBRARY COUNCIL IS STRESSED.
3684|COPYRIGHT AND A RESERVE READING ROOM' FROM MENACE TO OFFICE ROUTINE.     DISCUSSES THE EFFECTS OF THE US COPYRIGHT REVISION ACT OF 1976| ON THE SERVICE,BUDGET EXPENDITURE AND OFFICE PROCEDURES OF THE PENN STATE UNIVERSITY'SLIBRARY RESERVE READING ROOM. DESCRIBES HOW THE LIBRARY, WHICH HELD ACONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF MULTIPLE COPIES OF PHOTOCOPIED MATERIAL DEALT WITH THENEW LAW'S SECTION OF LIBRARY REPRODUCTION. DISCUSSES SOME OF THE SOLUTIONSWHICH WERE FOUND TO THE PROBLEMS CAUSED BY THE ACT, INCLUDING' PURCHASING BACKISSUES, REPRINTS OR ADDITIONAL COPIES OF BOOKS; AND MORE FULLY TAKINGADVANTAGE OF THE UNIVERSAL SERIALS AND BOOK EXCHANGE. INDICATES SOME ISSUESREGARDING THE COPYRIGHT LAW AND RESERVE ROOMS THAT NEED RESOLUTION.
3685|MBO AND THE PUBLIC LIBRARY.     WINDSOR, CONNECTICUT HAS A PUBLIC LIBRARY STAFFED BY 5| PROFESSIONALS AND 10|CLERICAL PERSONNEL. IN 1975|, THE TOWN OF WINDSOR AND THE LIBRARY AS ONE OF ITSDEPARTMENTS, ADOPTED MANAGEMENT BY OBJECTIVES. REVIEWS THE SUCCESSES ANDFAILURES OF MBO IN THE CONTENT OF THE LIBRARY. TASKS AND ACTIVITIES WERE PUTIN WIDE FUNCTIONAL COMPARTMENTS-COLLECTION MANAGEMENT, CIRCULATION MANAGEMENT,LIBRARY PROMOTION, INFORMATION SERVICES, AND EVENTS MANAGEMENT. DESCRIBES THEPROBLEMS INVOLVED IN THE DEVELOPMENT AND EXECUTION OF OBJECTIVES. WHILSTLIBRARY COLLEAGUES HAVE NOT BEEN OVERLY INTERESTED IN MBO, THE RAISING OFIMPORTANT QUESTIONS AND THE ATTEMPTS TO ANSWER THEM MORE THAN JUSTIFIES ALLTHE TOIL THAT MBO HAS REQUIRED.
3686|SOURCES OF FUNDING FOR VIRGINIA LIBRARIES.     THE REPORT IS DESIGNED TO (1|) EDUCATE NON-LIBRARIANS AS TO HOW VIRGINIALIBRARIES ARE FUNDED, (2|) INFORM LIBRARIANS OF FUNDING OUTSIDE THEIRPARTICULAR SPECIALTY, (3|) SUGGEST THE ADEQUACY AND INADEQUACY OF SUCH FUNDINGAND ITS DEPENDABILITY, AND (4|) OUTLINE THE FORMULAS BY WHICH FUNDS AREDISTRIBUTED. REPORT NOT AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
3687|ARE COUNTY LIBRARIES THREATENED?.     THE NORWEGIAN GOVERNMENT REPORT NOU 1979| PROPOSES THAT FROM 1981| STATE GRANTSTOWARDS COUNTY ADMINISTRATION SHOULD CEASE, BEING REPLACED BY ADDITIONAL TAXINCOME. THE INTENTION IS TO SIMPLIFY LOCAL GOVERNMENT FINANCIAL STRUCTURE ANDINCREASE THE COUNTIES' ADMINISTRATIVE RESPONSIBILITY AND AUTONOMY.CONCENTRATING ON TECHNICAL DETAILS, THE REPORT IGNORES THEIR EFFECT ONPROFESSIONS AND EMPLOYMENT IN THE AREAS CONCERNED. CULTURAL WORK IS DEFINED ASA VOLUNTARY ACTIVITY FOR COUNTIES, NOT REQUIRING OR MERITING STATE SUPPORT;LIBRARIES ARE CONSIDERED TO BE ALREADY UNDER SOME DEGREE OF STATE SUPERVISION.STATE SUPPORT HAS BEEN A STIMULUS TO CULTURAL LIFE IN RURAL AREAS, AND ITSREMOVAL WOULD BE A RETROGRADE STEP. THE PROPOSALS, IF IMPLEMENTED WITHOUTFURTHER CLARIFICATION OF LAWS, REGULATIONS AND AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY, COULDLEAD TO GREATLY VARYING STANDARDS OF LIBRARY SERVICE IN INDIVIDUAL COUNTIES,ALSO AFFECTING SCHOOLS AND ADULT EDUCATION. THIS WOULD BE DI RECTLY COUNTER TOTHE 'EQUALITY PRINCIPLE' IN THE CURRENT LIBRARY ACT.
3688|THE ALLOCATION OF STATE FUNDS TO PUBLIC LIBRARY SYSTEMS IN CALIFORNIA.     (DLS THESIS-UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT BERKELEY.) DISCUSSES THE EVOLUTION OFCALIFORNIA'S STATE POLICY REGARDING FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO PUBLIC LIBRARIESWHICH BEGAN WITH THE INVESTIGATIONS BY THE SUBCOMMITTEE ON LIBRARY PROBLEMS OFTHE ASSEMBLY INTERIM COMMITTEE ON EDUCATION FROM 1953|-57|. THIS LED TO THEESTABLISHMENT OF THE CALIFORNIA LIBRARY COMMISSION IN 1957|. TRACES THE WORK OFTHE COMMISSION AND THE EMPHASIS PLACED ON COOPERATION BETWEEN SMALL LIBRARIESIN ORDER TO MAKE MAXIMUM USE OF THE FUNDS AVAILABLE.
3689|PRICING OBJECTIVES FOR PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVICES.     OPPORTUNITIES AND PROBLEMS CONFRONTING A PUBLIC LIBRARY IN ITS PRICINGDECISION ARE RELATED TO ITS PRICING OBJECTIVES. EXAMINES 6| OBJECTIVES OF PRICEAND IDENTIFIES THE LIKELY OUTCOMES ASSOCIATED WITH EACH OBJECTIVE. THESEOBJECTIVES ARE MARKET EQUITY, SOCIAL EQUITY, MAXIMUM OPPORTUNITY FORPARTICIPATION, MAXIMISING REVENUE, RATIONING, AND COMMERCIAL SECTORENCOURAGEMENT. IT IS UNLIKELY THAT A LIBRARY WILL HAVE ONE OVERALL PRICINGOBJECTIVE WHICH IS APPLICABLE TO ALL THE SERVICES IT DELIVERS. THE PRICEULTIMATELY ADOPTED FOR ANY PARTICULAR SERVICE WILL DEPEND ON WHICH OBJECTIVESARE UPPERMOST IN PRIORITY AND WILL REPRESENT THE BEST COMPROMISE AMONGCONFLICTING OBJECTIVES.
3690|SYMPOSIUM ON GOVERNMENT, FINANCE AND LIBRARIES.     MARGARET SKED DISCUSSES THE ROLE OF SCHOOL LIBRARIES AND LIBRARIANS IN THELIGHT OF DEVELOPMENTS IN CURRICULA AND TEACHING METHODS AND CUTS IN LOCALGOVERNMENT EXPENDITURE IN SCOTLAND WHICH ARE HITTING EDUCATION PARTICULARLYHARD. ERIC SIMPSON DISCUSSES THE ROLE OF COLLEGE LIBRARIES AND THE EFFECTS ONTHEIR BUDGETS OF CUTS IN LOCAL AND CENTRAL GOVERNMENT SPENDING. NORMAN TURNERBRIEFLY STRESSES THE NEED TO CONVINCE THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES OF THE VALUE OFPUBLIC LIBRARIES WHEN ALLOTTING FUNDING.
3691|GREAT DIFFERENCES IN THE FINANCIAL POSITION AND LEVEL OF SERVICES OF RESEARCHLIBRARIES.     COMMENTS ON THE SECTIONS OF A REPORT BY THE RESEARCH PLANNING COUNCIL' 2|THECONDITIONS FOR RESEARCH IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR1| WHICH DEAL WITH RESEARCHLIBRARIES. THE CONCLUSION IS THAT THE REDUCTION OF FUNDS AVAILABLE FORACQUISITION OF LITERATURE HAS LED TO SEVERE PROBLEMS FOR RESEARCH. ANALYSIS OFTHE DEVELOPMENT IN THE 1970|S SHOWS INCREASE IN EXPENDITURE ON STAFF AND FALLIN THE REAL VALUE OF THAT FOR ACQUISITIONS, TOGETHER WITH A DOUBLING OFISSUES. THE COMEMNTS ON LIBRARIES ARE SCATTERED THROUGHOUT THE REPORT, BUT CANBE CLASSED AS THOSE THAT MENTION' LIBRARIES WITHOUT PROBLEMS OF ACQUISITION,OR LIBRARIES WHERE PROBLEMS HAVE NOT YET ARISEN, AND LIBRARIES WITHCONSIDERABLE PROBLEMS. ARTS FACULTIES HAVE SEEN AN INCREASE IN SUBJECTS ANDFOREIGN SPECIALISED LITERATURE COINCIDING WITH A DECREASE IN BOOK GRANTS. INTHE NATURAL SCIENCE FACULTIES, INSTITUTE LIBRARIES HAVE BEEN FORCED TO ACQUIREBOOKS WHICH WOULD NORMALLY HAVE BEEN BORROWED FROM A RESEARCH LIBRARY; GAPSARE APPEARING IN RUNS OF PERIODICALS, AND REFERENCE WORKS ARE IN SHORT SUPPLY.SERVICE LEVEL HAS GONE DOWN AS A RESULT OF UNDERMANNING OF LIBRARIES. SOMELIBRARIES, FOR EXAMPLE THOSE OF THE AGRICULTURAL AND THE COMMERCIAL HIGHSCHOOLS, STAND OUT AS PARTICULARLY HARD HIT.
3692|THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CENTRAL AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT' THE LOCAL VIEWPOINT.     DISCUSSES CUTS IN THE BUDGETS FOR LIBRARIES IN SCOTLAND IN THE LIGHT OF THEGOVERNMENT'S CUTS IN PUBLIC SPENDING. ARGUES THAT MORE EFFICIENT AND SLIMMERSERVICES WILL BE NEEDED IN FUTURE WHICH ARE MANNED BY MORE HIGHLY SPECIALISEDAND ADAPTABLE LIBRARIANS WHOSE SERVICES ARE RECOGNISED BY ADEQUATE PAY LEVELS.STRESSES THE NEED FOR STANDARDS FOR SERVICES AND MEANS OF MEASURING LEVELS OFPERFORMANCE.
3693|LONG RANGE BUDGET PLANNING IN LARGE PUBLIC LIBRARIES.     ARGUES THAT IF A LARGE PUBLIC LIBRARY MAKES A PRACTICE OF GATHERINGINFORMATION ON WHICH TO BUILD BUDGET REQUESTS, THE TIME CONSUMING DATAGATHERING CAN BE REDUCED IN SUBSEQUENT YEARS BY EXAMINING THE OVERALLREQUESTED GROWTH RATE FOR THE SYSTEM AND ADJUSTING THE FIGURES WHERE NEEDED TOBRING IT IN LINE WITH WHAT IS FEASIBLE. THE ADJUSTED FIGURES CAN THEN BERETURNED TO THE REQUESTING LIBRARIANS FOR THEM TO SEE WHAT CAN BE EXPECTED ASA REQUEST. DEMONSTRATES HOW, IN TIMES WHEN FUNDS ARE SCARCE, THIS PRACTICEWILL ACT AS AN INFORMATIONAL AND DECISION-MAKING TOOL AND WILL SERVE TO ADJUSTLIBRARY NEEDS TO ZERO-BASE BUDGETING PRACTICES.
3694|WORD PROCESSOR (HERMES WP-6000|) AND ITS APPLICATION TO LIBRARY WORK.     A WORD PROCESSOR, HERMES WP-6000|, WAS INSTALLED IN TOKYO METROPOLITANGERONTOLOGY CENTER LIBRARY IN FEB 80|. DETAILED DESCRIPTIONS ARE PROVIDED FORTHE SYSTEM COMPONENTS, WHICH INCLUDE A CRT DISPLAYER, DISK DRIVE, KEYBOARD, APRINTER AND A FLOPPY DISK. THE LIBRARY APPLICATIONS OF WORD PROCESSORS AREEXPLORED IN THE AREA OF CATALOGUE CARD PRODUCTION, BOOK CATALOGUE PRODUCTION,AND CURRENT FOREIGN SERIAL RECORD MAINTENANCE.
3695|THE USE OF AUTOMATED DATA PROCESSING IN LIBRARIES' IDEAS FOR A NEW VIEWPOINT.     ALTHOUGH LIBRARIANS FORMERLY ADOPTED A DEFENSIVE ATTITUDE WHEN INTRODUCINGAUTOMATED DATA PROCESSING, ITS USE RESULTED IN ERGONOMIC IMPROVEMENTS AND MOREINTERESTING WORK FOR SOME STAFF. THE USE OF AUTOMATED DATA PROCESSING CAN,HOWEVER, CAUSE STRESS AND MONOTONY, THE CONTROL OF WORK AND HUMAN POTENTIAL BYMACHINES, INCREASED ISOLATION OF INDIVIDUALS, THE DOWNGRADING OF SOME LIBRARYPOSTS AND THE LOSS OF A FRIENDLY ATMOSPHERE FOR READERS. IF THE HUMAN TOUCH ISTO BE RETAINED IN LIBRARIES, NEW STANDARDS ARE REQUIRED. GOOD COMMUNICATIONMUST BE DEVELOPED BETWEEN STAFF MEMBERS AND BETWEEN STAFF AND READERS. STAFFWORK MUST BE REORGANISED AND THE TENDENCY TO GIGANTISM IN THE USE OFAUTOMATION AVOIDED.
3696|COMPUTER BASICS FOR LIBRARIANS AND INFORMATION SCIENTISTS.     AN INTRODUCTORY TEXT ON COMPUTERS AND DATA PROCESSING WHICH PROVIDE A BROADOVERVIEW OF THE FIELD, WITH AN EMPHASIS ON THE NEEDS AND INTERESTS OF THELIBRARY AND INFORMATION SCIENCE COMMUNITY. MANY ASPECTS OF COMPUTING SYSTEMSARE DISCUSSED RANGING FROM HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE CONCEPTS TO PERSONNEL ANDDOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS. SECTIONS ON STORAGE CONSIDERATIONS AND PROGRAMMINGLANGUAGES STRESS ISSUES OF PARTICULAR IMPORTANCE IN LIBRARY COMPUTING SYSTEMS.AT THE SAME TIME, SPECIAL ATTENTION HAS BEEN GIVEN TO THOSE TOPICS COMMONLYIGNORED IN BOOKS DEALING WITH LIBRARY AUTOMATION. FOR EXAMPLE, OPERATINGSYSTEMS AND THE INTERNAL METHODS OF COMPUTER MEMORY MANAGEMENT ARE DISCUSSED.
3697|THE EFFECTS OF LIBRARY AUTOMATION ON STAFF AND READERS MUST BE INVESTIGATED.     RESEARCH HAS CONCENTRATED ON THE TECHNICAL ASPECTS OF LIBRARY AUTOMATION ANDNEGLECTED THE SOCIOLOGICAL ASPECTS, SO THAT OPINION ON THE POSITIVE ANDNEGATIVE EFFECTS IS SHARPLY DIVIDED. THE MAIN PURPOSE OF AUTOMATION IS TOINCREASE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF LIBRARY PROCEDURES; SERVICE CHANGES ARE STILLREGARDED AS SIDE-EFFECTS. AUTOMATION'S VALUE MUST BE JUDGED IN TERMS OF THEAVERAGE NON-ACADEMIC READER. THE TIME SAVED FOR STAFF THROUGH AUTOMATION OFROUTINE PROCEDURES MUST BE USED FOR READER-ORIENTED ACTIVITIES, FOR WHICHFURTHER STAFF TRAINING SHOULD BE PROVIDED. THE RESULTS OF EXPERIENCES IN THISFIELD FROM LIBRARIES ABROAD SHOULD BE STUDIED CAREFULLY.
3698|MEDIA CONTROL REPORT WITHOUT PERSPECTIVES.     COMMENTS ON 2|AUTOMATED MEDIA CONTROL IN THE PUBLIC LIBRARY, 1|A JOINT REPORT BYTHE NORWEGIAN ASSOCIATION OF MUNICIPAL LIBRARY WORKERS AND THE COMPUTERCOMMITTEE. THE WORKING PARTY ON PILOT PROJECTS DOES NOT DELINEATE LONG-TERMPERSPECTIVES FOR DEVELOPMENT, MAKING IT DIFFICULT TO SEE ITS PROPOSALS AS PARTOF A WHOLE. THE SWEDISH SITUATION OF 2| SEPARATE DATA SYSTEMS FOR SPECIAL ANDPUBLIC LIBRARIES, RESULTING IN DUPLICATION OF WORK AND UNDER-UTILISEDRESOURCES, MUST BE AVOIDED IN NORWAY; THE REPORT IS CRITICISED FOR NOTCONSIDERING COMPUTER DEVELOPMENT IN PUBLIC AND SPECIAL LIBRARIES TOGETHER. ITALSO FAILS TO SPECIFY THE EFFECTS OF COMPUTERISATION ON LIBRARY STAFFS,BORROWERS AND FINANCE. THE COMMITTEE REGARDS ISSUE CONTROL AS THE ROUTINE MOSTREQUIRING COMPUTERISATION, BUT MANY PUBLIC LIBRARIES HAVE OTHER PRIORITIES,SUCH AS OVERDUE RECALL WORK. EASILY-AMASSED STATISTICS MUST NOT BE ALLOWED TOBUILD UP EXTRA WORK. SEVERAL PARAGRAPHS FROM THE REPORT ARE SELECTED FORDETAILED COMMENT.
3699|COMPUTERS IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES.     A NORWEGIAN COUNTY LIBRARIANS' CONFERENCE (SEPT 80|) DEFINED 2| MAIN PURPOSES OFAUTOMATION' (1|) LIBRARY TECHNOLOGY AND ADMINISTRATIVE ROUTINES; (2|) INDEXING,STORAGE AND RETRIEVAL OF INFORMATION. NORWEGIAN PUBLIC LIBRARIES SHOULDPROBABLY BEGIN WITH ADMINISTRATIVE ROUTINES AND PROCEED GRADUALLY, WHILEDISCUSSING MAJOR LONG-TERM OBJECTIVES, SUCH AS' AN INTEGRATED SYSTEM; ADECENTRALISED SYSTEM UTILISING CENTRAL SERVICES; LIBRARIES NOT USING COMPUTERSTHEMSELVES, BUT LARGELY DEPENDENT ON COMPUTERISED PRODUCTIONS. THE LIBRARYCENTRE WILL EVENTUALLY ACT AS A DATA BASE FOR PUBLIC LIBRARY LITERATURE AND ACENTRE FOR PUBLIC LIBRARY COMPUTER OPERATIONS. LOCAL SYSTEMS ARE VIABLE ONLYFOR THE LARGEST LIBRARIES; SMALL AND MEDIUM-SIZED LIBRARIES MUST BE LINKED TOA CENTRAL AUTHORITY, AND HENCE TO THE RESOURCES OF THE LARGE LIBRARIES. PUBLICLIBRARIES MUST FORMULATE THEIR OWN POLICY FOR AUTOMATION, EVALUATING SYSTEMSACCORDINGLY.
3700|GROUNDS FOR THE AUTOMATION PROPOSAL.     THE NORWEGIAN COMPUTER COMMITTEE WILL PRESENT A REPORT ON COMPUTERISATION IN1982|. THE ASSOCIATION OF MUNICIPAL LIBRARY WORKERS CONSIDERS THAT A DEFINITERULING ON ITS ATTITUDE TO INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IS NEEDED BEFORE THEN.STRESSING THAT IT DOES NOT OPPOSE THE NEW TECHNOLOGY, THAT POTENTIAL USERSMUST TAKE PART IN DEVELOPING THE SYSTEMS, AND THAT STRICT QUALITATIVESTANDARDS ARE NECESSARY, IT PRESENTS A 2|-PART PROPOSAL RELATING TO TRADEUNIONS AND LIBRARY POLICY.
3701|THE ART OF RUNNING A DATA LIBRARY.     DATA TECHNOLOGY HAS APPEARED AT THE RIGHT TIME TO HELP LIBRARIANS WITH THEGREATLY INCREASED WORKLOAD OF RECENT YEARS. RETROSPECTIVE LITERATURE SEARCHINGAND CURRENT LITERATURE AWARENESS, FOR INSTANCE, CAN BENEFIT GREATLY FROMAUTOMATION. FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS ARE LIKELY IN THE FIELDS OF SOCIAL ANDCOMMUNITY INFORMATION SERVICES, FULLER INDEXING TO AID IDENTIFICATION IN THEHUMANITIES, CATALOGUING OF LOCAL COLLECTIONS, AND INDEXING OF AUDIO-VISUALMATERIAL. ALL PUBLIC LIBRARIES SHOULD SET ABOUT INFORMING STAFF AND PUBLIC ONTHE QUESTION OF COMPUTERISATION; THE WORKING PARTY RECENTLY APPOINTED SHOULDINTENSIFY THEIR DISCUSSIONS ON THE SWEDISH BUMS SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT ANDAUTOMATION IN GENERAL; AND CONTACTS SHOULD BE STRENGTHENED ETWEEN CULTURAL ANDLIBRARY ORGANISATIONS WITH A VIEW TO DISCUSSING AUTOMATION IN SWEDISH PUBLICLIBRARIES.
3702|NTL'S COMPUTERISATION WORK AT OSLO UNIVERSITY LIBRARY.     MEMBERS OF NORSK TJENESTEMANNLAG (THE NORWEGIAN ASSOCIATION OF PUBLICSERVANTS) EMPLOYED IN OSLO UNIVERSITY LIBRARY SET UP THEIR OWN GROUP IN1977|-78|, AND ESTABLISHED A WORKING PARTY TO DEFINE THEIR PROFESSIONAL POLICYON COMPUTERISATION. TOPICS HAVE INCLUDED DISCUSSION ON RECENT OFFICIALSTATEMENTS ON THE FRAMEWORK OF DATA SYSTEMS; DISTRIBUTION OF INFORMATION TOSHOP STEWARDS AND EMPLOYEES; TRAINING COURSES; LIAISON OFFICERS; CONTACTMEETINGS; COOPERATION AMONG PROFESSIONAL ORGANISATIONS IN OSLO UNIVERSITYLIBRARY; STATEMENTS ON CONCRETE PROJECTS; DEMANDS REGARDING COMPUTERISATIONDEVELOPMENT; REPRESENTATION ON RELEVANT BODIES; WORKING CONDITIONS AND HOURSAT TERMINALS; NEED FOR SPECIFIC STATEMENTS ON LOCAL DATA SYSTEMS;ADMINISTRATION OF NATIONAL SYSTEMS; AND CONTACT WITH COLLEAGUES IN OTHERLIBRARIES. IN OSLO UNIVERSITY LIBRARY PROGRAMMES OF COMPUTER USE ARE AT ACOMPARATIVELY ADVANCED STAGE OF DEVELOPMENT, SO FAR WITHOUT MAJOR CONSEQUENCES FOR INDIVIDUAL STAFF. THE WORKING PARTY'S EFFORTS HAVE PRODUCEDGUIDELINES ON CERTAIN PROBLEMS, AND CONTRIBUTED TO THE COOPERATIVE BODY OFWORK ON COMPUTERISATION BY PROFESSIONAL LIBRARIANS.
3703|LIBRARY PLANNING FOR FUTURE NETWORKS.     AUTOMATION DEVELOPMENTS OF INDIVIDUAL LIBRARIES ARE VIEWED AS LEADING TOWARDINVOLVEMENT IN NETWORKS. THE PRIMARY ISSUES OF MACHINE-READABLE RECORDFORMATS, HOLDINGS FORMATS MECHANISMS FOR UPDATING MACHINE-READABLE DATA BASES,AND SYSTEM INTERFACES FOR HARDWARE, SOFTWARE, AND OPERATING SYSTEMS NEED TO BEADDRESSED IF THE LOCAL DEVELOPMENTS ARE TO BE A STEP TOWARD THE LIBRARY'SEVENTUAL NETWORKING CAPABILITIES. LIBRARIES AND THE BIBLIOGRAPHIC NETWORKS AREALL PROGRESSING IN THEIR USE OF COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY, BUT NOT NECESSARILYTOWARD A COMMON GOAL.
3704|NETWORK ORGANIZATION' CURRENT STATUS AND CONCERNS.     DESCRIBES THE BASIC ASPECTS OF LIBRARY NETWORK ORGANISATION IN THE USA. PAYSPARTICULAR ATTENTION TO THE ORGANISATIONAL AND GOVERNANCE STRUCTURES THAT HAVEBEEN DEVELOPED BY THESE NETWORKS. BOTH THE STATE AND MULTISTATE NETWORKS ANDTHE 3| MAJOR NATIONAL NETWORK ORGANISATIONS (OCLC, INC., RLG/RLIN, AND WLN) AREDESCRIBED. IN ADDITION, ORGANISATIONAL ISSUES OF CURRENT CONCERN INCLUDINGJURISDICTIONAL PROBLEMS, NATIONAL COORDINATION, AND THE CONTROL AND DIRECTIONOF NETWORK ACTIVITIES ARE DISCUSSED.
3705|LIBRARY NETWORKS.     THE MOST EFFICIENT TYPE OF NETWORK HAS GLOBAL AS WELL AS LOCAL ELEMENTS THATPROVIDE SYSTEM STANDARDS AS WELL AS LOCAL FLEXIBILITY.

IT HAS HOWEVER NO REAL INFLUENCE ON LIBRARY POLICY. FURTHER ADVANCESDEPEND ON INCREASED FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND AN ACTIVE MEMBERSHIP. IT IS ANESSENTIAL LINK BETWEEN LIBRARY STAFF AND THE ASSOCIATION OF LOCAL AUTHORITIES.BETTER-ORGANISED COOPERATION WITH OTHER LIBRARY BODIES IS IMPORTANT. THEINFLUENCE OF LIBRARY WORKERS MUST BE STRENGTHENED IN MAJOR FIELDS CONCERNINGLIBRARY POLICY, SUCH AS THE NATIONAL LIBRARY COUNCIL, LIBRARY EDUCATION, ANDCOMPUTERISATION.

3857|THE CASE FOR COPYRIGHT.     PAPER PRESENTED AT THE 54|TH ASLIB ANNUAL CONFERENCE, INFORMATION '81|'FORECASTS AND REALITIES, OXFORD UNIVERSITY, UK, 22|-25| SEPT 81|. ARGUES FOR THELICENSING OF PHOTOCOPYING FROM THE UK PUBLISHERS' POINT OF VIEW, SHOWING HOWTHE PRESENT COPYRIGHT ACT IS DIFFICULT TO ENFORCE.
3858|PROBLEMS OF CATALOGUING AND CLASSIFICATION IN THEATER LIBRARIANSHIP.     PROBLEMS IN CATALOGUING AND CLASSIFYING THEATRE RESOURCES HAVE SIGNIFICANTLYCONTRIBUTED TO THE DIFFICULTIES OF THEATRE LIBRARIANSHIP. THE UNSUITABILITY OFMAJOR EXISTING CLASSIFICATION SYSTEMS FOR USE WITH THEATRE COLLECTIONS HASPROMPTED LIBRARIANS TO SEEK ALTERNATIVES, SUCH AS MODIFICATIONS AND ORIGINALCLASSIFICATIONS. ADDITIONALLY, COLLECTIONS OF NON-BOOK, OR 'FUGITIVE',THEATRICAL MEMORABILIA ARE PRACTICALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO CATALOGUE PROPERLY, GIVENTHE DESPERATE FINANCIAL SITUATION FACING MANY THEATRE COLLECTIONS. US SURVEYDATA ON CURRENT PRACTICES INDICATE A STRONG TREND TOWARD STANDARDISATION OFPROCEDURES IN CLASSIFYING, YET A CONTINUING DIVERSITY IN CATALOGUING METHODS.THE COMING OF COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY, ALONG WITH INCREASED AWARENESS AMONGTHEATRE LIBRARIANS AND INPUT FROM CONCERNED PROFESSIONAL ORGANISATIONS, MAYHELP ALLEVIATE SOME OF THESE PROBLEMS IN THE FUTURE.
3859|HOW DO LIBRARIES CATALOGUE.     THE WORKING GROUP ON CATALOGUING IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES SURVEYED THE FINNISHPUBLIC LIBRARY SYSTEM TO FIND OUT ABOUT CATALOGUING METHODS IN PUBLICLIBRARIES. 461| QUESTIONNAIRES WERE SENT AND 409| WERE RETURNED. THE WORKINGGROUP IS DESIGNING A COMPUTERISED CATALOGUING SYSTEM FOR PUBLIC LIBRARIES.JUST OVER 70|% OF THE RESPONDENTS USE FINNISH CATALOGUING RULES. JUST UNDER 50|%OF THE RESPONDENTS USE THEIR OWN SUBJECT INDEXING AND NEARLY 87|% OF THERESPONDENTS USE THE 1975| EDITION OF THE FINNISH CLASSIFICATION SCHEME BASED ONDEWEY. OVER 50|% USE THE CENTRALISED CATALOGUING SERVICE OF KIRJASTOPALVELU OY,AND NEARLY 60|% OF THE RESPONDING LIBRARY AUTHORITIES UNDERTAKE CENTRALISEDCATALOGUING.

3861|LIBRARY CATALOG DESIGN.     COMPUTERISATION MAKES POSSIBLE ENLARGEMENT OF THE PURPOSE AND MEANS FORATTAINING PURPOSE OF LIBRARY CATALOGUES. COMPUTERISED CATALOGUES PROVIDE THEFUNCTIONS OF TRADITIONAL CATALOGUES TOGETHER WITH IMPORTANT NEW FUNCTIONS.
3862|IN THE IRON AGE OF CATALOGUING.     CUTTER DESCRIBED THE 19|TH CENTURY HISTORY OF CATALOGUING AS THE GOLDEN AGE.EXTENDS THIS METAPHOR TO THE 20|TH CENTURY TO ELUCIDATE CURRENT TRENDS INCATALOGUING, ESPECIALLY THOSE INVOLVING THE USE OF THE COMPUTER. DOES THEAUTOMATION OF THE CATALOGUE REPRESENT A TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCE THAT WILL FREEUS FROM THE DIFFICULTIES OF MAIN ENTRY AND PROVIDE FOR CUTTER'S 2|ND OBJECT?ARGUES THAT THE CATALOGUING TRADITION OF PANIZZI, CUTTER, AND LUBETZKY WILL BEEVEN MORE VALID, AND THAT A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE PRINCIPLES OFCATALOGUING WILL BE REQUIRED IN THE FUTURE.
3863|BILD-INTEGRATED ONLINE SYSTEM FOR ECONOMIC AND BUSINESS LIBRARIES.     BILD, BIBLIOGRAPHIC INDEX OF LIBRARY DOCUMENTS IS THE NEW INTEGRATED ON-LINESYSTEM DEVELOPED FOR THE HELSINKI SCHOOL OF ECONOMICS LIBRARY. IT CONSISTS OFTHE ACQUISITION, CATALOGUING AND CLASSIFICATION FUNCTIONS OF THE LIBRARY.THERE IS ALSO A SEARCH PROGRAM FOR INFORMATION RETRIEVAL AVAILABLE. THE SYSTEMWAS TESTED DURING THE WINTER 1980|-81|.
3864|A SUBJECT ACCESS PROJECT (SAP)-A NEW TEST DATABASE FOR ESA-QUEST.     WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THE SUBJECT ACCESS PROJECT, A NEW VERSION OFON-LINE-CATALOGUE FOR MONOGRAPHIC PUBLICATIONS HAS BEEN DEVELOPED. IT IS ANEFFECTIVE AID FOR SEARCHES BY SUBJECT AS WELL AS BIBLIOGRAPHIC DATA. THE IDEAOF SAP IS TO PRODUCE SUBJECT DESCRIPTIONS OF BOOKS TAKEN FROM THE BOOKSTHEMSELVES AND TO MAKE MORE USE OF THE INHERENT ATTRIBUTES OF A PUBLICATION.TO MAKE POSSIBLE A DEEPER ANALYSIS OF THE EFFECTS OF SAP-INDEXING TECHNIQUETHE DATA BASE HAS BEEN CONVERTED TO ESA-QUEST AS A TEST FILE.
3865|PICA (PROJECT GEINTEGREERDE CATALOGUS AUTOMATISERING) AT THE START OF THE1980|S.     IN 1977| THE PICA (PROJECT FOR INTEGRATED CATALOGUE AUTOMATION) SYSTEM BECAMEOPERATIONAL IN THE NETHERLANDS. THE PICA NETWORK IS THE RESULT OF AN AGREEMENTCONCLUDED BY THE DUTCH GOVERNMENT AND UNIVERSITIES IN 1969|. IN ADDITION ANUMBER OF OTHER LIBRARIES, INCLUDING LEEUWAARDEN COUNTY LIBRARY AND THE PUBLICLIBRARIES OF AMSTERDAM AND THE HAGUE ARE MEMBERS OF THE NETWORK AS 'CUSTOMER'LIBRARIES. OVERALL SUPERVISION OF THE NETWORK IS MAINTAINED BY THE PICA BUREAULOCATED IN THE ROYAL LIBRARY. MEMBER LIBRARIES CONTRIBUTE CATALOGUE RECORDSVIA ON-LINE VISUAL DISPLAY TERMINALS DIRECT TO THE CENTRAL DATA BASE, FROMWHICH OUTPUT MAY BE OBTAINED IN THE FORM OF CATALOGUE CARDS, PAPER PRINTOUT ORMICROFICHE. IN 1982| THE CENTRAL DATA BASE WILL BE ADAPTED FOR USE INACQUISITION AND LOANS CONTROL SYSTEMS AND IN 1983| WILL BE USED FOR THENATIONAL INTERLIBRARY-LENDING NETWORK.
3866|THE CASE OF THE MISSING SUBTITLE.     WITH REFERENCE TO THE RELEVANT PASSAGES IN AACR2| AND ISBD(G), NOTES THEELIMINATION OF THE TERM 'SUBTITLE' AND THE RESULTANT DIFFICULTIES. SUBTITLESWILL NOT DISAPPEAR JUST BECAUSE THEY ARE NO LONGER CALLED BY THAT NAME. THETERM MUST BE REINSTATED IN THE OFFICIAL VOCABULARY OF CATALOGUING ANDOPERATIONAL DEFINITIONS OF 'TITLE PROPER' AND 'SUBTITLE' FORMULATED. SUCHACTION WOULD GO A LONG WAY TOWARDS UNIFORM IMPLEMENTATION OF THE RULES,LEAVING MUCH LESS TO THE INDIVIDUAL INTERPRETATION OF THE CATALOGUES ANDRESULTING IN GREATER ENTRY STANDARDISATION.
3867|REPORT OF THE TASK FORCE ON CATALOG USAGE.     AFTER CONSIDERING THE EFFECTS OF AACR2| ON THE PRESENT CATALOGUE SYSTEM, THISTASK FORCE ON CATALOGUE USAGE RECOMMENDS THAT THE UNIVERSITY LIBRARY RETAINTHE PRESENT CATALOGUE BEYOND 1981| AND LATER ADOPT AN ON-LINE CATALOGUE.

3869|PREPARATION OF SPECIALIZED INDEXES AND ITS NECESSITIES IN REFERENCE SERVICES(IN JAPANESE).     ORIGINALLY PRESENTED AT THE 4|TH INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS ON MEDICALLIBRARIANSHIP HELD IN BELGRADE, YUGOSLAVIA, 2|-5| SEPT 80|. ON-LINE LITERATURERETRIEVAL SERVICES CURRENTLY AVAILABLE IN JAPAN ARE JOIS, TOOL-IR, IDEAS/77|,DIALOG, AND ORBIT. GENERAL LIMITATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH LITERATURE RETRIEVALSERVICES ARE: (1|) DATA BASES DO NOT COVER CERTAIN PRIMARY SOURCES; (2|)SECONDARY SOURCES IN THE MEDICAL FIELD SUCH AS IGAKU CHUO ZASSHI AND BERICHITE& ZENTRALBLATTER ARE NOT AVAILABLE ON-LINE; (3|) INDEXING OF INFORMATION IS NOTEXCLUSIVE, EVEN IF THE PRIMARY SOURCE IS COVERED BY THE DATA BASE. IN ORDER TOCOMPENSATE FOR THESE PROBLEMS, THE NIPPON MEDICAL SCHOOL LIBRARY PRODUCESINDEX CARDS FOR SPECIAL FEATURE ARTICLES WHICH ARE NOT EASILY RETRIEVED,SYNDROMES OF DISEASES, AND MEETINGS HELD BY SOCIETIES WITHOUT OFFICIALPUBLICATIONS.

3872|THE CATALOGING OF SERIALS IN MICROFORM UNDER AACR 2| RULES.     UNTIL THE PUBLICATION OF 2|AACR 2|,1| THE ANGLO-AMERICAN CATALOGING RULESDICTATED THAT MICROFORM REPRODUCTIONS BE CATALOGUED UNDER THE GENERAL RULESFOR MONOGRAPHS, SERIALS, MUSIC, ETC., THE CHIEF SOURCE OF INFORMATION BEINGTHE TITLE PAGE OF THE ORIGINAL. 2|AACR 2| 1|RULES REVERSE THIS PRACTICE ANDSEPARATE THE ORIGINAL FROM THE FILM REPRODUCTION IN THE CATALOGUE AND IN TURNDO A DISSERVICE TO THE USER.
3873|AACR 2| AND LEGAL MATERIALS.     REVIEWS THE RULES IN AACR2| WHICH APPLY TO LEGAL MATERIALS. CONCLUDES THAT THENEW CODE IS BETTER THAN ITS PREDECESSOR BUT IS STILL LIKELY TO CAUSE CONFUSIONAND HINDER THE LOCATION OF INFORMATION.
3874|GERMAN ALPHABETICAL CATALOGUING RULES FOR PUBLIC LIBRARIES AND FOR ACADEMICLIBRARIES.     AT THE MEETINGS IN MAY AND JUNE 81| THE DEUTSCHE BIBLIOTHEKSINSTITUT (GERMANLIBRARY INSTITUTE) COMMITTEE ON ALPHABETICAL CATALOGUING WAS CONCERNED WITHTHE DRAFT VERSION OF RAK-OB. LARGE PUBLIC LIBRARIES TEND TO ACCEPT THIS IFTHEY HAVE NOT ALREADY OPTED FOR THE ACADEMIC LIBRARY VERSION BUT SMALLERPUBLIC LIBRARIES STOCKING MAINLY GERMAN LANGUAGE MATERIAL ARE CRITICAL OF THEDRAFT. IT WAS DECIDED, THEREFORE, THAT ALTERNATIVES FOR SMALL PUBLIC LIBRARIESBE INCLUDED IN RAK-OB WITH REFERENCE TO PERSONAL NAMES, CORPORATE BODIES, UNITSUBJECT HEADINGS, PARALLEL HEADINGS, SUBORDINATE ENTRIES, ENTRIES FORMUSICALIA AND SOUND RECORDINGS FOR CHILDREN. RAK-OB AND RAK-WB MUST NOT DIFFERON BASIC PRINCIPLES BUT ARE TO BE KEPT PHYSICALLY SEPARATE. RAK-OB'S 2|ND DRAFTPLAN WILL BE PUBLISHED SOON.
3875|A CRITICAL SURVEY OF UNION CATALOGUES IN UNIVERSITIES.     EFFORTS MADE SINCE THE MID 19|TH CENTURY TO PRODUCE ALPHABETICAL UNIONCATALOGUES OF ALL BOOKS WITHIN A UNIVERSITY HAVE BEEN HAMPERED BY THEDIFFICULTY OF ACCESS TO SOME INSTITUTE LIBRARY STOCKS, BY INACCURATECATALOGUING IN INSTITUTE LIBRARIES AND BY THE QUESTIONABLE VALUE OF A CENTRALCATALOGUE WITHIN PURCHASING POLICY. SINCE 1970|, HOWEVER, PROFESSIONAL OPINIONHAS BEEN INCREASINGLY IN FAVOUR OF UNION CATALOGUES IN UNIVERSITIES; WORK INTHIS FIELD AT VARIOUS UNIVERSITIES IS DESCRIBED AND EVALUATED THROUGH ANALYSISOF INTERLIBRARY LOAN FIGURES. THESE CATALOGUES SHOULD BE PRODUCED ONLY WHENCERTAIN CONDITIONS PREVAIL, E.G. WHEN INSTITUTE STOCK SUBJECT COVERAGE IS MUCHWIDER THAN THAT OF THE CENTRAL LIBRARY, WHEN ACCESS TO THE UNION CATALOGUE ISEASY AND WHEN THE CATALOGUE CAN BE PRODUCED WITHOUT DETRIMENT TO OTHER WORK.
3876|COMPLETE CATALOGUE OF OLD PRINTED WORKS IN CYRILLIC AND GLAGOLITIC CHARACTERS'BASIC THEORY AND METHODOLOGY.     THERE HAS BEEN A GROWING DEMAND FOR A COMPLETE CATALOGUE OF CYRILLIC ANDGLAGOLITIC PRINTED WORKS OF THE 15|TH-17|TH CENTURIES.

THEUNION CATALOGUE IS SUPPLEMENTED BY PERSONAL AND CORPORATE NAME INDEXESINCLUDING PUBLISHERS, EDITORS, AUTHORS AND ARTISTS. THERE IS ALSO ACHRONOLOGICAL INDEX AND A PUBLISHERS INDEX ARRANGED BY TOWNS.
3878|PLANS FOR AN ON-LINE CATALOG AT THE UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS.     THE INCREASING SIZE, COST, AND COMPLEXITY OF THE CARD CATALOGUE HAS CAUSED THELIBRARY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN TO BEGIN PLANNINGFOR AN ON-LINE PUBLIC CATALOGUE. THE LIBRARY HAS DECIDED TO USE THE SOFTWAREOF THE WASHINGTON LIBRARY NETWORK (WLN) AS THE BASIS FOR AN ON-LINE CATALOGUEWHILE CONTINUING TO USE OCLC AS A SOURCE OF BIBLIOGRAPHIC RECORDS. THE PLANSFOR REPLICATING THE WLN SOFTWARE AT ILLINOIS AS AN ON-LINE CATALOGUE AND THEIMPLICATIONS OF THIS FOR STATEWIDE RESOURCE SHARING ARE DISCUSSED.
3879|THE PENNSYLVANIA UNION LIST OF SERIALS INITIAL DEVELOPMENT.     THE PENNSYLVANIA UNION LIST OF SERIALS IS A NEW PROJECT FUNDED BY THE STATELIBRARY OF PENNSYLVANIA. IN 1979| IT AWARDED THE PITTSBURGH REGIONAL LIBRARYCENTER $99|,304| IN LSCA TITLE III FUNDS FOR FIRST YEAR DEVELOPMENT OF ASTATEWIDE UNION LIST WHICH WILL BE ON-LINE THROUGH OCLC. PRLC'S HISTORY OFWORKING WITH ON-LINE UNION LISTS IS REVIEWED, AND PLANS FOR THE FIRST YEAR AREDESCRIBED. INITIALLY, THERE WILL BE CONCENTRATION ON SYSTEM DESIGN. AT THESAME TIME, A CORE LIST OF APPROXIMATELY 2|,000| TITLES WILL BE SELECTED, AS WILLTHE LIBRARIES TO PARTICIPATE DURING 1979|-1980|. FUTURE PLANS WILL CONSIDER SOMEDECENTRALISATION.
3880|SOME LINGUISTIC ASPECTS OF DUAL NATURE OF PATENT DOCUMENTATION.     LINGUISTIC EFFECTS OF CONTRADICTIONS BETWEEN LEGAL AND TECHNICAL ASPECTS OFPATENT INFORMATION ARE EXAMINED. LINGUISTIC METHODS OF FORMULATING THEPATENTS' INDICATORS, VARIANTS OF THEIR AMALGAMATION AND DISTRIBUTION IN THELIMITED AND DISTINCTIVE PARTS OF THE FORMULA ARE DISCUSSED. SPECIAL ATTENTIONIS PAID TO THE CONFLICTS BETWEEN LINEAR AND STRUCTURAL ORDER OF PATENTINDICATORS AND THEIR COMPONENTS. CRITERIA FOR OPTIMAL SYNTACTIC STRUCTURE AREINTRODUCED AND SYNTACTIC COMPLEXITY OF THE FORMULA IS EVALUATED. THEIMPORTANCE OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF LINGUISTIC RECOMMENDATION ENABLING ONE TOBUILD THE OPTIMAL FORMULA WITHOUT BREAKING GRAMMATICAL RULES, STYLE AND LEGALREQUIREMENTS IS STRESSED.
3881|CLASSIFICATION AS A STRUCTURAL TYPE OF SUBLANGUAGES OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY.     DISCUSSES SOME ASPECTS OF THE STRUCTURE AND LEXICAL COMPOSITION ANALYSIS OFTHE SUBLANGUAGES OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY. DEMONSTRATES THE POSSIBILITIES OFTHE SIMULTANEOUS USE OF CLASSIFICATIONS (PARTICULARLY SUBJECT CLASSIFICATIONS)AS AN INFORMATION RETRIEVAL LANGUAGE AND AS A SUBLANGUAGE OF SCIENCE ANDTECHNOLOGY.
3882|CLASSIFICATION OF HOMOSEXUALITY.     CRITICISES THE PLACING OF 'HOMOSEXUALITY' IN 2| CLASSIFICATION SYSTEMS, DEWEY(NORWEGIAN SUBJECT INDEX 1979|) AND ARNESEN, THE NORWEGIAN VERSION OF DEWEY(SUBJECT INDEX 1969|). BOTH MAKE THE UNTENABLE ASSUMPTION THAT HOMOSEXUALITY ISBY DEFINITION A SEXUAL DEVIATION. IN RECENT YEARS HOMOSEXUAL ORGANISATIONSHAVE WON SOME SYMPATHY FOR THEIR VIEW OF HOMOSEXUALITY AS A WAY OF LIFE ASVALID AS HETEROSEXUALITY, BUT THIS ASPECT IS NOT REPRESENTED IN THE TABLES.EVEN THE MOST NEUTRAL PLACING, 301|.45| MINORITIES, HAS OVERTONES OF INFERIORITYAND DISCRIMINATION.
3883|UDC AND HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES.     THE FOLLOWING PAPERS WERE GIVEN IN A UDC CONFERENCE IN JYVASKYLA IN SPRING 81|:GENERAL OVERVIEW OF PRESENT UDC; UDC AND AUTOMATED INFORMATION HANDLING; CHAININDEXING; CATALOGUING FINNISH LITERATURE; AND CENTRALISED CATALOGUING. ONE OFTHE MAJOR PROBLEMS OF UDC IS ITS SLOW MACHINERY FOR REVISION. THE STRUCTURE OFTHE SCHEME IS WELL SUITED FOR AUTOMATIC APPLICATION. UDC IS USED FOR THECLASSIFICATION OF LEGAL DEPOSIT MATERIALS IN FINLAND. THE PRESENT FINNISHEDITION OF THE SCHEME NEEDS URGENT REVISION, PARTICULARLY IN THE HUMANITIESSUBJECTS.
3884|TEXTBOOK CLASSIFICATION SCHEME. A REPORT FROM THE EDUCATIONAL MATERIALS REVIEWCENTER (EDMARC).     A TEXTBOOK CLASSIFICATION SCHEME THAT ALLOWS THE EXPRESSION OF CURRICULARRELATIONSHIPS IS REVISED TO INCLUDE NEW CURRICULUM MATERIALS FOR MATHS,SCIENCE, SPECIAL EDUCATION, CAREER EDUCATION, FOREIGN LANGUAGES, AND SOCIALSTUDIES. DESIGNED FOR TEACHER TRAINING INSTITUTIONS, CURRICULUM LABORATORIES,RESOURCE CENTRES, AND COLLECTIONS IN SCHOOL LIBRARIES, THIS SCHEME CAN BE USEDSEPARATELY OR TO SUPPLEMENT STANDARD CLASSIFICATION SYSTEMS, WHICH, WHILE THEYHAVE PROVISION FOR TEXTBOOKS, DO NOT MAKE PLAIN THE CURRICULAR RELATIONSHIPSINVOLVED.

ON THE BASIS OF THE FOCAL NUMBERING OF EACH BENZENOID RING IN THE GRAPHITELATTICE, ANY POLYHEX (CATA-, PERI, AND CORONA-FUSED POLYCYCLIC BENZENOIDSYSTEM) CAN BE CODED BY MAKING USE OF (1|) THE DUALIST GRAPH OF THE POLYHEX AND(2|) THE RECENT GENERALISATION OF THE TOPOLOGICAL CENTRE CONCEPT. THE NUMERICALCODE CAN BE USED FOR NOMENCLATURE PURPOSES, AND THE PRESENT APPROACH CAN BEEASILY GENERALISED TO CONDENSED NONBENZENOID SYSTEMS AS WILL BE SHOWN INFUTURE PUBLICATIONS.
3900|PIGGY IN THE MIDDLE: OBSERVATIONS ON THE ROLE OF THE INTERMEDIARY.     IT WAS CONFIDENTLY EXPECTED BY SYSTEM DESIGNERS THAT ON-LINE BIBLIOGRAPHICSEARCH SYSTEMS, WITH THEIR ABILITY TO PROVIDE DIRECT AND IMMEDIATE ACCESS TOINFORMATION, WOULD BE INTERROGATED BY THE END USER. A REVIEW OF THE LITERATUREREVEALS HOWEVER, THAT CONTRARY TO SUCH EXPECTATIONS, MOST SEARCHES ARE STILLBEING PERFORMED BY TRAINED INTERMEDIARIES. CLEARLY, THE ATTEMPT TO CONVERTFORMER OFF-LINE BATCH SYSTEMS USED BY EITHER COMPUTER SCIENTISTS ORINFORMATION SPECIALISTS, INTO ON-LINE INTERACTIVE SYSTEMS FOR USE BY ALL HASNOT WORKED, DESPITE THE CLAIMS OF THEIR DESIGNERS TO HAVING DEVELOPED 'USERFRIENDLY' SYSTEMS.
3901|AN EXPERT SYSTEM AS AN ONLINE SEARCH INTERMEDIARY.     EXAMINES THE APPLICATION OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TO ON-LINE SEARCH SYSTEMSBY THE DEVELOPMENT OF EXPERT SYSTEMS WHICH CAN BE INTERPOSED BETWEEN THE USERAND THE SEARCH SYSTEM. THE EXPERT SYSTEM WOULD SERVE AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO AHUMAN INTERMEDIARY.
3902|MY WISH IS YOUR COMMAND??.     THE INCREASING NUMBER OF DATA BASES AND DATA BANK SUPPLIERS HAS BROUGHT WITHIT THE PROBLEM THAT DIFFERENT HOST COMPUTERS MUST NORMALLY BE ACCESSED USINGDIFFERENT COMMAND LANGUAGES. MANY OF THESE LANGUAGES BEAR RELATIONSHIPS TO ONEANOTHER, BY VIRTUE OF COMMON ANCESTRY, COMMON DESIGN PHILOSOPHY, ETC. EVEN SO,THE SAME LANGUAGE CAN BE IMPLEMENTED DIFFERENTLY BY 2| SUPPLIERS. DIFFERENTIMPLEMENTATIONS AND/OR LANGUAGES MUST BE CONSIDERED BY ON-LINE USERS BEFORECONTRACTING WITH A HOST. THE CONSEQUENCES OF LEARNING A NEW COMMAND SET,BUYING ADDITIONAL MANUALS, AND ATTENDING EXTRA COURSES ARE ALL ECONOMIC ONES,AND ARE PARTICULARLY RELEVANT WHEN A DATA BASE IS OFFERED BY SEVERALSUPPLIERS.
3903|WHY STANDARDS FOR COMMAND LANGUAGES?.     THERE ARE MANY REASONS WHY THE GROWTH AND SPREAD IN THE USE OF ON-LINEINFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS HAS BEEN LESS DRAMATIC THAN MIGHT HAVE BEENEXPECTED. ONE OF THE OBSTACLES FACING THE USER IS THE NEED TO MASTER MANYDIVERSE USER INTERFACES. SEVERAL SOLUTIONS ARE OFFERED, YET, THE ONLY ONEWHICH IS REALLY OPEN AT PRESENT IS TO DECLINE TO USE ALL BUT 1| OR 2| FAMILIARSYSTEMS, ACCEPTING THAT SOME POTENTIALLY VALUABLE INFORMATION WILL BE MISSED.THE MAIN ALTERNATIVES SEEM TO BE THE ADOPTION OF STANDARDS BY SYSTEM OPERATORSOR THE USE OF TRANSLATING SOFTWARE SOMEWHERE BETWEEN THE USER AND THERETRIEVAL SYSTEMS. WITH THE ADVENT OF THE MICROPROCESSOR AND THE INTELLIGENTTERMINAL, THIS LATTER ALTERNATIVE BECOMES MORE ATTRACTIVE AND IT MAY APPEAR,AT 1|ST SIGHT, THAT THE NEED FOR STANDARDS FOR COMMAND LANGUAGES IS THEREFORELESSENED, OR EVEN DISAPPEARS TOTALLY. HOWEVER, CAREFUL CONSIDERATION OF THEPOSSIBILITIES OFFERED LEADS TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THE ADOPTI ON OF STANDARDSWILL BE MORE RATHER THAN LESS IMPORTANT IF MUCH OF THE POTENTIAL IS TO BEREALISED.
