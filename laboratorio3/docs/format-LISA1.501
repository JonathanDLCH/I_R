1510|USING QUALITATIVE METHODS.     CONTRIBUTION TO A SPECIAL ISSUE ON APPLICATION OF QUALITATIVE APPROACHES TOTHE STUDY OF INFORMATION PROBLEMS. AN IN-DEPTH DISCUSSION OF ONE QUALITATIVEAPPROACH-ETHNOGRAPHY. ITS DISTINCTIVE CHARACTER DERIVES FROM ITS UNDERLYINGMETHODOLOGICAL PRINCIPLES-A CONCERN WITH THE DISCOVERY, GENERATION, ANDDEVELOPMENT, AS WELL AS TESTING, OF THEORY; A COMMITMENT TO LEARNING THECULTURE OF THOSE BEING STUDIED; AND A RECOGNITION OF THE IMPORTANCE OFCONTEXT. AGAINST THIS BACKGROUND, OUTLINES SOME ETHNOGRAPHICALTECHNIQUES-GROUNDED THEORISING (THEORETICAL SAMPLING AND THE CONSTANTCOMPARATIVE METHOD) AND TESTING THEORY (TRIANGULATION AND ANALYTIC INDUCTION).STRESSES THAT THIS IS A RESEARCH TRADITION STILL IN THE THROES OF DEVELOPMENT.
1511|SOURCES OF ANTAGONISM TO 'QUALITATIVE' RESEARCH.     CONTRIBUTION TO AN ISSUE ON THE APPLICATION OF QUALITATIVE APPROACHES TO THESTUDY OF INFORMATION PROBLEMS. CONSIDERS WHY QUANTITATIVE METHODS ARE BELIEVEDTO BE MORE 'SCIENTIFIC', RIGOROUS, AND VALID THAN QUALITATIVE ONES AND ARGUESTHAT THE TERM 'QUALITATIVE' IS APPLIED TO DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF RESEARCH WHICHARE SUFFICIENTLY INDEPENDENT OF EACH OTHER TO MAKE THEQUANTITATIVE/QUALITATIVE DISTINCTION ARTIFICIAL. SUGGESTS THAT CRITICISMS OFQUALITATIVE RESEARCH ARE 'IDEOLOGICAL IN THE SENSE THAT THEY GIVE SUPPORT TOEXISTING INSTITUTIONS WHEREIN SOME CLASSES OR GROUPS (RESEARCH SPONSORS) TRYTO EXERT CONTROL OVER OTHERS'. TYPICAL CRITICISMS OF SUCH RESEARCH AREANALYSED TO EXPOSE THE NATURE OF THE UNDERLYING EXPRESSIONS OF INTEREST.
1512|A CASE STUDY IN QUALITATIVE RESEARCH?.     CONTRIBUTION TO AN ISSUE ON THE APPLICATION OF QUALITATIVE APPROACHES TO THESTUDY OF INFORMATION PROBLEMS. REFLECTS UPON THE METHODOLOGY ADOPTED BY THEAUTHOR IN PROJECT INISS (INFORMATION NEEDS AND INFORMATION SERVICES IN LOCALAUTHORITY SOCIAL SERVICES DEPARTMENTS). THE CHOSEN METHOD, STRUCTUREDOBSERVATION, COMBINED QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE MODES OF ANALYSIS ANDREPORTING. CONSIDERS VARIOUS RESEARCH MANAGEMENT ISSUES IN FIELD RESEARCH OFTHIS KIND. THE AUTHOR'S AIM IS TO FIND A MEANS OF GATHERING MORE MEANINGFULQUANTITATIVE DATA RATHER THAN REJECTING QUANTITATIVE DATA AS SUCH.

AN ACCOUNT OF THE BACKGROUND AGAINST WHICH ANON-TRADITIONAL STRATEGY OF EVALUATION WAS ADOPTED IN NEWCASTLE-UPON-TYNEPOLYTECHNIC'S TRAVELLING WORKSHOPS EXPERIMENT (SEE 77|/3731|). THE CLEAR-CUTDISTINCTIONS ORIGINALLY ENVISAGED FOR THE INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL COMPONENTS OFTHE EVALUATION BECAME BLURRED AND THERE WAS CONFLICT BETWEEN PRESSURES FOR ATRADITIONAL, TIGHTLY-CONTROLLED EVALUATION AND THE RESEARCHERS' PREFERENCE FORA MORE EXPLANATORY EVALUATION STRATEGY. ILLUMINATIVE EVALUATION WAS USED; THISESCHEWS PRE- AND POST-TESTING IN FAVOUR OF A WIDE-RANGING STUDY OF THECONTEXTUAL DETERMINANTS OF A VENTURE'S SUCCESS. ITS USE POSES MANY PROBLEMSBECAUSE IT IS A BROAD STRATEGY RATHER THAN A SET OF SPECIFIC TECHNIQUES.
1514|USING CASE STUDY IN LIBRARY RESEARCH.     CONTRIBUTION TO AN ISSUE DEVOTED TO THE APPLICATION OF QUALITATIVE APPROACHESTO THE STUDY OF INFORMATION PROBLEMS. EXAMINES CASE-STUDY RESEARCH, ITSDEVELOPMENT, AND ITS CHARACTERISTICS.

1519|INFORMATION SCIENCE IN SCIENTIFIC COMMUNICATIONS.     A LOOK AT INFORMATION RECURRENCE AND A COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF SCIENTIFICINFORMATION AND OTHER ACTIVITIES IN THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNICATION FRAMEWORK AREBROUGHT TO BEAR ON A VERIFICATION OF THE CONCEPT OF INFORMATION SCIENCE. THISIS PROVED TO BE SCIENTIFIC AND MORE SELECTIVE IN INFORMATION SERVICE THANLIBRARY, TRANSLATION, OR PUBLISHING ACTIVITIES. IT DIFFERS FROM RESEARCH ANDDEVELOPMENT BY ITS GOALS AND FUNCTIONS. ARGUES THAT INFORMATION TASKS SHOULDBE DISTRIBUTED AMONG THE INFORMATION UNITS AND RESEARCH OR DESIGN DIVISIONS OFA GIVEN ENTERPRISE OR OFFICE.
1520|INFORMATION SCIENCE AND INFORMATION DESIGN' HAVE THEY ANYTHING TO COMMUNICATETO ONE ANOTHER?.

1523|THE PROFESSIONAL PREPARATION OF LIBRARIANS AT UNIVERSITY LEVEL.     THE PROFESSIONAL TRAINING OF LIBRARIANS HAS NOT IMPROVED IN ITALY DURING THELAST 50| YEARS. UNIVERSITY REFORM HAS COMPLETELY IGNORED THE PROBLEM OF LIBRARYORGANISATION IN RESPECT OF RESEARCH AND TEACHING. LIBRARIANS SHOULD TAKEDEGREE COURSES IN THE SPECIFIC DISCIPLINES OF THE CULTURAL AREAS SERVED BY THELIBRARIES IN WHICH THEY INTEND TO WORK. PROFESSIONAL PREPARATION CANNOT BECONSIDERED COMPLETE WITHOUT ADEQUATE PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE. LIBRARIANS LACKINGTHE CAPACITY TO ORGANISE A LIBRARY ON TRADITIONAL LINES WILL NOT PROFIT MUCHFROM THE ASSISTANCE OF ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY. THE UNIVERSITY SHOULD RATIONALISEITS OWN LIBRARIES AND CONCENTRATE ITS INTERNAL SERVICES AT ALL LEVELS ONSATISFYING THE REQUESTS OF ALL POTENTIAL READERS.

LIBRARIES MUST HELP IMMIGRANTS TO RETAIN THEIR MOTHERTONGUE AS WELL AS TO LEARN SWEDISH. THERE ARE GOVERNMENTAL GUIDELINES ONSTOCKING OF IMMIGRANT LITERATURE AND CHANNELS OF SUPPLY ARE AVAILABLE, BUTCOORDINATION OF ACQUISITION AND CATALOGUING IS NEEDED. MORE CONTACT WITHIMMIGRANT ORGANISATIONS AND BETTER EDUCATION OF LIBRARIANS ARE NECESSARY. WHATHAS ALREADY BEEN DONE IS LARGELY DUE TO THE WORK OF THE SWEDISH LIBRARYASSOCIATION'S WORKING PARTY ON IMMIGRANT AND MINORITY QUESTIONS.

1824|AUTOMATED ACQUISITIONS SYSTEMS' KEYNOTE ADDRESS.     CONTRIBUTION TO THE LITA (AMERICAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION. LIBRARY ANDINFORMATION TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION) INSTITUTE. LIBRARIANS SHOULD BE AWARE OFTHE RAPID PROGRESS BEING MADE TOWARD INTEGRATED SYSTEMS AND MAKE THEACQUISITIONS AUTOMATION DECISION IN THAT LIGHT. CONTRASTS THE MID-60|S ANDEARLY 80|S IN TERMS OF TECHNOLOGY AND LIBRARY NEEDS. IN THE MID-60|S, EMPHASISWAS ON ORDERING, AND TECHNOLOGY WAS LIMITING BOTH IN TERMS OF COSTS ANDCAPABILITIES. AT THE BEGINNING OF THE 80|S LIBRARIES HAVE NUMEROUS ACQUISITIONSAVAILABLE, INCLUDING TURNKEY SYSTEMS FROM SOME CIRCULATION SYSTEM VENDORS ANDTHE ACQUISITIONS SUBSYSTEMS OF THE BIBLIOGRAPHIC UTILITIES. IT IS UNLIKELYTHAT A SINGLE SOURCE WILL OFFER A LIBRARY THE MOST SUITABLE FEATURES FOR EACHFUNCTION, AND THE PROBLEM BECOMES ONE OF INTEGRATING SYSTEMS FROM SEVERALSOURCES.
1825|LOCAL SYSTEMS' DESIGN AND COSTS.     CONTRIBUTION TO THE LITA (AMERICAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION. LIBRARY ANDINFORMATION TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION) INSTITUTE. A LOCAL APPROACH TO THEAUTOMATION OF ACQUISITIONS PROCESSES WAS, UNTIL COMPARATIVELY RECENTLY, THEONLY ALTERNATIVE AVAILABLE. GUIDELINES FOR THE DESIGN PROCESS ARE WELLDOCUMENTED; COSTS ARE NOT. INVESTIGATES PITFALLS TO A LOCAL APPROACH AND LISTSALTERNATIVES. EXPLORES TRENDS SUCH AS THE INCREASING IMPORTANCE OF INTERFACEWITH NATIONAL OR OTHER LOCAL SYSTEMS, AND THE GREATER DEMANDS FOR MANAGERIALDATA.

SURVEYS INTERLENDINGIN THE COUNTRIES WHICH COMPRISE THE CONSORTIUM OF NATIONAL LIBRARIES ANDDOCUMENTATION CENTRES, SOUTH-EAST ASIA-INDONESIA, MALAYSIA, THE PHILIPPINES,SINGAPORE AND THAILAND. A QUESTIONNAIRE SURVEY REVEALED THAT THE VOLUME OFINTERLENDING VARIED GREATLY BETWEEN THESE COUNTRIES AND WAS GENERALLY LOW.MANY MORE INTERLIBRARY LOAN REQUESTS WERE SENT ABROAD THAN WERE RECEIVED. ONLYA FEW LIBRARIES HAD TELEPHONE AND TELEX LINKS, BUT MANY HAD REPROGRAPHICEQUIPMENT. REQUESTS WERE SENT MAINLY TO SUBJECT SPECIALIST LIBRARIES, ANDUNION CATALOGUES AND CENTRAL COLLECTIONS WERE LESS USED. CHARGES WERE MINIMAL.STRESSES THE IMPORTANCE OF MAINTAINING NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL STATISTICS.THIS IS 1| FUNCTION OF NATIONAL INTERLENDING CENTRES, WHICH SHOULD BEESTABLISHED AS INDEPENDENT UNITS IN ALL COUN TRIES.
1839|COMPUTER NETWORKS SYSTEMS' THE IMPACT OF TECHNOLOGY ON CO-OPERATIVEINTERLENDING IN THE USA.     REVISED VERSION OF A PAPER PRESENTED AT THE INTERNATIONAL SEMINAR ON NATIONALDOCUMENT PROVISION, BOSTON SPA, 22|-24| SEPT 80|. RECENT US DEVELOPMENTS HAVEFAVOURED DECENTRALISED NETWORKS RATHER THAN CENTRALISED RESOURCE LIBRARIES.

DESCRIBES THE 3| MAJOR COMPUTERCOMPUTER UTILITIES. THESE COMPUTER NETWORKS WOULD BE COMPLEMENTED NOTDUPLICATED BY CENTRAL RESOURCE LIBRARIES; WITH THE NATIONAL PERIODICALS CENTEREFFECTIVELY SHELVED, THE CENTER FOR RESEARCH LIBRARIES COULD ASSUME A MOREDYNAMIC ROLE. COMMERCIAL VENDORS ARE OFTEN OVERLOOKED, BUT ARE AN IMPORTANTELEMENT IN DOCUMENT DELIVERY SYSTEMS. THEY ARE COMPLETELY OUTSIDE CONVENTIONALLIBRARY SYSTEMS, AND MIGHT CREAM OFF THE PROFITABLE END OF THE DOCUMENT SUPPLYMARKET .

1842|THE CONSERVATION OF LIBRARY COLLECTIONS IN TROPICAL AND SUB-TROPICALCONDITIONS' THE PROBLEMS OF THE INCREASED DANGERS OF DAMAGE AND DECAY IN AREASOF HIGH TEMPERATURE AND HUMIDITY.     THE GENERAL POINT IS STRESSED THAT LIBRARY COLLECTIONS IN TROPICAL ANDSUB-TROPICAL CLIMATES ARE SUBJECT TO THE SAME DANGERS AS THOSE IN MODERATECLIMATE ZONES; BUT IT MUST BE UNDERSTOOD THAT ALL THESE DANGERS ARE INCREASED,SOME OF THEM DRAMATICALLY, IN WARM DAMP CLIMATES. IN TROPICAL AND SUB-TROPICALCLIMATES THERE IS THE THREAT OF DAMAGE BY INSECTS OF A NATURE AND TO AN EXTENTTHAT IS UNKNOWN IN MODERATE CLIMATE ZONES AND FINALLY, IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TOCHANGE THIS SITUATION FUNDAMENTALLY BY ANY CONSERVATION OR RESTORATIONMEASURES, AT LEAST NOT WITHOUT AN EXPENDITURE THAT WOULD BE UNREALISTIC INPRESENT TERMS OF MANPOWER AND ENERGY.

1845|FIRST, DO NO HARM' GIVING ADVICE ABOUT PHOTO-CONSERVATION.     IN 1979| IN THE USA, OVER 10| BILLION EXPOSURES WERE MADE BY 45| BILLION CAMERAS,BUT MOST OF THESE PHOTOGRAPHS WILL EVENTUALLY BE LOST, THROWN AWAY,SELF-DESTRUCT OR BE FORGOTTEN BEFORE ANYONE EVEN THINKS OF PRESERVING THEM FORPOSTERITY. MANY INSTITUTIONS HAVE ALREADY AMASSED TOO MANY PHOTOGRAPHS, AND SOPERHAPS PRESERVATION MUST BE CARRIED OUT BY THE PHOTOGRAPHS' ORIGINATORS. ONLYNOW IS SOME EFFORT BEING MADE TO ESTABLISH PROGRAMMES FOR THE FORMAL TRAININGOF CONSERVATORS, AND MOST AMATEURS STILL WANT CHEAP, QUICK AND EASY SOLUTIONS.IT FALLS TO LIBRARIANS, ARCHIVISTS AND CURATORS, THEREFORE TO MAKE USEFULINFORMATION READILY AVAILABLE TO THOSE WHO ASK FOR IT AND TO BE PREPARED TOCARRY IT TO THOSE WHO DO NOT.
