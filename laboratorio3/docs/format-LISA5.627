5677|BIBLIOMETRIC STUDIES ON A PROTEIN-RICH CROP: THE COWPEA.2| BIBLIOGRAPHIES ON COWPEAS, ONE COVERING THE PERIOD 1888|-1949| AND THE OTHER1950|-1973|, WERE ANALYSED TO STUDY VARIOUS CHARACTERISTICS OF THE LITERATURE.RESULTS SHOWED THAT GROWTH OF THE LITERATURE HAS BEEN EXPONENTIAL, DOUBLINGEVERY 20| YEARS, WITH THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE ACCOUNTING FOR OVER 87|% OF THELITERATURE. THOUGH THE PERIODICAL WAS THE MOST POPULAR PUBLISHING MEDIUM,FORMAT CHANGES WERE EVIDENT AND BRADFORD DISTRIBUTIONS OF THE 2| GROUPSRESULTED IN A THIRD BRADFORD DISTRIBUTION WHEN MERGED.
5678|THE EXAMINATION OF RESEARCH TRENDS BY ANALYSIS OF PUBLICATION NUMBERS.DESCRIBES A METHOD USED TO EXAMINE TRENDS IN TEXTILE RESEARCH OVER THE PERIOD1960|-79|. THE METHOD CONSISTED OF A COUNT OF RESEARCH PAPERS AND PATENTS, INSPECIFIC SUBJECT AREAS, USING 2|WORLD TEXTILE ABSTRACTS1|, 2|CHEMICAL ABSTRACTS1|,2|JOURNAL OF THE TEXTILE INSTITUTE1| AND 2|TEXTILE RESEARCH JOURNAL1| AS SOURCESOF DATA.

5680|MUSIC AND THEATRE COLLECTIONS IN MADRID MUNICIPAL LIBRARY.THE LIBRARY IS DESCRIBED AS A 'HIDDEN JEWEL' IN THE OLD CITY OF MADRID. IT WASFOUNDED IN 1876| AND SINCE 1930| HAS SHARED A BUILDING WITH THE MUNICIPALMUSEUM. IT HOUSES THE RICHEST COLLECTION OF SPANISH MUSIC TO BE FOUNDANYWHERE, AND MANY OLD MANUSCRIPTS FROM HISTORIC MADRID THEATRES. THERE ARE8|,430| VALUABLE LIBRETTI AND SCORES, MAINLY OF THE PERIOD 1750|-1890|, TOGETHERWITH COLLECTIONS OF MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS, OPERAS AND PLAYS. A CATALOGUE WASPUBLISHED IN 1965|.

DESCRIBESTHE DEVELOPMENT OF THE COLLECTION, STARTED IN THE EARLY 1970|S. SECONDARYMATERIAL ON THE GENRE HAS BEEN OBTAINED TO FACILITATE RESEARCH. DISCUSSES THEVALUES OFFERED BY CRIME FICTION.
5682|REGIONAL COLLABORATION IN THE SWEDISH LIBRARY SYSTEM.CONTRIBUTION TO AN ISSUE DEVOTED TO PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVICES IN SWEDEN.SWEDEN'S PUBLIC LIBRARIES ARE BASICALLY OPERATED BY THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES. THESTATE CAN PROVIDE GRANTS TO LEVEL OUT STANDARDS BUT DOES NOT INTERFERE IN THERUNNING OF LOCAL LIBRARIES, AND SWEDEN HAS NO LIBRARIES ACT. MUNICIPALAUTHORITIES THEMSELVES DECIDE THE OBJECTIVES, SCALE AND STRUCTURE OF THEIRLIBRARY SERVICES. ALL OF SWEDEN'S 279| MUNICIPALITIES PROVIDE MUNICIPAL LIBRARYSERVICES. CERTAIN LIBRARY FUNCTIONS WOULD BE TOO EXPENSIVE TO OPERATE ON APURELY MUNICIPAL BASIS-IT IS THEREFORE RATIONAL AND EFFICIENT TO TRANSFERTHESE TO THE REGIONAL OR SUPRAMUNICIPAL-THAT IS, COUNTY-LEVEL.
5683|PLANNING A WAGON LIBRARY SERVICE FOR THE SR-6| STATE RAILWAY NETWORK, RIOGRANDE DO SUL, BRAZIL.A PROJECT PRESENTED TO THE BRAZILIAN RAILWAY BORAD IN 1980|, BASED ON PREVIOUSEXPERIENCE WITH MOBILE LIBRARIES. THE WAGON LIBRARY WOULD CIRCULATE THROUGHOUTTHE NETWORK HOOKED UP TO A PASSENGER TRAIN; THE POTENTIAL BENEFITS INPROMOTING READING ARE DISCUSSED, AND DETAILS GIVEN OF THE ESTIMATED STAFF,STOCK, AND EQUIPMENT REQUIRED. PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATING AND CONTROLLING THESERVICE ARE OUTLINED, AND A VARIETY OF ADDITIONAL EXTENSION ACTIVITIES WHICHCOULD OPERATE FROM THE WAGON AS A BASE SUGGESTED.
5684|INVISIBLE COLLEGES AS A BASIS FOR PLANNING SPECIAL LIBRARY SERVICES. A REVIEWOF THE LITERATURE.EXPLAINS HOW INVISIBLE COLLEGES FACILITATE TRANSMISSION OF INFORMATION AMONGMEMBERS OF SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITIES, CITING PUBLISHED RESEARCH AS EVIDENCE.THERE IS NO EVIDENCE IN THE LITERATURE TO SHOW THAT LIBRARIANS HAVECAPITALISED ON THIS PHENOMENON. PROPOSES THAT INFORMATION CENTRES IDENTIFY THEINTERESTS OF USER COMMUNITIES AND KEEP FILES ON THEIR ACTIVITIES,DISSEMINATING THIS INFORMATION AS PART OF THEIR REFERENCE SERVICES.
5685|WHICH WAY FOR SCHOOL MEDIA SERVICES TO TURN?.IN THE NETHERLANDS THERE HAS BEEN MUCH DISCUSSION IN RECENT YEARS ON THETRANSFER OF SCHOOL LIBRARY SERVICES FROM THE PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVICE TO THERESPONSIBILITY OF THE LOCAL EDUCATION AUTHORITIES. IN THE PRESENT SITUATION OFCUTBACKS IN PUBLIC LIBRARY FINANCES THERE IS CONSIDERABLE SUPPORT FOR SUCH ATRANSFER. HOWEVER, SCHOOL LIBRARIANS EMPLOYED BY THE PUBLIC LIBRARYAUTHORITIES, ARE AS MUCH A PART OF THE SCHOOL 'SUPPORT' STAFF AS EDUCATIONALPSYCHOLOGISTS AND SOCIAL WORKERS ALSO FOUND IN SCHOOLS. LIBRARIANS EXPERIENCEDIN THE PROVISION OF CHILDREN'S LIBRARY SERVICES ARE IN THE BEST POSITION TOORGANISE SCHOOL LIBRARIES WITH THEIR GROWING COLLECTIONS OF AUDIO-VISUALMATERIALS AS WELL AS THEIR BOOKSTOCK.
5686|LIBRARY NETWORK IN THE SLOVAK SOCIALIST REPUBLIC AND ITS FUTURE DEVELOPMENT.THE RECENT COMMUNIST PARTY CONGRESS AND REQUIREMENTS OF THE 7|TH 5|-YEAR-PLAN(1981|-85|) HAVE GIVEN A NEW IMPETUS TO THE WHOLE LIBRARY NETWORK IN SLOVAKIA.SINCE 1| JAN 82|, A SPECIAL SECTION OF MATICA SLOVENSKA, BASED IN BRATISLAVA,HAS BEEN IN OPERATION. ITS STAFF HAVE TO WATCH, DIRECT AND CONTROL BOTH SHORT-AND LONG-TERM PLANNING IN LIBRARIES. THEY WILL ALSO CARE FOR COORDINATIONBETWEEN LIBRARIES AND CENTRES OF SCIENTIFIC, TECHNICAL AND ECONOMICINFORMATION. CONTACTS WITH LIBRARIES IN THE CZECH SOCIALIST REPUBLIC AS WELLAS INTERNATIONAL CONNECTIONS WILL ALSO BE FURTHERED. THE OVERALLRESPONSIBILITY FOR LIBRARIES, HOWEVER, RESTS UPON THE SLOVAK MINISTRY OFCULTURE. FOR THEIR PART, THE MINISTRY'S OFFICIALS WILL MAKE EVERY EFFORTTOWARDS UNIFICATION AND/OR STANDARDISATION OF ALL LIBRARY ACTIVITIES,INCLUDING BUILDING UP BOOK COLLECTIONS, RECORDS, STATISTICS AND THE LIKE.AMONG OTHER PROBLEMS WHICH MUST BE TACKLED IN  THE FORSEEABLE FUTURE ARECOMPUTERISATION, MERGERS OF PUBLIC AND SCHOOL LIBRARIES, WHERE APPROPRIATE,AND INCORPORATION OF PUBLIC LIBRARIES INTO LOCAL CULTURAL INSTITUTIONS.
5687|NETWORKS.REVISED VERSION OF A PAPER PRESENTED TO A MEETING ON REGIONAL LIBRARYCOOPERATION IN DEVENTER, 19| NOV 81|. IN THE NETHERLANDS COOPERATION AMONGSTLIBRARIES OF ALL TYPES HAS COME UNDER CLOSE EXAMINATION AS A RESULT OF THEINCLUSION OF PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVICES IN THE PROPOSED PUBLIC SERVICES ACT. THECONCEPT OF LIBRARY NETWORKS DATES FROM THE EARLY 1900|S WHEN THE NEED FORLIBRARIES TO SHARE THEIR RESOURCES WAS RECOGNISED. THE MOST EFFECTIVE LIBRARYNETWORKS ARE THOSE NETWORKS WHICH OPERATE THEIR SERVICES ON A FINANCIAL BASIS.IN ADDITION, THE COORDINATION OF ACQUISITION POLICIES, CATALOGUING SERVICESAND INTERLIBRARY LENDING AMONGST MEMBERS OF A LIBRARY NETWORK REQUIRES THEMOST UP-TO-DATE TELECOMMUNICATION AND COMPUTER EQUIPMENT. WITHIN EACH NETWORKA CENTRAL LIBRARY SHOULD BE DESIGNATED TO ACT AS A CLEARING-HOUSE FOR THETRANSFER OF INFORMATION.
5688|EXTRA-MURAL FUNCTIONS OF UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES.FOR OVER 10| YEARS PUBLIC LIBRARIES HAVE BEEN BUYING MORE ACADEMIC LITERATURETHAN BEFORE AND UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES OFFERING THE USE OF THEIR FACILITIES TOPEOPLE OUTSIDE THE UNIVERSITY. THIS EXTRA-MURAL WORK MUST NOT BE REDUCEDBECAUSE OF FINANCIAL PROBLEMS; THE OBVIOUS NEED FOR ACADEMIC MATERIAL MUST BESATISFIED AND INTER-LIBRARY LOANS AND PURCHASING SCHEMES MUST RESULT IN ABETTER COORDINATED AND MORE ECONOMICAL USE OF LITERATURE. THE BUILDING UP OFUNION CATALOGUES USING ELECTRONIC DATA PROCESSING AND OF DECENTRALISEDMICROFICHE AND SCREEN TEXT SERVICES WILL EASE THE DEMAND ON UNIVERSITY SPECIALCOLLECTIONS. ISOLATION OF UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES WILL NOT IMPROVE THEIR PUBLICIMAGE AND COULD PROVE COSTLY.
5689|THE WORK OF THE STUDY GROUP OF DIRECTORS OF UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES.IN THE LIBRARY SYSTEM OF EAST GERMANY, THE UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES OF BERLIN,DRESDEN, GREIFSWALD, HALLE, JENA, LEIPZIG AND ROSTOCK PLAY AN IMPORTANT PARTIN INTER-LIBRARY LOAN SCHEMES AND IN THE ACQUISITION OF SPECIALISED STOCKS. IN1980| THESE UNIVERSITIES OWNED TOTAL STOCKS OF 18| MILLION ITEMS. THE STUDYGROUP PROVIDES ADVICE ON ORGANISATION, WITH PARTICULAR REFERENCE TO THEDEVELOPMENT OF THE UNIFIED SYSTEM OF A CENTRAL UNIVERSITY LIBRARY WITHASSOCIATED BRANCHES AND PROMOTES EXCHANGES AND ANALYSES OF EXPERIENCE. THEGROUP IS CURRENTLY CONCENTRATING ON INTER-LIBRARY COOPERATION WITHIN SUBJECTNETWORKS, WITH A VIEW TO IMRPOVING PURCHASING POLICY. IMPROVEMENTS MUST ALSOBE MADE IN THE COOPERATION BETWEEN UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES, INFORMATION CENTRESAND RESEARCH, IN USER TRAINING AND IN THE APPLICATION OF TECHNOLOGY.

5691|INTERACTION WITHIN THE TECHNICAL REPORTS COMMUNITY.THERE IS A GROWING INTERDEPENDENCE AMONG THE MAJOR US FEDERAL TECHNICALREPORTS PROCESSING AGENCIES, THE SCIENCE/TECHNOLOGY LIBRARIES/INFORMATIONCENTRES AND COMMERCIAL SERVICES WITH WHICH THEY INTERACT. IN THISINTERCONNECTED INFORMATION NETWORK, THE PARTICIPANTS BOTH FEED AND USE THESYSTEM TO FULFIL THEIR MISSIONS IN REGARD TO TRANSFERRING GOVERNMENT RESEARCHAND DEVELOPMENT RESULTS. COOPERATIVE ARRANGEMENTS AMONG THE PARTICIPANTS ANDSHARING OF RESOURCES ARE BECOMING INCREASINGLY IMPERATIVE IN ORDER TO LOWERCOSTS AND INCREASE EFFICIENCY. RECENT STEPS TAKEN TOWARDS THESE ARE DESCRIBED.

SOMELARGE RESEARCH LIBRARIES AT PRESENT UNDER A DIFFERENT MINISTRY FROM THEMINISTRY OF CULTURE, WILL REMAIN OUTSIDE THE CENTRAL CONTROL, ALTHOUGH GENERALDEVELOPMENT PLANNING FOR ALL RESEARCH LIBRARIES IS TO BE CENTRALLYADMINISTERED. THERE WILL BE NO DIRECT STATE FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR PUBLICLIBRARIES IN GENERAL, BUT SOME SPECIFIED LIBRARIES AND ACTIVITIES WILL RECEIVESTATE GRANTS. THE JOINT APPROPRIATION IS TO REMAIN AND WILL INCLUDE THEPRESENT DISPENSATION FUND. DATES ARE SET FOR THE INTRODUCTION OF FULL TIMESERVICE AND OF MUSICAL MATERIAL IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES.

DE BOER FIRMLY SUPPORTS THE NEW PUBLICSERVICES ACT WHICH WILL DECENTRALISE RUNNING OF THE PUBLIC SERVICES, INCLUDINGPUBLIC LIBRARIES, FROM NATIONAL TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT LEVEL. DE BOER BELIEVESTHAT INVOLVEMENT OF THE LOCAL COMMUNITY IN THE RUNNING OF THESE SERVICES ISTHE BEST GUARANTEE FOR IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF THE SERVICE. PLANS FOREXTENDING THE AGE LIMIT FOR FREE PUBLIC LIBRARY MEMBERSHIP FROM 16| TO 18| YEARSOF AGE HAVE BEEN ABANDONED BY DE BOER BECAUSE OF FINANCIAL CUTBACKS INGOVERNMENT SUPPORT. THE ALTERNATIVE, DE BOER BELIEVES, WOULD HAVE BEEN AREDUCTION IN THE STANDARD OF SERVICE.

POSTMA, CHAIRMAN OF THE NBLC ON THE 10|THANNIVERSARY OF THE FOUNDING OF THE CENTRE. POSTMA BELIEVES THAT LIBRARIANS INTHE NETHERLANDS SHOULD NOW COME TO TERMS WITH THE NEW PUBLIC SERVICES ACT,WHICH WILL REPLACE THE EXISTING PUBLIC LIBRARIES ACT. BY REFUSING TO ACCEPTTHE ACT LIBRARIANS ARE IN DANGER OF BEING LEFT OUT IN THE COLD. IN POSTMA'SVIEW THE DANGER OF THE NEW ACT LIES IN THE DEVOLUTION OF RESPONSIBILITY FORTHE PUBLIC SERVICES, INCLUDING PUBLIC LIBRARIES, FROM NATIONAL TO LOCALGOVERNMENT. IN SOME LOCAL AUTHORITIES, HE ADDS, TOWN FESTIVALS MAY RECEIVEGREATER PRIORITY THAN THE LIBRARY SERVICE. THE NBLC MUST CONVINCE THEGOVERNMENT OF THE NEED FOR AN INFORMATION ACT WHICH INCLUDES THE PUBLICLIBRARY SERVICE. (FOR AN ABSTRACT OF PART 1|, 2|SEE1| 82|/5007|).

5699|DISCUSSION AND COMMUNICATION FOR STAFF IN THE HOOGEVEEN PUBLIC LIBRARY.IN 1971| A SCHEME OF WORKER PARTICIPATION WAS INTRODUCED AT HOOGEVEEN PUBLICLIBRARY IN THE NETHERLANDS. PREVIOUSLY STAFF MEETINGS WERE RESTRICTED TOADMINISTRATIVE STAFF ONLY. UNDER THE NEW SYSTEM WEEKLY MEETINGS WERE HELD ATWHICH THE CHIEF LIBRARIAN AND HEADS OF THE ADULT AND CHILDREN'S DEPARTMENTSWERE PRESENT. REPORTS OF THESE MEETINGS WERE CIRCULATED TO ALL HEADS OFDEPARTMENTS. IN 1975| FOLLOWING THE OPENING OF A NEW CENTRAL LIBRARY THELIBRARY SERVICE WAS REORGANISED INTO 8| DEPARTMENTS AND A NEW STRUCTURE OFSTAFF MEETINGS WAS INTRODUCED. IN ADDITION TO THE MEETINGS ATTENDED BYADMINISTRATIVE STAFF AND HEADS OF DEPARTMENTS, ALL STAFF OF THE INTERNALSERVICES MEET EVERY 3| WEEKS, WHILE STAFF OF THE EXTERNAL SERVICES MEET EACHWEEK. THE PURPOSE OF THESE MEETINGS IS TO IMPROVE STAFF MOTIVATION AND THEREBYTHE QUALITY OF THE LIBRARY'S SERVICES.
5700|CENTRALISATION AND DECENTRALISATION' ONE POINT OF VIEW.EXAMINES THE DEBATE ON CENTRALISATION AND DECENTRALISATION IN RELATION TO' THEHISTORICAL ASPECTS, SHOWING HOW IN GENERAL THE LATIN AMERICAN UNIVERSITYSYSTEM AT PRESENT DEVELOPED FROM THE ORIGINAL EUROPEAN PATTERN; THEINSTITUTIONAL ASPECTS, WHERE THE NECESSITY FOR UNIVERSITIES TO FULFIL THEIRRESPONSIBILITIES DICTATES ADMINISTRATIVE STRUCTURES, IN TURN GOVERNING LIBRARYORGANISATION; THE TECHNICAL-ADMINISTRATIVE ASPECTS, OUTLINING THE ESSENTIALCHARACTERISTICS OF CENTRALISED, PARTIALLY DECENTRALISED, AND DECENTRALISEDSYSTEMS; AND GEOGRAPHICAL FACTORS. THIS SURVEY LEADS TO THE CONCLUSION THATTHE PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES OF EACH PARTICULAR CASE SHOULD DETERMINEADMINISTRATIVE AND ORGANISATIONAL STRUCTURES.
5701|THE METHODOLOGICAL CENTRE FOR THE RESEARCH LIBRARIES AND INFORMATION ANDDOCUMENTATION SERVICES OF THE MINISTRY FOR UNIVERSITY AND TECHNICAL COLLEGEAFFAIRS.THE CENTRE ASSISTS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF CENTRAL SUBJECT LIBRARIES AND SUBJECTNETWORKS AND PROMOTES THE USE OF ELECTRONIC DATA PROCESSING IN LIBRARIES ANDINFORMATION CENTRES IN EAST GERMANY.

5703|CHILDREN'S LIBRARY WORK AMONG ADULTS.CONTRIBUTION TO AN ISSUE DEVOTED TO PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVICES IN SWEDEN. ACOUNTRY WITH A RICH PUBLICATION OF CHILDREN'S LITERATURE SHOULD ALSO HAVEWELL-APPOINTED AND FLOURISHING CHILDREN'S LIBRARIES. CHILDREN'S LIBRARIES HAVEEXISTED IN SWEDEN FOR 70| YEARS, BUT NOT UNTIL THE 1970|S, WITH GREATEDUCATIONAL REFORMS, WAS PRIORITY ACCORDED TO LIBRARY ACTIVITIES FOR CHILDREN.FROM THE LATE 1970|S, LIBRARY CONSULTANTS' POSTS HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED ATALMOST ALL THE COUNTY LIBRARIES.

5706|ALL LIBRARY SERVICE SHOULD BE FREE OF CHARGE.IN THE BILL FOR A NEW DANISH LIBRARY ACT, WHICH WILL SHORTLY BE TABLED IN THEFOLKETING, THE CLAUSE REGARDING A FREE LIBRARY SERVICE WILL, IT SEEMS, BERETAINED. QUESTIONS WHETHER THE PARTIES WHO BELIEVE THAT A CHARGE SHOULD BELEVIED FOR LIBRARY USE WILL MANAGE TO INFLUENCE THE FINAL FORM OF THE ACT. IFTHE PRINCIPLE OF A FREE SERVICE GOES BY THE BOARD, EVERY IDEA OF AN EQUALSERVICE TO ALL WILL GO BY THE BOARD WITH IT, WITH THE CONSEQUENT BAD EFFECT ONPUBLISHING HOUSES, BOOKSHOPS AND AUTHORS.
5707|FAIR PLAY WITH THE CAKE, YOU KNOW?'.DISCUSSES THE ECONOMIC CUTS AS THEY AFFECT THE LIBRARY SERVICES. THEGOVERNMENT'S SAVINGS CIRCULAR RECOMMENDED THAT LOCAL AUTHORITIES CUT LIBRARYEXPENDITURE TO 185| KR PER CAPITA, AS, IT WAS ARGUED, PUBLIC LIBRARIES SHOWEDSIGNS OF UNCONTROLLED GROWTH. THE LIBRARIANS' UNION HAS, HOWEVER, CALCULATEDPUBLIC LIBRARIES' REAL GROWTH IN 1980| AS WITHIN THE GOVERNMENT'S RECOMMENDED3|%; THIS IS SUPPORTED BY THE LIBRARY INSPECTORATE. THE FIGURES FOR 1981|INDICATE AN AVERAGE FALL IN REAL GROWTH OF 1|.4|%. THE LIBRARIANS' UNION HASEXAMINED THE LOCAL EFFECTS OF CUTS AND FOUND THAT FRINGE SERVICES LIKEOUTREACH ACTIVITIES ARE WORST HIT AND THAT STAFF APPOINTMENTS ARE FROZEN. THEGOVERNMENT'S TECHNOCRATS HAVE DRAWN UP MODELS FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF THEPUBLIC SECTOR, BUT LIBRARIANS' ANSWER MUST BE THAT THE DEVELOPMENT OF THELIBRARY PART OF THIS SECTOR IS NOT A TECHNICAL MATTER ONLY, BUT THAT CULTURALASPECTS ARE EQUALLY IMPORTANT.
5708|GANGS OF SAVERS IN A DANCE OF CRANES.4| MEMBERS OF THE LIBRARIANS' UNION'S WORKING PARTY ON SAVINGS WERE ASKED TOEVALUATE THE LIBRARY SITUATION IN VIEW OF THE CUTS IN EXPENDITURE. THEYDISCUSSED THE FIGURES RELATING TO RUNNING COSTS, STAFF AND MATERIAL COSTSPRODUCED BY THE LIBRARY INSPECTORATE AND THE EFFECTS OF CUTS ON WORK LOADS ANDLOANS. VIEWS DIFFERED AS TO WHETHER MINIMUM NORMS SHOULD BE LAID DOWN. THEYAGREED THAT THE UNION AS A CENTRAL ORGANISATION COULD DO LITTLE TO GIVEGUIDELINES FOR ACTION IN LOCAL SITUATIONS. SOME THOUGHT MEMBERS SHOULD REFUSETO TAKE PART IN LOCAL WORKING GROUPS ON SAVINGS SET UP TO GIVE PRIORITIES TOCUTS IN DIFFERENT AREAS, AS THIS WAS TANTAMOUNT TO CONDONING CUTS, OTHERSTHOUGHT USEFUL INFORMATION COULD BE GAINED FROM PARTICIPATION AND THAT LOCALLIBRARIANS SHOULD PRESENT POLITICANS WITH WELL ARGUED BUDGET PROPOSALS ANDOUTLINE EFFECTS OF PARTICULAR CUTS.
5709|CABLE LIBRARY SURVEY RESULTS.PUBLIC SERVICE SATELLITE CONSORTIUM CONDUCTED A SURVEY OF ACADEMIC LIBRARIES,IN 1980|, TO STUDY THEIR DATA COMMUNICATIONS NEEDS AND SERVICES.

AUTOMATION IN LIBRARIES TENDS TO LAGBEHIND AUTOMATION IN OTHER FIELDS BUT IT DEMANDS CHANGES IN STAFF TRAINING,INTELLECTUALISATION OF PRODUCTION WORK AND A NEW RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PUBLICAND ACADEMIC LIBRARIES. PROCESSES PREVIOUSLY SEPARATED CAN BE INTEGRATED BYAUTOMATION. BEFORE AUTOMATION THERE WAS A TENDENCY TOWARDS RIGIDITY IN THEHIGHER STAFF GRADES; NOW AUTOMATION REQUIRES CHANGES IN THE STAFF HIERARCHYAND THE OLD IDEA OF THE 'CLASSICAL LIBRARIAN'.

OPPONENTS OFAUTOMATION POINT TO THE SOCIAL IMPLICATIONS OF THE REPLACEMENT OF MAN BYMACHINES. A FURTHER GROUP SUGGESTS THAT THE USE OF AUTOMATION IN LIBRARIESDEPENDS ON THE NATURE OF THE WORK TO BE DONE AND ASSERTS THAT CERTAINTECHNICAL AIDS, SUCH AS THE TELEPHONE AND THE PHOTOCOPIER, ARE REGARDED ASESSENTIAL TO A LIBRARY'S SERVICES. IN SPITE OF UNEMPLOYMENT IT IS BECOMINGINCREASINGLY DIFFICULT TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN STAFF FOR CERTAIN TASKS INLIBRARIES. IN SUCH CASES AUTOMATION CAN BE OF GREAT ASSISTANCE.

GIVES A SHORT HISTORICAL REVIEW OF FORMAL QUALIFICATIONSREQUIRED OF APPLICANTS TO QUALIFIED LIBRARIANS' POSTS IN SWEDISH ACADEMICLIBRARIES. SHOWS HOW NEW DEVELOPMENTS IN EDUCATION AND RESEARCH AS WELL AS INLIBRARY TECHNIQUES HAVE AFFECTED CONDITIONS OF WORK IN A LIBRARY. NEW TASKSHAVE BEEN ADDED TO THE TRADITIONAL ONES, AND IT IS NECESSARY TO FIND WAYS OFRECONCILING THE NEW DEVELOPMENT WITH EXISTING LIBRARY EXPERTISE, AND TO FIND ACOMMON DOMINATOR WHICH WILL WORK TOWARDS AN INTEGRATION OF ALL TASKS IN ALIBRARY. THIS IS FOUND IN THE OVERALL AIMS FOR LIBRARY WORK' TO MEET THE NEEDSOF THE CUSTOMER.

NO LIBRARY PUBLICATION HAS REPORTEDON OR EVALUATED NLA'S POSITION PAPERS ON A NATIONWIDE SYSTEM OF CERTIFICATIONFOR LIBRARIANS AND ON PROFESSIONAL WELFARE. LIBRARY SCHOOLS TEND TO IGNORENLA'S OFFERS TO PROVIDE SPEAKERS OR INFORMATION MATERIALS. IN MANY WAYS NLAHAS ACHIEVED A GREAT DEAL, BUT IT STANDS AT A CRITICAL POINT IN ITSDEVELOPMENT.
